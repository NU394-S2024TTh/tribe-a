If you've never watched the original ditch this farce and go watch the original, you won't be disappointed. If they make a season 2 of this tripe I won't watch a second of it.",

And It has been brought up to date, and I don\u2019t  mean the kids will necessarily like it, but his relationship with his kids and work colleagues is def for our generation. Love it! Nicholas Lyndhurst is fantastic.  The script is clever and well written and the comedic timing is perfect.",

I used to laugh a lot when waching the original Frasier. I'm on episode 5 of the reboot and haven't laughed once! It's good that Frasier has almost the same personality although they have destroyed his decorating touch since his apartment looks terrible. That is not his taste. Niles son might, might have some of his father's touch. Freddie needs something. I don't know what. It feels like a slapstick show, so depressing.  I was a fan of Frasier when it aired originally in 1993 and just binged on the whole 11 years, maybe in less than three weeks, enjoying it to the hilt. In this reboot, if it werent for Kelsey Grammer, I wouldn't watch it at all.",

I think the casting was amazing the fact that his brilliant son kind of takes softer his father, John Mahoney And Nelson is exactly who I would expect Nelson to be the show has heart and it takes me to a wonderful place when I watch it Kelsey Grammer's amazing he can't help himself but again the supporting cast is fantastic. That's how I feel. I don't need it to be the original Frazier time moves on But the sentiment of the original is still there, so I think of it as a continuation more so than a reboot, because the story continues answering those questions. Who would Frazier son who would Niles son be? And I love the examination of growing up crane. What does that do to you? I guess we can tell I'm gushing I love it.",

The supporting cast took a little getting used to but, after the first three episodes, we were hooked.\nNow season one has concluded, and what a conclusion with the surprise and delight at seeing Roz again!  Nicholas Lyndhurst is no stranger to us in the UK for his comic roles, and he's a great addition to the cast.  The only one I find it difficult to warm towards is the character of David.  I feel sorry for the actor, as the part written for him is ridiculous and silly.  I'm hoping they can manage to give him a deeper 'character' in the future - so far he is just a barely credible buffoon seemingly tasked with trying to imitate some of the physical comedy that Niles carried off so perfectly in the original series.  That's my only groan with this new series: David's character doesn't work for me.\nWe took out a subscription to Paramount + just to see this reboot, and I desperately hope that there will be a second series.  It's rare these days for us to look forward so much to a TV show that is amusing, clever and free of gutter humour.  A class act indeed!",

The humour, warmth and intelligence set it apart from cheap, pandering sitcoms for my entire adult life. It set a bar that so many comedies just couldn't reach. It still makes me roar laughing now, a thousand watches later, and has such a comforting effect to this day. The reboot \u2026 oh my goodness it's so so far from the original. Unrecognisable. Inately flawed. Unfunny, slow, cheap. No quick wit, no intelligence, no natural flow. Painfully obvious punchlines, stilted acting, unlikable cast, unrelatable stories, no layering or cleverness. Honestly, in my opinion, it is so bad that I feel deeply sad and betrayed as a Frasier fan.",

Mixed reviews I believe are partially due to certain misconceptions brought on by the \"norm\" of other sitcoms in recent years. Such as \"canned laughter.\" It should be known that the laughter is genuine, and this was filmed in front of a live studio audience with high praise. Others find it a privilege to see what our beloved characters are up to nowadays. I feel the writing is above average and considering the series is just getting its footing, I'd love to see where this goes. It has plenty to offer, and it's obvious the cast enjoys working with one another. I would love to unpack another 3-4 Seasons at least given the minimal 10 Episode packaging. Kelsey Grammer has been phenomenal thus far. This role fits him like a glove. It is possible that with time, and if left organically to fate that David Hyde Pierce may reconsider playing an on again, off again role. It's understandable to want to see that role reprised. However, that is yet to be seen and I have faith this will age like a fine wine. Trust the process and you will be grateful you did. A special thanks to Kelsey, and the rest of the cast and crew.

But for some reason, I find myself enjoying this series far more than I expected. The humor is a bit \"old-fashioned\" and occasionally predictable, but these is something FUN when the segments are pulled off with such skill and perfect timing. The main characters (except for maybe the son), are all so engaging. And even the side characters grab your attention. In particular, Fraser's nephew steals each scene he has. He is a hilarious goofball. \n\nFinal verdict: Far more fun than I expected.",

It is disgraceful to see how far away they made the son and nephew characters from the reality of who the characters' parents were. The younger Freddie was charming and had individuality beyond his years, which is what we would expect from a child of Frasier and Lilith. The nephew likewise, should be uniquely who we would expect from Niles and Daphne, who were amazing characters on the old show.  WTH are the writers? Are they deeply unaware of the norms and mores of the original Frasier? Are they younger folks who want to bring the show into the recent eras of sloppy, rude, dumb characters so commonly seen today? Where's the wit? The charm? Why is this so slapstick, and poorly done, as opposed to the distinctive storylines and sharp quips that garnered the original show a plethora of awards and fame? The Frasier reboot is corny, with unappealing characters further made inferior by poor acting. This is not a great show. This not fun. This is shameful to the fans of the original Frasier.

Cutmore-Scott is G-level acting, at best, while Salgueiro is wringing out all she can get from a dry, hollowly written character, and Grammer is shamelessly, lazily, under-working a complex character in his (acting and) production. The whole thing is on par with 90's Nickelodeon writing for very young children's shows. No joke -- the writers NEED to be switched out, and the characters need to be respected as the hilarious, richly complex characters with non-tinny plots. The whole thing is vapid, lacks real charm, actual belly laughs, and real issues. Replace Cutmore-Scott immediately (he ought to be on stage with 5th grade performances  - fire whoever cast him too -- no, really -- this is a glaring, super obvious mis-cast), improve the David character from a 2-dimensional buffoon to something significantly better which really represents the culmination of two of the best characters ever, Niles and Daphne, and their dynamic merge. So pissed. So disappointed. Clinical Psychologists, professors, attorneys, writers, actors, teachers, etc... watching for HIGH-END HUMOR and rich writing here! Your audience is not only smart, but very smart. Genuinely doing a disservice to Hyde Pierce, Gilpin, and our beloved Mahoney, who were TOP TIER ACTORS, and effin' HILLARIOUS. Don't need to bring back former characters, but do need to respect and honor the show, Frasier realm, and Frasier-specific audience. Hung in there the whole awful first season, hoping producers, Grammer, Russo, and McMahon, would get it together before the end, but it actually never improves. At all. Not in writing, production, acting, comedy, timing, or casting. Without a massive overhaul, these fools will tarnish the whole show. Super rude, disrespectful treatment of the best show of all time. Initially thought the show was on life-support out the gate (at least it's alive?), but nerrrrp, Frasier revival is dead on arrival. Current team: you are not deserving, at this point, of audience returning for another round of witnessing your abuse. For real - Grammer, you really effed this up under your Production purview. Unforgivable. Make better choices or hire someone to do so and step aside. Turn this dumpster fire into the glorious show it is worthy of and still could become, and stop expecting loyalists (lazy brains with rock-bottom expectations) to do so while milking it for money and crutching on desperate watchers pleased for crumbs of an old corpse.

Real acting chops to compete with and match Kelsey's abilities.\n\nIt pains me to say that there is not much redeeming or magical in this facsimile production. Every young actor lacks credible chops, and combined with the less-than-stellar modern, assembly line sitcom writing, it's often hard to watch them deliver without cringe. The firehouse cast is especially hard to watch. (I'm reminded of my church group actors.) \n\nAnd sadly, as is the case with all modern sitcoms, they have ensured that all of the PC boxes were checked, which doesn't \"add,\" it subtracts with the cringey, \"safe\" dialogue that takes no risks and leaves viewers with no rewards. When you make things catering to the few, the masses suffer. \n\nIts utterly forgettable, and I personally wanted so much more for all involved.",

I can't bear Nicholas Lyndhurst in his role as the whiskey-soaked professor. What is it with US comedies adding 1 single British actor for comedic relief? It rarely makes sense that a circle of friends would have 1 random Brit in their group. In this case, he's an old Oxford friend, but did the show really need him?

I like that they have kept the wit, gentle relationship driven humor, and slower paced comedy of the original show, and not fallen into the all too tempting  trap of the 30 second sound bite. This is humor with substance and class, excellent acting, good humored fun, and well worth watching!",

The characters are thin, really thin and Freddy keeps insulting and unfriendly to a character the audience loves so you start to really dislike him. Freddy is completely unrelated to the Spelling Bee Champion and nerd in the older series. Everyone congratulates Kelsey Grammer on a return to character, but its not enough to carry the laggers. Nicholas Lyndhurst has the potential to be funny but the script just isnt what it needs to be to shine. And Niles and Daphne s son is straight out of Saved By The Bell. This is not for grown ups with any kind of intellect. Gutted!",

      "review": "As a Generarion X viewer of the original Frasier, and a fan who watches the reruns weekly, I know this series and its cast well. That being said, I always give a reboot a chance, as a new and separate entity. Unlike other purists, I am looking specifically at the relationship with Freddy and Frasier and this is why my review is unequivocally rotten. Freddy is so unlikable and unrelatable as a character, it is almost as if the writers decided to make him the most one-dimensional jerk that they could, almost a background character. His not attending his grandfather's funeral was the worst decimation possible of his connection to his blue-collar values he shared with him and shows that Freddy is neither working nor upper class. He is instead, a classless shallow, self-centered, garbage human being. If his entire development is predicated upon his love and connection to his grandfather, he would have attended his funeral without hesitation. Whoever wrote that he didn't attend this pivotal ceremony, literally obliterated Freddy as an absolute lost soul and horrible transactional person. His grandfather flew to him for support when he needed him and he doesn't attend his funeral after? I am not familiar with the actor who plays Feddy, but find his performance as interesting and relatable in his role as a robot. His facial expressions are that of an alien who zipped up in a human suit and is attempting to wear it, like the Edgar suit in Men in Black. Yeah, he is that awkward. His unrealistic action of kicking his dad out when he flew in to see him was gross and disturbing on such a level I wanted to literally see someone come and punch him in the face. So he disrespects his grandfather's memory and his father, both who have financially and physically supported him all his life? Who wrote this character? I would recast Freddy immediately with a new actor who is capable of being animated like Niles, Martin and Frasier were. It is both the actor and the character as written who ruin what could be a decent plot. His British colleague and friend is funny and adds dimension and development to the plot. His new Harvard boss has potential, especially the actress playing her, but it is as if someone forcing her to occupy a 90's canned laugh space that is beyond awkward in 2023. Give her more depth for the sake of all women, please!  She has such potential beyond simping to outdo her sister! Did a man write her?  Allow her to have discussion with Frasier that gives the weight and humor we enjoyed between Niles and Frasier please! Also, Niles son is overly written as neurotic to the point you want to ask the writer of his character, really? The roommate with the baby is not a good choice either. The actress is fine, not someone you feel can really have the depth and charisma to carry it past corny jokes though. Replace that actress please. The setting is good, the acceptance of the job by Frasier flimsy, and the attitude that Harvard is so beholden to students liking the professor they turn Frasier's classroom into a version of his Chicago TV show is beyond suspension of belief. Recast Freddy and rewrite him. If you are a writer working on developing his character, you wrote him so poorly it's like watching a choir when that one singer is so off-key, that you cannot give any of your attention to anyone else who is actually doing their job. As per the local hangout bar, the characters feel like a mixup from the 80's, 90's and 2000's and come across as idiots who cannot use any of their grey matter to figure out Fraiser is Freddy's dad. Really? Do the writers hate the audience this much? This feels sullen, grey, sad, angry and absolutely flat to watch. DEVELOP THE CHARACTERS PLEASE and allow them to be human. Stop forcing a 2023 gloss onto this new storyline to the point there feels like there is no hope. Freddy hates pretentious Harvard. Check. He loved his grandfather and wanted a blue-collar job like him, check. Now recast the actor (his face alone makes me want to nope out of this reboot as he has about as much ability to show expressions and emotions as the top layer of left-out-too-long, old school pudding. Also, enough with the terrible trope of \"every parent did me wrong so I am full of hate adult characters\" as all it does is anger parents and make non parents never want to even try. Freddy had the best of everything and every advantage. The best of both classes with his grandfather and father. He could have shown respect to someone for his life most Americans would kill to have experienced. It's not like he grew up poor and without love. His character is so mean and cruel he needs to be on Scared Straight. Anyway, I could have made this as pretentious as the 10 dollar words Frasier uses to his acclaim, but I kept it as sparse and as working-class as a discussion would have been in Cheers, among the locals who inhabited it back then, for you, the writers. Do better and I am going to give this show a chance. You will NEVER change my mind on the horrible casting of Freddy though. Quick, recast before the show has really started and when you do the casting, find a human, who is not an alien zipped up in a Freddy suit.  God, this show has potential. Hey writers, fix what I mentioned and the mediocre could become the  powerful. But hey, I'm just a huge Frasier fan since 1993, and a working stiff, so what do I know? Haha",

That would have put the show over the top. Hopefully he comes back in future seasons if even for an episode.

Both of these reasons were the driving force for me to check out the new show.\n\nBut the fun kinda stops there. The other new cast members are ok, but they're nothing special.  The character of Nile's son is awful through, he's just NOT funny. His jokes aren't funny and his entire character brings absolutely nothing to the show. \n\nI kinda wish they had done better casting for these other characters as they just don't come close to the quality I've expected from Frasier. I watched the Frist 2 epsidoes and I'm not feelin in a hurry to watch the rest personally.\n\nA lot of the jokes are very meh. They feel a bit too PC or something. There's zero edge to any of the jokes and they all seem designed to make sure nobody could possibly find offense to, so you get what you get. Luke warm, safe comedy where nobody gets triggered. \n\nAlthough the show is filmed in front of an audience, it's definitely padded with a laugh track because some of the jokes get a far bigger laugh than they ever deserve, or maybe Americans will just laugh at anything? Who knows. I think I'll stick with British/Irish sitcom's because American sitcom's are dead as disco because Hollywood production now is too terrified of bad PR and or Twitter rants to make genuinely funny or edgy comedy. I think most of the positive review are based on Nostalgia for the original run.",

Why didn't you use a couple of the writers of Frasier??? They were incredible! And Kelsey Grammer could do it again, make people laugh. But with the current writers, he has nothing to work with!!\nThe supporting actors are awful too! Freddy is horrible! He doesn't even seem related to Frasier! He should of been in a career that fit his character more from the Frasier series! He was a lot like Frasier and Lithe. The writers could still have him not get along with Frasier but to be a fireman is so out of his character!!\nI hope this tv series can somehow change things to make sense! Also, why didn't they use the actor who played Freddy as a kid, he was great!\nI think they should use the first two episodes as a bad dream, then when we see Freddy, he actually is employed at a job that fits him better (a educational, professional job) and he can still have issues with his dad.\nAll I know is, if it continues the way its going, I will not watch it.

Watch it bearing that in mind, and hopefully you'll also agree that Frasier is, well, very much still Frasier!.\n\nIf I can encourage anyone to watch it, I'd say it's not so much a \"must see\" but rather a \"should see\".",

I'm not sure how many spoilers I'm about to give, but I'm sure I'll give a few, so be warned\u2026.\n\nFirst, I should say I had sort of low expectations. Based on the trailer and some reviews I already read, as a diehard fan of the original show, I really thought I was in for a disappointment. I was hopeful, but without the original cast, I sort of felt like I was going to see a Paul McCartney concert but expecting to see the \"New Beatles.\" You know\u2026Paul is great, but he's not the same without John, George, and Ringo. Similarly, Kelsey Grammer is great, but he's not the same without David Hyde Pierce, Jane Leeves, Peri Gilpin, and of course, John Mahoney.\n\nThat being said, I was surprisingly very entertained by the new show. I love the dynamic between Frasier and Freddy and it so perfectly mirrors the relationship Frasier had with his father. Also, the \"twist\" of Eve not really being Freddy's girlfriend, and then her having an infant son named JOHN (after John Mahoney, of course, just like how David is named after David Angell) was actually pretty clever. While David was unfortunately a weaker link, I think that's more a result of writing than of Anders Keith's acting. I want to give him a chance, since the role he plays has SUCH tremendous potential. \n\nThe Harvard boss, Olivia, could be interesting, though it's still too early to see what her importance is in this story. And finally, the old friend, Alan, has that dry wit and sense of humor which could turn out to be a great asset. I'm an American, so I didn't really know who Nicholas Lyndhurst was, but he's obviously a very talented comedic actor.\n\nFinally, I LOVED the so-called \"Easter eggs\" and fun references to the original and even to Cheers. David reminding Frasier of both Niles and Daphne; Frasier describing his dad's funeral, and specifically Bulldog singing Ave Maria(?!?!); And even Frasier saying he probably spent too many of his years in Boston in \"a certain bar.\"  But the heart in this show, the father-son relationship, was the heart of the original. As long as they can maintain the style and witty comedic writing, I think it has a lot of potential. I would put those first two episodes on par with an AVERAGE episode from the original series. It was not nearly as good as some of the greats (Dinner Party, Hooping Cranes, The Innkeepers, etc.), but it was certainly better than many of the stinkers. So, if you haven't seen it, you should definitely give it a chance. And if you have, you should still give it a chance to grow into itself. It wasn't perfect, but it has a lot of potential and first episodes are rarely perfect.",

The set up was smart and easy to accept. The humor was full on by the second episode when the show caught its full stride.  The hockey table scene was pure Frasier antics. Poor critics, they just don't get it. The people have spoken with high marks ( 86%), while they, in their withering assessment, could barely rise to a 55%.  I suspect the critics can't relax and enjoy the show for two reasons. 1) Frasier, a man fully comfortable with his tastes and educational pedigree, may be too \"elitist\" for these critics who are so unbelievably out of touch with the people time and time again (and who, no doubt, are proud of  their own discerning tastes and intellectual pedigree). What irony!  2) I suspect, in this time of hyper-socio-political divisiveness and political correctness gone awry, Grammer's politics may stifle their freedom to savor the  warmth, cheekiness and nostalgic sweetness reminiscent of a  less constricting time.  We could once enjoy a show/performer no matter what their personal beliefs; now it's litmus this and litmus that, litmus cancels the yellow cat.

These are the absolute cheapest, bottom-rung F-list actors you can possibly get, if indeed \"actors\" is what they call themselves. They get to deliver their lines in monotone indifference standing next to Kelsey Grammer, and then trip over their own feet while slapping themselves in the face with a pie.\nThe highpoint and ultimate embarrassment of their brief and improvised careers.\n\nIt's worse than a parody. Worse than satire.\nThere is quite a lot of awful tripe in Kelsey \"The Rumble\" Grammer's work the last decades.\n\nA triumphant return to the glory days- this isn't.\nReturn Frasier to the dead.

      "review": "I'm not surprised to see that online critics panned it, but the audience loved it. I'm sure \"top critics\" will be people under 40 who found the laugh track tacky, thought the younger actors \"couldn't keep up,\" or older people who thought new characters were \"annoying\" because they're young. If you're an old fan who watched it and didn't like it, it's because you've changed, not because Frasier has. It's the same premise as the old Frasier, and Grammar hasn't changed a bit. \n\nI'm guessing many people watched 10 minutes of it, groaned, and judged it just on those first 10 minutes. It was awkward in the first 10 minutes. Once it hit its stride, though, it was wonderful. I'll be tuning in to all 10 episodes.\n\nI remember when the original Frasier was out, I was a teen. I hated it. I hadn't gone through a divorce yet in life or experienced adult drama, so I didn't get the humor. I watched it later as a 40-year-old and binged the whole series in a few months. I finally got it. Frasier is something you either get or don't get. It looks like the audience got it but critics didn't. I see that a whole lot these days. Unless it's a silly melodramatic AAA show with music cranked up to 1000 during every episode, they don't get it. It's like reviewers have lost the ability to understand anything that isn't politically charged, dramatic to the point of being silly, or complex to the point of making you feel terrible about yourself and spiraling you into an existential crisis. Have we forgotten simple comedy? Simple anything?\n\nThis is a simple family comedy, and it's a good one. Re-watch it. The humor hasn't changed. You have. Your brain has been tuned to watch comedies in silence. Just the laugh track alone makes some reviewers and even audience reviewers cringe, and that's deeply unfair to shows with good writing like this. I grew up with laugh tracks in my childhood and teens, but when I was 28, they switched to comedies with no laugh tracks. I can remember the silence of some of those early laugh-track-free comedies making me so uncomfortable I couldn't watch them. Modern Family is the first show I watched that didn't have a laugh track, and it made me feel awkward the first year I watched it. Then my brain adapted. Now it's the opposite. I'm used to watching comedies with no live audience laugh track. If you learn to re-tune your brain to accept the laugh track and judge the show on its own merits, it's pretty much Frasier the way it always was.\n\nFrasier is Frasier. His Harvard colleague plays the part of an older Niles. His son takes on the personality of Frasier's father. And the department chair who suckers him into a position at Harvard is Ross. It's the exact same show, and whether reviewers remember or not, Frasier was always about putting quirky, goofy side characters around Kelsey Grammar so that he could make hilarious one-liners. This show succeeds at that.",

The supporting characters of new Fraiser lack screen presence, energy & quite frankly talent, and although Fraiser revives his mannerisms well, again his character's energy has completely diapered too, leaving poorly written, unfunny lines being delivered flat on the floor, along with the show it's self. No one will ever look back on the series, and that sadden's me. \n\nIMO This show should have moved forward, not looked backwards, the whole premise was flawed from the beginning by creating a direction that constricted the writing in a certain direction, trying to recreate characters that emulated past. The idea of Fraiser become a successful TV personality was perfect, why did they not run with that, hosting his own talk show with a whole new direction to take, and new comedy to explore. oh well... at least I'm not being forced to watch it, I will simply pretend new Fraiser does not exist",

Why do we need to remake everything. Other than Frasier himself this is not the same show. In the original you could enjoy the antics of Frasier with his father, brother, and Daphne. I understand that this show is trying to be fresh, but it constantly reminds you of its predecessor. The laugh track is also so insufferable. The new characters are so flat, They are just boring. There is so much more things I could say about this show including the location. Seattle was where Frasier belonged.",

I pity the actor positioned to portray Niles' son.  Few could compare favorably with David Hyde Pierce.  Should there be more seasons (never assume), I hope Pierce re-considers.\n\nI worry about older comedic actors returning to find they had lost their comedic timing, but Kelsey Grammer still very much has his.  I think it's a great show.  The network will probably cancel it ;-)",

As one of Frasier's biggest fans (obviously self-proclaimed) I have big expectations and I have no desire to support a reboot of my favorite show ever unless it's actually well done and true to form. I was not disappointed! It started off slow and took some time to hook me but it felt just as fun, silly, and dry in a good way as the original with enough variation to feel new. No it's not exactly the same but the point of a reboot is to refresh and revitalize an old standard and I think they've done that here. I can't wait for more episodes and I hope they continue to deliver what the fans want.",

While I reminded myself that the original frasier didn't have any of the previous cast members of cheers on as the main cast either (outside of Frasier) I was both excited and apprehensive about this remake. Long story short, the 2 episodes thus far have bested my expectations and have been a joy to watch. If you're looking for the Frasier nostalgia, this hits home.",

The character development had to get the basics out of the way at first I suppose. But with each episode it has gotten better and better.  Episode 4 was just hilarious with David (Niles & Daphne's son) being mistaken for an orphan at the fire dept   Episode 5 feels just like \"old\" Frasier in the best possible ways and we belly laughed throughout the episode. It's pretty remarkable that he (Kelsey) can still channel the character and still be as funny as he ever was. Some ask if this needed to be made... And I think you can say that about hundreds of shows these days, but this one is a gem and deserved a shot at a revival.  So happy they did.  I think they are hitting the stride.  Lovin' it!",
