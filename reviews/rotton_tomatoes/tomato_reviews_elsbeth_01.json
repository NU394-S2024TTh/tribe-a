I would lean toward murder/mystery but it isn't really.  There is a murder, but there is no mystery.  The audience knows who killed the victim and then waits around to see how Elsbeth figures it out.  I'm sure the writers think this is clever, but is it really?  It seems like a waste of a lot of talented people on writing that is, at best, mediocre.",

For me, I like to watch a cop show not knowing the who\u2019s guilty. That\u2019 ruined bec Elsbeth knows the guilty party by looking at them and does her quirky bit to annoy them into being caught. I say annoying because that\u2019s how I feel when watching and why I turned off the episode abt the plastic surgeon. She wasn\u2019t upset so it equaled quilty. ANNOYING.",

There could be shows where the real author of a surprise, but it would be complicated for a show where the real mistery is what or who is she investigating in the NYPD, and that is revealed  slowly. We are only look at the Captain, but there are other characters that could emerge that she could be investigating. People who are focusing and critizing that the author of the episode's crime fail to see that the real mistery is what is she investigating, right now we think that he is only investigating the Captain, but the season is young. I like the show, and the dialog and the characters are well defined, well written, and the Elsbeth character is beautifully performed.",

I imagine her to be an adult version of Beverly Clearly\u2019s Ramona, who has found a way to channel her mischievousness into a unique & successful professional calling.  Each episode delivers a cat & mouse challenge for Elsbeth to wrangle a perpetrator to justice, while protecting the wrongly accused. It is known from the onset who the guilty party is; the delight comes from the central character\u2019s over the top personality, manner, fashion choices & deceptively innocent and enthusiastic approach to sleuthing.  The casting is excellent. The writing is simultaneously savvy & whacky.  I look forward to each episode for a delightful opportunity to experience intelligent and empathetic silliness.

Throw in that they can at least develop a character like, uh, oh, the incomparable Castle comes to mind.  I realize most network murder mystery shows over the years can be predictable; I mean how many Mentalist's, Angela's and Monk's can one have:) This show however, is so forced and obvious that it has become unwatchable; after only 5 episodes!  Why you ask? Hmm, is it knowing the killer at the beginning? Nope; been done before. Is it the amazing and inquisitive mind of Elsbeth? Definitely not! I can write her entire script 5 minutes in. Is it entertaining?? Marginal. I lasted 5 episodes, but I and the show quickly  ran out of intelligence, writing skills and characters I like! Piece out folks.",
