The costumes look cheap and the dialogue is flat. They gave Picard some kind of sad childhood backstory that we've never heard of and it felt forced.\n\nThe worst thing, though, is the laziness of the writing:\n[Begin Spoilers] They massively retcon one of the most consistent details in Star Trek (how Borg assimilation works) just so characters could steal information from the Borg queen, then later in the season it's revealed off-handedly that the ship they've been on (with the Borg queen) can just replicate anyone who has ever been aboard as a hologram with all of that person's skills, personality and knowledge. They could have just gotten the info from the ship's reconstruction of the Borg queen without the nonsense retcon! Nevermind how overpowered a ship with that capability would be going forward.\n[End Spoilers]\n\nI'd say take a pass on this season. If you're a Trekkie, it'll just make you mad.",

In the middle of the season there are like 3 or 4 episodes where it is like the second half of one episode and the first half of the next is making a true episode. Like the end cut come to late or to early, depending on how you look at it. Still, it is enjoyable as a Star trek fan as it has a lot of connections to pas series especially TOS and TNG. And it leaves a lot of questions to answer in the future of Star Trek, like what is that transwarp hub opening, what will happen with the Jurati-collective,I want to know more about the Travelers and the Supervisors ... And with all the frustrations of the season there are 4 really amazing episodes, and the hug between JL and Q at the end is precious. So yeah, watch it, and even binge-watch it if you can because it is better that way.",

As we see familiar faces, it's a bittersweet reminder of what the series could've been from the outset, considering its titular character. Though the use of legacy characters brings a certain warmth, it still feels like a delayed satisfaction, a reaction rather than a planned narrative choice. The core issue remains: the essence of Star Trek's character-driven storytelling feels conspicuously absent. The looming shadow of Alex Kurtzman's influence continues to be felt, much to the chagrin of longtime Trek fans.",

      "review": "While some writing decisions left me wondering what the showrunners were thinking (Too many unnecessary mini plots), overall this is a good series, and it's very underrated by some fans. For those feeling that it's not classic Trek, you're right, it isn't. Every era of Star Trek has felt different as they reflect the times they're made in. Compare the latter episodes of The Next Generation era with the original Kirk movies and they feel totally different in character and atmosphere. And those movies feel totally different to the original episodes of Star Trek, such as The Cage. On top of that, every series of Star Trek after the original (including TNG) has met with fans dumping on them and saying they don't feel like Star Trek. Fans said TNG wasn't Trek because it was a different crew. DS9 wasn't Trek because it was on a station instead of a ship. And I remember fans who couldn't stand Janeway at first. And don't get me started on how underappreciative fans were of Enterprise. But if you can accept that a new series of Star Trek will have a unique feel, and try new things, especially seeing as Picard is set in a new era, over 20 years after the events of Nemesis, you might hopefully appreciate what this show does right. It's very faithful to the lore of it's universe and covers a lot of ground in showing how the politics of the various galactic factions have evolved or changed, for better or worse. Most importantly, Picard is still Picard, an altruistic but stubborn diplomat who maintains optimism and ethics in the face of more cynical forces.",

For those of you who want your Star Trek without space, Starfleet, the Federation or in the future; and desperatey want your Star Trek on Earth, in the now times, in the United States (because Federation now means Earth and Earth now means USA), can never get enough of beating the dead horse of the convoluted Soong family tree where every Soong from every generation looks like a Data clone, and loves internal flashbacks set in an Earth-bound historical dreamscape--will LOVE this season. These people have no clue what good scifi is. They have removed it of its science, its speculative and educational aspects and the endless wonder and fear of outer space. Instead they have turned Star Trek into just another mediocre action series. And this is coming from someone whose favourite Trek caharcter of all time is PICARD!",

All the horrible characters introduced in season 1 are back and they have been turned up to 11. The writers do things with established characters like Q, that will disgust you. Honestly these writers didn't earn the right to mess with the canon like this. This season should be stricken from the record and Paramount should say it is not canon!",

No no no, this doesn't work! They've totally jumped the shark!!\n\nBut, then things started to happen. The gang got back together. The story took off & Stewart didn't have to be the evil monster, (although he did do a decent job of being aggressive & loud once or twice). The story evolved, went different ways, then came back together. More characters were added, friends from the past, but not gratuitously, rather the storyline was enhanced by their presence.  We were thrilled to see them, & they fit in the story.\n\nEach cast member has their strengths and they're put to use beautifully in both scripting & acting. The overall plot is brilliant, the plot & pace is perfect & it makes you want to watch every second of these 10 shows, even watch them again. It ramped up the tension & excitement in every episode right to the end. We wanted to binge watch it in one night!

Sure it's nice to see Q & Picard reunited and Q messing with Picard's mind, but sadly the writers of this series have turned Star Trek into a sad parody of itself. Sure it's clever to tap into all the nostalgia and pick off the popular bad guys as a core to the story but I'm pretty sure all this has been seen before on Star Trek Next Generation. Smash together STTNG First Contact with STTHG Best Of Both Worlds, add a lost memory that gets way too much airtime and reflections and you have Picard S2. Back in the 90's this story could have been a tightly told \u2018classic' double episode of STTHG, but all we seem to get now is shows produced to milk out watch times on streaming platforms. If this show was serious and understood the fear factor of Q they would have had John De Lancie seen always as the un aged Q and that would have really added a visual shock to the story. Considering the powers of the Q in the story folk lore it just feels like the writers & producers don't understand what's important to focus on and what's important to drop. What was really obvious was how so much of this season is milked with slow & repeated storytelling yet the final episode is like a sprint to the finish line. And once you get to the end you wished you had never started the race. The ending was weak, pointless and lacked anything to say it was an important story to tell.",

It's also hard to reconcile Q's plan to stop Renee with his ultimate goal to help Picard.  They perhaps could have explained that more.  How is Dr. Soong able to create Data, or Lore, 400 years later?  Why does Data eventually build twin robots who look just like the girl created by Dr. Soong?  Was Will Wheaton's appearance at all necessary or even interesting?  Are they going to revisit Kahn?  It is extraordinarily convenient that Dr. Soong apparently creates Kahn, who would be Data's other brother?\n\nWhy does Jerati as the Borg Queen tell Picard to look up in Ep 1?  \n\nThe entire season, in a nutshell, is Q helping Picard deal with the trauma of his mother's suicide.  That's a hard one.  I dont know if it lifts the season or drags it down. The scenes with his mother certainly are a drag and you know almost from the onset, when they introduce her, where it's heading.  It's still very disturbing to see and I'd rather them have not shown us her final act.  It's not really why people turn to Star Trek.  However, due to the decades associated with the character, it is arguably acceptable.  S3 is coming, I hope it's a good send off for the SNG crew.",

It really makes me sad that this is what we're doing to all our beloved characters.  Our old heroes.  They are relegated to worthless old junk tossed away into space.",

Far too much of Picard \"haunted by his past\" or delivering \"inspirational and heartwarming speeches,\" rather than solving problems in clever and authoritative TNG style. No, what we have here is just lazy by-the-numbers storywriting. \n\nSelf-indulgent leftwing political talking points delivered in patronising, non-artistic style. \n\nEvery TNG reference and character feels derivative and misplaced. Every new character seems a misfit in the Star Trek canon. Contrived and dull (Elnor). Completely Un-Starfleet-worthy (Rios, Raffie). Unfunny comic relief (Jurati). Laris is a little more interesting and likeable, but what is an Irish Romulan doing as Picard's house maid? It makes no sense at all. \n\nI'm torn. Plod on to see the cast reunion in series three?

The series starts in France, where Picard is breeding wines like an idiot, exposing the vine bottles to the sun. When the script is written by uneducated people, that's what you get... Afterward, we see him as a young boy with a Basque beret. To complete the caricature, he lacks a baguette under his arm. The French don't wear Basque berets since the 30s, but the stupid scriptwriters had to find pictures on the internet to see what a Frenchman looks like. It's slow, it doesn't move at a sci-fi pace. We left the series in the hands of a failed artist who thinks he's doing melodrama? Twenty minutes have passed since the beginning. And to say what: NOTHING. Nothing but nonsensical chatter that ends with a parody of a speech at the Academy...\nEpisode 2 has more movement and seems to go somewhere to understand that Q, with an incomprehensible speech, enters the scene to give a lesson to Picard! Why him? We don't know because Q's speech is gibberish...\nEpisode 3 is even more confusing. The bad writers seem to discover the upcoming scenes on the fly. Even Picard and 7-of-9 don't know where they are any more. Classic conflict situations with the team doubting while Picard seems defeated and accepting a fate in the hands of the Borg Queen. They are led by the Queen to 2024. Why? You don't want to ask those kinds of questions, apparently. The writers are improvising with patches from other Star Trek series. One wonders if the script is written by AI putting together cuts from old episodes?\nBefore, this kind of story was done for one episode, while here the background is diluted over several episodes. It's boring and sometimes caricatural. When the goal is only commercial, Gene Roddenberry must be turning in his grave. The son does not make the weight. The nature sometimes rests...",

We come for the storylines and plot development. Buy we get Stewart acting as an inept lost old man. Who some how has a fresh new android body. When he's not having a flashback he's experiencing full blown lapses in judgment. \nMale characters take a back seat the their female counterparts. They are sub plots and after thoughts. \nMen are treated as weak overly emotional useless back seat characters. Women as portrayed in a way that make men look stupid. They are in control the entire season and the season feels forced and gross. \n\nThe writing is terrible, the CGI is terrible. The acting is terrible.\nThis is the worst season of Trek existence. \nGene Roddenberry is rolling in his grave.",

After the ends credits rolled, I'd have settled for adequacy as much as one lost in the desert would settle for finding a bottle of water with the cap off.\n\n     It's a shameful insult to acting, producing, writing, thinking, business, and creativity. It's a cruelly ignorant display of mediocrity foisted upon us by three generations of protected yet talentless film-makers who, after two years of flailing first drafts put to screen, instead of the recycle bin, were still unable tell us a good story.\n\n     The only take away one gains from watching Picard is that those involved would make a better and more meaningful impact on the world if they were being dropped into the Black Sea as mine clearers rather than be allowed to ever be involved in any aspect of story-telling ever again.\n\n     It's dolorously and childishly wretched to the point it actually ruins the memory of prior accomplishments of talented people who aren't involved and sullied the good name of those who were dragged back in.",

It so reminded me of the bad holodeck episodes that spanned a couple of episodes where the cast are trapped in another reality and must unify to get out. The problem was that after seven or eight episodes, I came to realize that we were trapped in that holodeck as well.\n\nI don't know who constructed this story, but they really need to rewatch the original shows, all of them. There were so many inconsistencies within the canon and gaps within it's own story.\n\n[SPOILERS]\n* When did Guinan and Picard first meet? For Guinan, it was 19th century San Francisco (in Time's Arrow). This is part of Picard's history (ST:TNG preceded ST:Picard). So it should have been more of a reunion in 2024 LA. Don't get me started on recasting the character when you have Whoopi.\n* What is the origin of the name 10 Forward?  Apparently, it's from a bar in 2024.  It just happens to be the same name as the lounge located in the forward section of the 10th deck of a starship constructed many centuries later, and one that will be run by the same woman.  What a cosmic coincidence!\n* What happened to Robert Picard, Jean-Luc's older brother?  He should have been somewhere in all those endless and rather pointless flashback scenes.  It would have really given the background to his resentment of Jean-Luc as seen in Season 4 of TNG.\n* Why did they cast, for the role of Picard's father, an actor that looks strikingly similar to (a somewhat chunkier version of) Alexander Siddig, the actor who played Dr. Bashir on Deep Space 9, and then introduce the character as a Starfleet doctor?\n* Why does every generation of Dr. Soong's look exactly the same?  (This is also a gap in Trek Canon.)  And why do these different Dr. Soong's create entities that look exactly the same?  This would be like creating something that matches exactly what one of your ancestors created back in the 17th century.\n* Khan was created in the late 20th century, and yet 25 years later, he's back on the drawing board?\n* Wouldn't a 21st century altruistic Borg allowed to grow for centuries have radically altered the entire Trek canon?\n\nI could go on and on about other problems with the show (e.g., wasting the talents of Michelle Hurd and Jeri Ryan by having them bicker throughout the entire run).  This show needs to be tightened up.  It really needs its own Dave Filoni [of current Star Wars] or Kevin Fiege [Marvel].  Both men are experts on their own brands.  Both men have a firm grasp on the history of each universe (and I'm willing to forgive small infractions).  Both men know the canon.  Both men know their audiences.  I don't think that the creators of Picard understand any of that.\n\nWe also watched the first episode of Strange New Worlds, and that is showing promise.",

Second season Picard was just the opposite. After each episode I sat there thinking \"I have no idea what's going on.\" To me, season 2 boils down to amateur story development and writing and the need to be woke.\n\nAt its core TNG presented the message that people have flaws and perhaps bad things happened to them or they did things in past that were not good. However, people used these experiences to become a stronger and better person. See the TNG episodes \"Tapestry\" and \"The Inner Light.\" That is inspirational story telling.\n\nPicard season 2 is just the opposite: every bad thing that happens to people makes them weaker, broken and resentful.\n\nThen we have the woke card. Season 1 Picard was acceptable while season 2 took wokeness to a whole new level. While nothing compares to ST Discovery for woke gone amok it seems the Picard writers wanted to address their woke items. That's why the story lines and characters are so completely disjointed throughout the whole season 2:  Bring in a character and/or story line to address my woke item and then discard that thread and move onto the next woke item. \n\nAnd then there's the Borg queen assimilating all these species because she was lonely deep inside? What?? Evil people kill people for power and control over others. That is their nature.\n\nWe'll see what season 3 brings.

Picard is entitled to his childhood traumas but I can't say they were particularly compelling being spread out over an entire season that took place on present day earth with almost no Star Trek to be found. Think Star Trek: First Contact minus all the cool parts. The finale introduced some fun new Trek ideas and was emotionally satisfying for the most part. All in all I expected more from a series named after our most iconic captain. I guess this is the best we can hope for with Discovery setting the bar so low.",

      "review": "I have been a Star Trek fan for over 25 years, and enjoy watching reruns of TOS, TNG, DS9, Voyager, and Enterprise. They never get old, and teach important lessons about acceptance, tolerance, compassion, and a myriad of other positive characteristics and attributes. I have been enjoying Discovery as well. While the first season of Picard was interesting and has some promise, moving the character of Picard forward, season 2 turned out to be a utter disaster that has permanently tarnished Star Trek and Jean-Luc Picard. What can be gleaned from the season is that Picard had a traumatic childhood and that psychology in the 24th century has apparently reverted 500 years. His father, a Starfleet Commander, locked his mentally ill mother away in a room to \"help keep her from hurting herself.\" Picard unlocked the door and she subsequently hung herself. I guess the mild melds Picard has been through didn't dredge that memory up, huh? What a bleak future to look forward to where psychological illnesses still have devastating ramifications. Was this character growth, or character assassination? The latter seems to be more justifiable, as Jean-Luc already had deeply emotional and meaningful experiences explicated throughout all of TNG and likewise in his past. Why does Picard have to relive these experiences? Well, Q is dying and wants to take Picard on another journey through space and time to \"help\" him. Because that's what Q has been all about apparently, helping Picard and humanity. Gee, that Borg introduction and subsequent assimilation of Jean-Luc sure didn't seem like much help to me. The season made a mockery of Q and the plotline of him \"dying alone\" made absolutely zero sense. Where is the Continuum? His son? Miss Q? Nothing is explained, other than Q is lonely and wanted to see Picard because he is his \"favorite.\" You can't make this garbage up. It would seem like a parody, if it wasn't the unfortunate reality and canonical truth. \n\nOh, by the way, Wil Wheaton shows up in the last episode to whisk Kore off to become a Traveler. While his appearance and the connection established between the Travelers and Supervisors/Watchers wasn't unwelcomed, it didn't make much sense plot-wise. How did Kore merit becoming a traveler? Wil Wheaton's performance was that of giddy kid who was just happy to be there, and regrettably it shows. There was also a lost opportunity to have an interesting conversation between Q, Picard, and Traveler Crusher after Q's dramatic and doubtable explanation behind his motivations. \n\nThe relationship between Seven and Raffi doesn't make any sense, and seems like a clear mismatch. There is no chemistry between these characters, and the straining to make a meaningful connection culminates in a kiss that is unbelievable. Seven was seen as a sex symbol on Voyager and there were calls against this sexist and stereotypic portrayal of women then. I guess she retains her sex symbol status, only now she has to appeal to the incels who love lesbians but hate gay men. The only redeeming quality to this season was the Jurati/Borg (Borgati) storyline. The Borg becoming part of the Federation is really interesting and fantastic twist to an established archenemy. \n\nAll in all, the entire season felt as if each episode was revealing a tiny portion of the overall plot, and that little to nothing made sense or was properly explained until episode 9 or 10. The entire season can be treated as a prelude to season 3, where we will undoubtedly be subjected to continuous plot teases until the penultimate, or last, episode. Patrick Stewart needs to listen to his fans, as I'm certain he has a good deal of sway over a show named after his character. This \"love letter\" to Picard and Stewart is akin to the \"love letter\" Star Trek Enterprise was given in its finale (holographic) episode. It is an insult to Star Trek, a major blemish on Stewart's amazing acting career, and the complete character assassination of a beloved icon in sci-fi. If you're a Star Trek fan, this season will make you simultaneously sad and angry.",

      "review": "Too unfocused for its own thematic ambitions! The story does not take its time for any of its themes. And there is too much unnecessary cruel and graphic scenes- not whatchable with children!\n\nWhen I watched Star Trek Picard I had the impression that the story is trying to include many important themes but does not spend enough time for them and hence feels convoluted. It feels rushed and unfocused. Often I had the impression that dramatic scenes did not have sufficient setup by the story, and dialog was full of vague metaphors and truisms and the mysteries were not original and only superficially meaningful. That left the taste of shallowness. The heroes I grew up with from TOS TNG DS9 and VOY now are depicted troubled and deeply traumatized. Nevertheless, they will always remain my symbolic and idealized fix-points of measured, differentiated, tolerant, brave, positive human behavior - nobody can take this from me, not even ST Picard. Additionally there where a lot of deeply disturbing unnecessary cruel scenes. You cannot watch this show with children.\nThe actors do their best with what is given to them.\nThe art of allegorical science-fiction stories with thought provoking dilemmas that tells something about the human condition is lost in Star Trek Picard\n\n The story does not take its time for any of its themes. \n\nThemes like. Climate change, racism, totalitarianism, freedom of love, personal responsibility, exploitation and enslavement and marginalisation of social groups, migration because of war or natural catastrophies, artificial intelligence - they are all mentioned and shortly shown, but they do not become the core of the story - the themes the story is about. \n\nSeason 2 seems to spend some time on childhood trauma and depression.\n\t And yes depression can be debilitating and can occur with highly intelligent people like Rene Picard but you don't solve that with the sentence that there is always some hope and light - thats to superficial, I am sorry. I mean thats not enough to tell a story about depression. Then the Picards childhood trauma - the whole premise is that the childhood trauma makes you stuck in your past- ok but than pleas show Picard being stuck in the past. Establish and show that he can not make decisions and relationships because he always thinks about his past and is followed by it step by step. This is nether shown in TNG nor in \"Picard\". It is not even established in the very short scene establishing his love story. No indication. \nHis love story is so shortly shown, I am sorry but there is no love story told, its just a scene showing 2 people that might have some connection and maybe some love potential but not more. \nAnd yes accepting who you are, and accepting your childhood trauma, process it emotionally is the key, in my opinion, but Iam sorry the story could have and should have focused more on that, because this gift by Q and that selfe revelation by Picard are the driving core of the Story. \nWhy let Q create a dystopian future with galactic wide suffering? Is it really all about getting Picard hit by a car so that he falls into a coma so that a Romulan watcher can go into his mind? The whole side plots are unnecessary, so that the childhood trauma story feels rushed and does not give more than the bare minimum about that topic. And there so many unnecessarily cruel and graphic scenes in season one and two. \n\nI try to boil the Story down to its core to give some context for my reasoning I will not look at the abundance of story incoherences here it will be about the actual Story premises:\nWarning Spoilers....!\n\nSeason 1: basically: Masseffect\n\n1. Picard faces his Borg-trauma again, but no new character revelation given. Picard is the same. At the end it seems all Borg on the defect ship are either dead or floating in space.\n\n2. Picard seems to feel responsible and guilty for the bad living conditions of the Romulan refugees and that he was not able to rescue all of them. But no character revelation is given to him at the end.The living conditions of the Romulan refuges did not change at the end.\n\n3. Picard convinces the oppressed synths not to kill all intelligent biological life in the galaxy by telling them that giving biological life a chance and forgiveness is the better choice than taking revenge and committing genocide (basically a truism). The future of the synths, how they will fit into the galactic community, is not described. Picard himself becomes a synth at the end. Whether this has impact on his self-perception, his point of view, how other see him, whether he is now marginalized as well, or any implication regarding his traumatic past of being partially synthetic as a Borg - no consequence no revelation is given.\n\n4. The secret Romulan association was basically right in their premise but act and get treated as simplistic villains - they simply disappear \u2013 no consequences no commentary on the choice of not destroying all biological life by the synths, no revelation given to the Romulans\u2026\n\nSeason 2: A Christmas carol and the episode Tapestry from TNG \n\nWhat happens and What does Q want? \nIt turns out, Q creates an nightmarish, dystopian, galaxy impacting alternate future with allot of galaxy-wide suffering so that Picard decides to time-travel into the past, so that he can get hit by a car and fall into a coma, so that a Romulan agent, that looks like the Romulan housekeeper Picard is in love with, can go into his mind and help Picard face his childhood trauma in order to accept it as a part of himself - absolve himself and tell his housekeeper about his love for her and not die alone. That is the gift Q gives Picard, because Q is dying, and he thinks alone. People die and suffer (basically the entire galaxy and the protagonists) during that story, and none of it is necessary to create that situation that Picard faces and accepts his childhood trauma. \nQ could have done it much more easy. besides- would the Borg Queen not know about Picard Trauma? It is a lost chance to make the Borg queen make picard remember and cope with his childhood trauma so that picard at the same time learns to truely forgive the borg and solve his Borg trauma aswell finally.\n\nWhat impact does it have on the characters? \nPicard- It is not evident how this changes Picard \u2013 it is told but not actually shown by choices he makes. Picard was already capable to connect to people or love them or make friends before but maybe not to stay with them you could argue- is this specifically shown in \"Picard\"- NO- \nHe decides to not prevent his own childhood trauma- but also not to prevent his mothers suicide. Regarding the role Captain Picard in TNG has in history, risking that by changing his own past would be an act of absurd selfishness for Picard, on the other hand does Picard now actually become guilty of letting his mother commit suicide knowing  that he as a grown man decided it? What is Picard take on it? This kind of dilemma, so easy to solve it seems, is not even handled by the story. Does he behave now differntly in the end? No. Does Picard being a Synth have impact on the Story (I mean the story not the plot) - NO \n\nElenor: dies at the beginning and comes back to life in the end- no growth \n\nRaffi and 7of 9: They have a relationship with little disputes from beginning to end: no development \n\nDr Jurati: she becomes more self-confident and finds a purpose in life -- kind of...But its not actually a self-revelation by the story- basically , she is brilliant but socially inhibited \u2013 so she becomes the new borg queen \u2013 is never alone again and creates an benevolent Borg collective. Ok why not. But to does this mean Picard and Seven did not get assimilated by the Borg? Or similarly: would Picard have prevented his own childhood trauma by throwing the key away? Yes or no? But that seems just symbolic for him and woud have changed nothing in his timeline. \n\nCaptain Rios: He is Captain at the beginning - maybe a step for him? No reflection by him given. Then he falls in love and stays in the past and his doings during the rest of his life become an important part why our future becomes \"good\"- does he not care for the timeline or is he just assuming that his doings are ment to be? What is his revelation? He needed and wanted to care for people in a more social way and have a family- that\u00b4s good but why could he not find it in his time?\n\n Q- gets a hug while he is dying by Picard and therefore doesn't die alone. Q `s revelation: he is not alone because Picard is there. - Really? Thats it? (Didn't Q have a family as seen in VOY?) \n\nWhat is the moral argument about our society/human condition how I interpret the story of Picard? \n\nChildhood trauma can cause you to do good things but hunts you in the end and inhibits you nevertheless, so that you have to accept yourselves entirely to find peace with yourself to be able to truely connect to people. \nI don't see Picard being changed in the last episode- it is just implied that he is changed. Climate change and racism are terrible, and we will destroy our future if we don't solve them. And it depends on who solves these problems what kind of future we will have- because the story tells that if bad people solve the problem the future will be totalitarian and if good people solve the problems - the future becomes good.- The story doesn't tell about the differences of their means both seem to be connected to technology and some kind of social movement. At least thats how I interpret that storyline. \n\nCaptain Picard, in my opinion, was never meant to be a real whole character \u2014 as the federation was never described or meant to be in detail a real possible future form of society \u2014 they are symbols playing their part in a series of allegorical stories about us. Star Trek in its core (doesn't mean it can not diverge from that formula for a while of course) is not about Picard or Q or Data or the Enterprise, Romulans .... They are all figurative symbols. The symbol of Captain Picard will always represent for me that kind of measured, differentiated, patient and decisive, intellectual, enlightened behavior I admire. The series \"Picard\" did not add anything for me to that. Captain Picard of TNG- Thats the symbol I look up to. \n\nFurther Thoughts:\n\nClassic Star Trek handles one or two themes in one episode by contrasting an idealized version of human future and idealized internally almost non-conflicted Protagonists against a symbolic/metaphorical depiction of current human problems as alien cultures or other kinds of fictional what if scenarios. The topic at hand is on one hand presented by the view of the aliens or a certain aspect of the scenario and the protagonist's idealistic view on the other hand. Because both points of views are depicted as equally strong in argumentation and validation a dilemma is described. Overall it is an Allegory of a current existing mostly social dilemma and of a measured handling of that thematic because the idealistic protagonists aim at solving the problem in dialogs and scientific measures and hold violent action as a last resort. The ideal Storyworld and main Characters do not serve as realistic depictions and do not develop and serve more like rhetorical foils for contrast and catalysts for dialog and change in the allegorical dilemma they encounter.\nIn later iterations of ST the allegorical dilemmas are more created using the storyworld so that a many episodes overarching season-structure of the story is possible. By this it possible to tell stories about the inherent limits of that idealized version of human future and there fore making the protagonists more human with weaknesses, wants and needs themselves rather then the aliens or the what if situation. This development in ST mirrors the overall development in TV/streaming series to an overarching structure (GOTH, BB), unfortunately ST did not wholeheartedly implement the overarching story-structure that become popular.\nThe Reboot era of ST marks a total shift towards that structure. Story world and protagonists are not anymore depicted as idealized, idealistic, internally non-conflicted and barely developing to not idealized, mostly non-idealistic, and in almost every case internally deeply conflicted. The problem lays in the development of the characters and the story-world. In order for character and world development, the protagonists have to make character revealing decisions, the more difficult the more revealing. In order to do that the depiction of their struggle with the given dilemma and of course, the dilemma itself has to be shown by the story. Unfortunately, the given problems are mostly described in exposition and less shown and foremost in unequal depiction hence the ambiguous nature of the problem- hence a dilemma is not shown. Problems are solved without real inconveniences for the characters and predominantly by simple overpowering of the obstacle. It is a shift from an allegorical story focusing on the depiction of a dilemma as the core of that story to plot focusing on fast and conveniently easy overcoming of action heavy obstacles and just mentioning themes by exposition or by far too short situations, hence decisions and therefore actions do not serve a function in the story-structure but rather as necessary for the plot. Therefore seemingly difficult decisions do not feel deeply revealing because the situation is not organically developed and depicted in a differentiated way but just enabled. Without deeply felt revealing decisions the depicted character developments seem shallow and forced to just happen, despite the dramatic dialog and acting that give their best to make believe that you are watching a story-driven drama that handles relevant current topics -  instead of what is actually happening: a convoluted unfocused story trying to include all today's relevant topics but giving none of them the time or differentiated handling they need and deserve. Many dramatic situations appear without necessary setup and mystery setups without original payoffs. Where classic ST characters were by story-design two-dimensional to serve their function in the allegory, reboot ST characters, the ones that existed before and the new ones, all get traumatic/abusive backgrounds with guilt and addictions and hence denying in hind-side their rhetorical function as fictional symbols of the idealized human potential of every individual human and society, and therefore their function as positive symbolic fix-points in a broader narrative sense and on a very personal level for many classic ST fans. Where lassic ST stood out as a positive, utopian and you might say naive approach to the future when all other where rather dystopian, thus giving a unique comment in the frame of discussing the future, reboot ST follows the trends made by others denies that or any other original approach. Where classic ST is watchable with the entire family, reboot ST is filled with disturbing unnecessarily directly graphically depicted cruel and brutal scenes. Where classic ST presented often preachy arguments but thought provoking dilemmas aswell, reboot ST presents truisms and vague metaphors and still preachy arguments. Where classic ST focuses on a wide range of aspects of the human condition and in its capacity as science-fiction often on the relation between humans and technology in an allegorical and mostly episodic way in the core of the story, the ST Reboot claims to handle a lot but focuses on nothing.\n\nThanks for reading!",

      "review": "A brilliant season that was both deeply insightful as a character study (Picard as a damaged soul) and in the grander societal concepts (wealth/class division in the near future with potential fascist implications). Unfortunately, both of these can be very touchy issues for many people who will feel defensive a great man they admire being shown to also be broken or who want to turn a blind eye to the social issues of the day and seek distraction from them rather than engagement in a conversation about them. Throw in a small amount of non-majority representation and you can imagine how the fragile egos are going to rant and rave and rail against any and every aspect of the show, which can distract from the brilliance I mentioned at the beginning of this review. My advice: if you're a Trek fan, particularly a fan of Picard as a character, then binge the show, get your thoughts together about it, and come leave a review yourself before you read a single other opinion (not that mine should be the last by any merit, but unlike Picard I can't turn back time and here we are).

The Serialized format is a bit different than the prior episodic one - but I enjoyed that it included Q, Guinan, the Borg and time travel. I find the characters interesting, and appreciate that they have flaws and struggle with various things.  Star trek has always had plot holes and inconsistencies, and often some complex situation tied up just a little too neatly at the end of an episode.  I don't care!  It can be a bit preachy at times - but that goes back to the beginning of Star Trek, and Roddenberry openly spoke about being able to address issues of the day by placing it in a Sci-fi setting, that would not have gotten past the TV Censors of the 60's.

It's a gross miscalculation of the audience's expectation that has resulted in actualised damage to the brand as fans just give up and walk away, not just from this series, but from the franchise as a whole. It's insulting to the target audience's intelligence that the showrunners believed this would be acceptable, much less to be praised for their incompetence. \nIt's artistic presentation is completely unremarkable with none of the hallmarks of Star Trek. Instead the viewer is presented with run of the mill bad Sci-Fi that neither has any link to science, or believable fiction. \nThe characters are frustratingly unbelievable and poorly written, making childish behavioural decisions which break the fourth wall with their stupidity. It's abundantly clear that the writers and producers have told the Star Trek alumni cast to completely alter their characters to such disastrous extent that they bear no resemblance whatsoever to the characters they claim to be beyond the actor's faces. \nNot a scene goes by that doesn't invoke a facepalm of despair when the viewer is reminded they are more intelligent and knowledgeable than the writers and producers. \"Star Trek\" Picard has made it very clear to me that it's absolutely possible to fall out of love with something that previously felt it would last a lifetime. \n\nYou've killed Star Trek for me, and from what I can tell I'm in the majority. In fact, I don't know of anyone who has seen this \"Star Trek\" Picard production as anything other than catastrophic to their enjoyment of everything that came before.

They were trained and acted with intention. This entire version of starfleet and every character is rash and impulsive and selfish. It's like watching a 27 year old guy who didn't mature beyond his frat days pretend he was a star fleet officer. It's very strange. .  I know much has been made of the language but it seems like that is purely a problem stemming from the type of person who is written. A adult adolescent.  Even beyond the tone of the characters there are so many off issues. Like just head scratching moments.\nCharacters introduced who do not act in any sort of consistent manner. \nThere are several points in the second season that just blatantly contradict the first season for instance a former Borg character says that they were not allowed to join starfleet because they were former Borg. But... That's after being introduced to a Borg, who clearly was in star fleet hence the uniform, in the first season. \n\nOr things like ancestors or descendants looking exactly like their eventual grandchildren/grandparents.\n Which... Is fine I guess.  But when they go out of their way to show that previous character dying or being able to have kids etc etc... So ... How could they have had kids? They died so they wouldn't have had descendants and that was after stating they had been doing this one thing for their entire life. It's that sort of thing. It's not exactly knit picking because it's everywhere. Like walking barefoot on Lego's Just lots of inconveniences . And thats ignoring the retconning that's done for all our characters. Such as Picard apparently never having a love story before ... When he did?   I think B Crusher would be pretty upset to hear that.\n\nOr him having no idea what it was like to have kids? When he had the experiences of an entire life with a wife and children on tng. And that's a very character defining moment on that show.  Like that episode grows the character. Also I think they forgot that Picard had a brother. Or that his father was also bald?  It's just... Like... I don't understand. These aren't super deep cuts. But basic continuity issues.  \n...\nIt's very odd is the best I can say. It's like watching Babylon 5 or any other random sci-fi show except it is set in star trek clothes. But it doesn't act like start trek. These aren't more civilized or any better than today. In fact there is lots of poverty and drug addiction and crime and everything else that the other shows specifically said they had gotten rid of. . \nOh and vaccines. Yes vaccines get brought up. How they have vaccine chips. And identity chips. ...\nSo... What? Wait now in the future we haven't gotten rid of these things but rather everyone is chipped like a dog? Ugh. It's just so strange. . \nI've not disliked a show is such a long time. And worst of all I was really ready to accept even mediocre work. But this makes enterprise looks like a brilliant show.

He doesn't seem to have cared if the great actor had lost his critical faculties, he apparently allowed anything to be filmed that would get the signature on a piece of paper. He knew the usual nodding dog critics would nod it through rotten tomatoes as long as he included 'the right' messaging and as long as he did it regularly enough and bluntly enough that it could be picked up while the critics were watching their review copies on fast forward.

The reality is that Star Trek: Picard is not merely the worst iteration of a once-beloved franchise, but it may well be the worst written television show I've ever seen of any kind, period. It is an unmitigated disaster, and Alex Kurtzman, Akiva Goldsman, and Terry Matalas should never again be allowed to work on this franchise.",

Characters not only don't act like the legacy characters they are meant to be, but they also act inconsistently with their own motivations from one scene to the next. I get that you have to suspend disbelief for a show about humanoid aliens and teleportation and FTL travel, but it's not even just the Sci-Fi elements that they fudge - there are so many moments in this that you can just blatantly look at and say \"that could and would never happen\".\n\nThe fact that one of the big problems faced by the crew this season was not to pollute the timeline is laughable when you see the absolute carnage they wreak. Exposition dumps aplenty (if Picard mentions \"Kirk's Enterprise\" one more time I think I'll throw up - it's like he watched the Original Star Trek series along with us), I genuinely don't know who this show is supposed to be for - there are too many callbacks for newcomers to get half of what is going on, but it's got none of classic Trek's soul and ethos and is roundly derided by classic fans. It's just simply nonsense.\n\nThis actually might be the final nail in the coffin for Star Trek as a franchise going forward, if we ever expect to see any sort of return to quality. The only way that this train-wreck could be put right is if they were to pull a Dallas dream ending and erase it from ever happening. It makes a mockery of all that has come before it.",

Just keep the politics out of it please.\n\nThe FBI shows up with like a dozen agents, arrests Picard and Guinan, and they have video footage of Picard beaming in out of nowhere... so they seize Picard's (future tech) badge, start interrogating him..... suddenly Picard asks him \"why did you become an FBI agent\" and the interrogator explains how he was visited by Vulcans as a child... next scene, the FBI  suddenly lets him go because \"the interrogator got fired for reporting aliens\"? ... then 10 minutes later, the interrogator comes back with all his desk's stuff (as he's leaving the building)??? Is the audience is 6 years old? This is ridiculous.\n\nalso - why would they have Picard approaching his ancestor, alone in a hallway, and chatting her up? That's super weird and creepy. Old men who are strangers should not chat up young drunk women. Massively creepy and weird that they would include that in the show.\n\nThe whole thing with Soong's daughter is really confusing. Because when you have a daughter who's a grown woman now, and you're apparently a genius geneticist, surely you might explain to her at some point what kind of work you're doing? She's apparently home all day and has no friends, therefore probably gets most of her \"family values\" from Soong. And so it's just really confusing why she'd be so upset that she'd run away the instant she finds out as a baby she was grown in a lab. This is a very complicated ethical situation and they threw it together just to show her running away from Soong when he's \"evil\" for growing her as a baby? All that for what?\n\nBut the plot holes just go on and on. Borg queen going around eating car batteries because she wants lithium? That is really weird and doesn't make sense. But also: car batteries are made from lead and sulfuric acid.\n\nThe action scenes in episode 9 at the chateau were shockingly bad. Also: why are the borg soldiers using their gun's laser sight to look through windows?\n\nSpeaking of the borg soldiers - how did Soong somehow summon a few dozen soldiers out of nowhere?

Rather than a hopeful, optimistic future everything has to be dark, violent and depressing.  Worse than that, the writers can't even do *that* well - there are so many plot threads picked up and dropped it's ridiculous.  Season 1 did it and Season 2 continues it.  Discovery has the same problem; it's often wishy-washy soap opera with these would-be big emotional moments that have absolutely zero impact because the show is all over the place and really doesn't make a lot of sense.\n\nThis time around they're pillaging Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home, you know, the one with the whales as it's often referred to?  Except as usual they steal the premise, fail to understand what made it work originally.  Perhaps they should all go back to school and learn, or at the very least have the idea for the finale and then work backwards from there like a murder mystery author might, instead of flailing around writing terrible dialogue for a bunch of horrible, unlikeable characters who, funnily enough, are often cold-blooded murderers (looking at you, Seven of Nine).\n\nDon't believe any critic reviews who certify this as fresh - as with the Twitter hype it's probably CBS/Paramount paying people off to polish this turd.  It's even more shameful that Will Wheaton is shilling for this abomination as if that gives it more credibility - it doesn't.\n\nAll things considered it's one of the worst TV shows I've ever seen as it doesn't only ruin Star Trek as a concept, it demonstrates time and again what bad writing looks like.  I haven't mentioned Patrick Stewart yet, so I will - he's not Captain Picard.  Like the show, it's Picard in name only.  The authoritative, brilliant, diplomatic, \"violence as a last resort only\" character is dead and buried.  There's just a hollow old man collecting a pay cheque left, browbeaten by drug-addled, troubled and mystifyingly unbalanced female characters (because apparently that's how you write \"strong\" female characters these days, rather than, I don't know, in the style of Sarah Connor from the first two Terminator movies as a driven, passionate badass who only bends the rules for the good of humanity) and what can laughably be called the plot is such drivel it's hard to care.  They even managed to waste John DeLancie's talents as the usually highly entertaining omnipotent trickster Q - like all the rest, he's just dark and depressed and dare I say it, boring.  I suppose him and all the other TNG cast members were offered a pay day too good to resist, and in doing so help ruin the legacy of Star Trek in the process.\n\nI don't blame them though; as Mike Stoklasa said in character as Harry S. Plinkett, \"new boats aren't gonna buy themselves.\"",

What an absolute hunk of garbage.  The writing is so painfully bad.  They've ruined the most beloved character in Star Trek history.  Just when you think it can't get any worse, a new episode comes out and blows the last one out of the water with its plot holes and clich\u00e9s.  I am not just disappointed - I am livid.  They had a golden opportunity to send Picard and Patrick Stewart out in style.  Now he'll be remembered for this trash.  It makes me sad. I honestly wish I'd never watched this show so I could remember Picard the way he was meant to be remembered.  This may have put me off Star Trek for good.  Shame on the writers.",

After that however, it just became the same mess we've seen in all seasons of Discovery and the previous season of Picard: slow pased, very uninterresting or borderline annoying characters and a complete lack of consistency or logic. To me, the writers are just completely incompetent with the material they are dealing with. It's all over the place. It's so bad that season 3 is comfirmed during a running seasons and in season 3 they are appealing to the nostalgia by bringing back all the old characters from TNG. The only thing I feel by that is: ah great, more characters they can screw up. Visually the series looks great though, I'll give them that. I completely stopped watching Discovery after season 3 because I just didn't care anymore. I'm not there yet with Picard, but we're getting closer to that point.\n\nEdit: just saw episode 9 and changed the score from 1 star to 0,5. I wish it could go lower than 0,5.

Sometimes I am taken aback and ask myself if they are genuinely trying to trash Star Trek because they don't care and are trying to offend and make fun of the fanbase. \n\nIt's certainly putting a slow and painful end to any hopes that CBS and Paramount had of becoming a successful streaming platform. On the contrary, these expensive yet almost universally disliked reboots of Star Trek are providing a case study on how to completely mismanage one of the most well known global television shows, taking the franchise down with it at any cost.  There should be laws against it with the SEC as shareholders best interests certainly aren't being followed. Where are the ratings? Where are the viewership numbers? Where are the paid subscription numbers?  We can go by google search interest and see that it's virtually non existent. There is nothing here other than a personal vanity project by Alex Kurtzman, destroyer of every single franchise he's given the keys to, and yet he just bounces from cancelled project to cancelled project, after CBS already fired a bunch of other show runners who display any remote interest in Star Trek and understanding of it's product and fan base. Instead it's on this quest to calve out a new fanbase at the cost of the existing one. The general interest across the board is in cancellation, not more money into more dead end badly written garbage. Star Trek was doing better when there was nothing new on air. Now people are so unhappy with what has been done that they can't bring themselves to watch what came before any more either. AKA total destruction of 60 years in just 5.",

For me Star Trek was always about the a possible future in which humans have become a better version of our nowadays selves. The are not full of doubt, driven by instincts and greed. They had become something more. Willing to sacrifice themselves for the greater good. Discussing moral dilemmas and sometimes walked the line. This was why I was fascinated by Star trek TNG, DSN and to some degree by Voyager.\n\nBut in Picard's season 2 it shows pretty clearly that the crew fits perfectly in the 21st century. They are not morally superior. They are not driven by ideals. I do not know what the writters goals are. Maybe they think that they make it more realistic, but by doing is turning more and more away from this ideal world that was supposed to be the future everybody was working for. \n\nAdmittedly this future also never fully existed in the old shows, think of DSN \"Homefront\" and \"Paradise lost\", but they were fighting for their ideals willing to make sacrifices. The characters were still upstanding people. Taking responsible even if conflict occurred. This was what the Federation and Starfleet was about. \n\nThe new characters are weak in comparison. Giving in to fear, sorrow, greed. \n\nElements from too many parts of the star trek universe are used and not elaborated on. You see the Borg cube being an element in season 1, then the Queen poping up in season 2 without any major connecting story created around it all. It feels as the writers would have looked at statistics: Which are the most like enemies in Star trek and put them together like lego. When at the end of Season 1 a Star Trek armada appeared, the ships looked all the same. Even in the early 90s they managed to put together some different models, despite the fact that special effects were pretty pricy.\n\nAll this makes it basically just another poorly written and partly dystopian sci fi series, created purely for profit.

      "review": "Some of the older star treks had their share of shoddy and filler episodes, but they had more than their share of incredibly deep and personal stories, which is why it reaches across several generations, globally, and remains relevant whenever watched as it often becomes a proxy for personal struggles. \n\n\nI can't find anything that resonates here. It is all so shallow with no depth, no subtext, there's no skill involved, no finesse, there's nothing gained from a rewatch.  It doesn't respect the viewer and treats it like preschool children that need to be taught a lesson in not becoming bad. \n\n\nStar Trek has always led by example in focusing on the best parts of humanity by showing just how normal it is to not be conflicted, and what we can achieve with that. The Picard episodes understand none of that. \n\n\nHow alien would people from the 17th century seem to be if we met them today? Would they walk talk and act like people from 2022? Of course not.  Star Trek has always projected that peculiarity a few hundred years into the future where we are the ones who would seem peculiar with our present day values and attitudes. \nIn the Star Trek future it's a strange concept to not be focusing on the greater good and progression of humanity. Everyone lives and eats for free, people only go out of their way if they have a passion for something, but if they don't then that's okay too.  \n\nIn star trek Picard it's nothing like that. Everyone is angry, conflicted, they focus on what they want and openly argue about it when there's a clash. \n\nIt isn't star trek, and I can't pretend I support it any more. Even the pre-2009 VOD and merch, it all feels like I'm somehow giving approval to it.",

      "review": "Unfortunately, this series appears to have fallen into the trap of the lead actor playing himself, rather than the character of Picard.  It's not that I don't enjoy his interviews and public appearances, but it's just not what I subscribed to see, which is saddening as the name of the show is supposed to be about Picard. \n\nThat would at least make it interesting to see how the character develops in his later years, but when it's not actually Picard we see, and the other leads are apparently written by soap opera level of writer churn, we have unfortunately crashed and burned in a typical failed reboot which pays so little attention to the source material that it isn't even in the same universe. \n\nI don't understand who this show is aimed at. The forced nostalgia is abrupt and fleeting, like a university student who wrote a dissertation without ever reading a single book from the campus library, but instead flicks to random pages and pulls quotes in the hope that it gives the impression of an understanding through research where no actual research has taken place. The student thinks they have pulled it off, but the examiner deducts points for trying to fool them with what is clearly disjointed waffle. \n\nFor example, a massively jarring problem with the Kurtzman reboots is the sound design. It's clear that a library of star trek sound clips is used and mashed together for things like computer consoles and interactions. There appears to be no understanding that each series of Star Trek had unique sound designs to differentiate each other as technology gradually progressed with each 7 year series.  In these reboots that's all disregarded, and I assume that whoever is working on the sound design just has a massive folder of .wav files with a file name indicating what the sound indicates. Unfortunately there's no contextual indication of WHEN they were used.  After 7 years of Voyager and several feature films in which the \"red alert\" sound is replaced, now suddenly they are back 30 years in the future.  The same goes for transporter sound effects. Picard uses sound effects from TNG and the enterprise D, but ignores the 7 years of Voyager and several feature films in which newer classes of ships have very different transporter effects. This might sound like Manisha, but one wouldn't use the sound effects of a Star Wars light sabre whenever someone on the Millennium Falcon fires lasers. \n\nThat's only compounded further by the hero ship in Picard clearly not being a federation ship, and somehow has this mishmash of sounds from random series which the Star Trek fan hears as being non-sensical gibberish.  Discovery does this too, it has TNG console sounds, voyager console sounds, and Enterprise E console sounds. \n \nThe best analogy would be to turn on your windows 10 PC and hear the windows 95 start up sound. It's all so out of place and clearly shows that there isn't anyone in post production who knows what they're using from the source material.  They think they do and they don't know any different, which is the running theme in all these reboots. It's in the hands of people who are way out of their depth.  What did they expect to happen with a 50 year old franchise? \n\nBut alas, that is just one in a cascading collapse that takes two paragraphs to describe but could be done by simply having a Star Trek fan as an advisor with the ability to make decisions.  The franchise which has clearly been put in the hands of the wrong people, but who are getting paid to do it anyway and alienating what I can only assume is this show's target audience.\n\nI can't wait for the Kurtzman Trek to be abandoned by way of the inevitable collapse of the cash cow, not because I want something better to replace it, but because we all know in our hearts that these people are laying waste to the franchise with money from two companies who are hoping for survival in the transition to a world of on demand streaming, and they are willing to take Star Trek down with them if it doesn't work out as that's all they have to keep stockholders engaged. \n\nCBS and Paramount abandoned the core fanbase which made the franchise value what it was, and in attempting to tinker with the components of Star Trek to appeal to a wider and less-decerning action focused audience, they've ended up diluting the brand so irreparably. Star Trek is no longer recognised as an outstanding and lasting product, but instead is a clich\u00e9 of astonishing mismanagement. \n\n\nNot even the Star Trek fanbase want to be associated with Star Trek anymore. There's a distinct and clear definition before the 2009 action reboots in which Star Trek was abandoned by those with power over those who understood it.\n\nAnd please, for Christ's sake, it's not the case that every Starship captain has a personal cringe phrase for issuing an order to the helm, \"punch it\", \"lets fly\", etc.  It's simply that Picard has his \"make it so\", and the officers he served with adopted it too when they temporarily managed his command in his absence out of respect. It makes no sense that anyone outside of his command would know of it or use it, and Starfleet captains don't get told to make up their own version.  It was so difficult to watch what is clearly a passing glance at memes become a trope by idiot writers. \n\nYou dont understand the source material and are embarrassing yourselves in pretending that you do. You don't, and we should be clear on that. Pretending that you do has left the franchise in a worse and less profitable state than it was in when you stumbled into it, and it's damaged your careers.",

This is hollow, predictable, loud, and seriously dumbed down entertainment from a franchise that used to be insightful, moving, and exciting.\nWhere to start.\nThe characters seem to have done all of their bonding offscreen, as nothing in Season 1 warrants how any of them behave towards one another now. Actors who we've seen shine in other roles are given bland, empty dialogue that was either cobbled together from an army of chimpanzees at typewriters or slightly talented 8th graders who think their work is far better than it actually is.\nIt's disheartening to see drivel like this and Discovery earn high praise from critics, as real audiences will tell you this is a chore to slog through. If you truly loved TNG and the character of Picard, go no further. While Season 1 turned him into a bumbling apology monkey, routinely being barked at by what passes for strong female characters in modern Trek, Season 2 features an android walking around with Picard's memories in its head. An android body that, unlike Data's, seems to offer no added benefits. Does this Picard have an OFF switch? Do the writers even know Data had one? Probably not when you consider they think you can clone an android from a single positron. It's this level of deep stupidity that hampers the series from being anything but a nostalgic cash grab, and one that's not even been done very well.\nThe problems with this series are so numerous that I can't even begin to adequately address them hear, suffice it so say, anything that has lumbered forth from the cultural vandals at Bad Reboot and Alex Kurtzman is Trek in name only and should be considered a what if/alternate timeline from when Star Trek was genuinely well-written, optimistic and family-friendly.\nSheer f'ing hubris.

That would be ok if each episode was supposed to be stand alone. Then, the writing within each episode is just cringe inducing. Boring, stupid storylines abound. And then the characters. Please find a nice M class planet to leave Raffi on, the dumbest most annoying Star Trek character ever. Q and Seven are being totally wasted. Jurati is unbearable (please no more cabaret). Rios seems like a token, completely unnecessary. Guinan is just really bad (Guinan from TNG was someone you'd actually want to get a drink with, but this one is glib, snarky and generally miserable). And Picard\u2026.a bumbling, senile fool that bears no resemblance to Picard from TNG. Elnor - totally flat. Laris and the Latina doctor, both uninteresting. And Data/Soong/whoever and his robot/clone daughter Kore - the worst. Best character so far is the Borg Queen. Horrible acting (Raffi, Soong, Kore). All of this just makes me sad. Destroys memory of good Trek. This isn't even Trek. Doesn't look or feel like it.

Instead, most of these episodes are just boring side plots that seem to never advance the story. \n\nSome of the best TNG was where the Captain and First Officer act as lawyers to determine if the android Second Officer is a person, or when the show criticizes years of war brinkmanship by having Picard tortured and showing the problems if his supposed replacement in Jellicoe. \n\nUnfortunately, this new show still fails to have anywhere near that level of depth.

At least it didn't follow Discovery where they do a lot of important things only to have it all meaningless half way through the season, thank God for them not doing that idiocy to us twice...once was enough thanks.  There was a lot more character development this time around which was nice to see, though the action definitely a lot less.  Too much Borg in this series, first season was heavy in Borg elements, this season also had Borg elements...I wonder if they will rehash the Borg in the 3rd to make it a Borg trilogy.  I must admit for people from the future where crime is almost all but eradicated, they sure get arrested a lot in the past.  Season 3 will be probably the last we see of Jean Luc Picard as he is 93 as of this review...I hope they can double down on writing talent and go out with a bang rather then a whimper.  I hope they replace this slot opening with Section 31, if they replace it with that Starfleet Academy nonsense...I will be very angry and you don't want to see me angry, but seriously they have Prodigy which is technically new cadets of Starfleet just with hands on training rather then being in classes and Lower Decks which is what happens to low ranking crew directly after the Academy so do we really need a series about students at High School, I mean Starfleet.   Why not Romulan Tal Shiar or Klingon Warrior School or anything remotely more exotic and interesting.  Hell, if they had to go with the Starfleet Academy route, then throw in a twist and make it the Mirror Universe Terran Empire Academy...that would be at least remotely interesting.  They really need to take a chance and try something new, everything Star Trek has always been in the prospective of Humans/Terrans of Star Fleet.  For a universe of aliens out there, they have yet to fully devote a series or movie with something not Star Fleet let alone an alien lead.  That Calpain was too short lived as a Captain and it was still Star Fleet so that doesn't count.

X-Men might be at the best it's ever been right now while Picard & Discovery feel like a bit of a travesty.\n\nStar Trek used to have a sort of comfortable formula to it with types of episodes. Holodeck, character building, character bonding, world building, species lore, getting familiar with the ship itself, diplomacy, & battle. The characters were mostly chill, laid, back, & friendly. Episodes could be slice of life, horror, mystery, romance, bromance, or comedy. It had a unique architecture & it was colorful; a stark contrast from your run-of-the-mill sci-fi where everything is steel grey. Where is all of that now? Everyone is stressed out, aggressive, snarky, & unlikable. There are no friends, only acquaintances. Every episode is just more of the same thing.",

In itself, it didn't offer a lot, but it did set up a lot of elements. It was for the rest of the season to make something out of it. And at that, it failed.\n\nThe story itself is weak and takes unnecessary turns and detours, just to spread the whole thing out to 10 episodes. Even then, many scenes are much longer than needed, there's a lot of repetitions and also supposedly emotional moments that are inconsistent with the characters in it.\n\nOn a different note, I very much dislike the fact that they have the same actors play completely different roles in different times. It is cheap and sometimes unnecessarily confusing. Then again, one other character is portrayed by two different actors although even that makes no sense.\n\nThe only reason that this show gets 1 star instead of a half one is the overall solid directing and decent cutting. Yes, that's what it comes to. Although even here I must say that some episodes are worse than others in that regard. \n\nThis show should never have been made. It makes no sense from the artistic point of view.  Does it make sense from a financial point of view? I honestly don't know because there are no official numbers. I assume that the international distribution rights bring in at least some money with the Star Trek and Patrick Stewart names attached to it.

None of them are likeable and they're impossible to get invested in. The only one I like at times is Seven of Nine because she occasionally points out how stupid everyone else is.\n\nIn older Star Trek there was certainly social commentary, but it had something called subtlety, something the writers of this show have apparently never heard of.  Having characters go back in time for an episode or two could sometimes be fun, but basing an entire season around this premise is a horrible idea. The show feels like it's constantly punching you in the face, telling you the modern age is awful and your life sucks. This isn't fun to watch at face value.

Why do they bother.\n\nThings done and dusted over and over again. Not new. Not exciting. Not interesting.\n\nUpdate: I'm up to the penultimate episode and unfortunately it's not really improving. I blame the writers. The characters just don't make any sense. \n\nExamples (a few out of way too many): Elnor gets killed in a fight pretty early on. Then comes back as a seeminly invincible hologram warrior. He tells Raffi: I've missed you...? Even though his character is based on the last memory before he died, when they were still together...? Who writes this stuff? \n\nAt least the name Elnor is pretty cool. And goes well with the Elvin ears. Deliberate? But who is he? Did I miss something from season 1...?\n\nSoong goes from professor who tries to grow in vitro humans (or at least, that's what I get from it) to Borg-commanding-warlord overnight?\n\nI've always hated Brent Spiner in human characters. He's so convincingly evil in every role I remember him being in that I cannot like him. Sorry. He was great as Data where his \"humanity\" and goodness made him likeable, but in human-form he is invariable very unlikable and I suffer from the afflication that I don't like unlikable characters...\n\nPicard is mostly a doddering old man. Not that much fun to watch, although he has his moments. But, jeez, how many memories and flashbacks can you fit into each episode? It's not as if he's any more fun when he's a seemingly hapless child with a fake French accent.\n\nI was never a fan of his French background. Growing up in a castle, making wine. Clich\u00e9, boring and very hard to emphathise with. So they hide the ship on his old French castle grounds, but most of the street action is in San Fransisco? I know they have teleporters and such, but it's a bit of a stretch and kinda consufing. These transporters sometimes don't work and sometimes do? Seemingly depending on what the scene requires.\n\nTo be short. Nothing makes any sense and it is not all that interesting to watch. It's also very dark. Literally. So many scenes are in the dark.\n\nSo far my favourite scene is the return of the punk kid (now man) playing his song in the bus. One of a few references to \"The voyage home\". I didn't know that actor was a co-producer on that movie and wrote the song himself. Well done!\n\nAnd thank the lord for Jeri Ryan. She's the rock around which this series maintains a semblance of reasonableness. Every other character makes very little sense at all.\n\nMaybe the last episode will set it all straight...?\n\nFinal update, final episode. The final half of the final episode feels much like the ending of a motion picture. I made me wish this would have been that, and not have all the extraneous middle bit. And then please leave out Dr Soong, whose whole annoying arc seems to lead to nothing but set you up for another season or another spin-off series... Featuring Wesley Crusher, no less. \n\nThe first half of the final episode clearly shows the problem with this sort of time travel nonsense: you already know where it goes, so there's just mopping up to be done, but nothing interesting.\n\nStill. The end of the final episode is so well done and rewarding that it almost single-handedly makes up for all the failures of this season up to that point. I wish the 90% \"middle bit\" could have been more interesting.",

Star Trek always handled politics with nuance, it is not good enough to say \"this issue bad\" and turn your political enemies into caricatures of reality. Real Star Trek never created cartoons of its political issues. Just watch DS9's Beyond the Stars if you want to see how to do it properly. I think a middle school writing class would have come up with better scripts than these. Embarrassing.",

We had Starfleet acting like Starfleet, everyone was where they belonged in service, Picard was chillin with the hot Romulan babe ready for adventure, and of course The Borg coming strong with The Queen.

Sounded just like the junk all these people said that tore up our cities last year. None of this stuff furthers the story. 7 of 9, was never lesbian!!!

There's a reason this thing is only stitting at a 50% rating. We don't want liberal messages from you people. We want good stories without your agenda.

However, all this feels to me incredibly forced and does not cover the weakness and lack of originality in the plot itself, bad writing, and unfortunately quite bad acting (compared to what he acted like in the past) by the elderly Stewart...\n\nThe plot tries to merge the \"modern Star Trek\" sensational approach (keeping the audience on their toes instead of giving them time to think and enjoy) with classic themes by cramming every single idea from TNG into a single shaky plot. Iconic Borg, Q, Guinan, \"mirror universe\" feel, time travel from ST4, and even the punk from ST4, absolutely everything (and more is expected). Just glued together, not quite believable, with very little depth to it (depth was the primary quality why we all loved TNG back in the 80s).\n\nAt the same time, unfortunately, Patrick Stewart is no longer in his best condition. As much as I adore the actor, I think it's time for him to retire because his character feels week and frail, not \"like a rock on the outside with a soft inside\", which was what we all loved about the original TNG Picard.\n\nAll in all, just like ST Discovery, it's a failed attempt to resurrect the legacy of Star Trek with rare \"shiny\" moments for old fans. But yes, it is understandable that it appeals to the younger generations, which seek action. Unfortunately, the appeal is that of any other sci-fi or action show, not the type of appeal that made Star Trek the most legendary franchise ever.",

The Hope I expressed for the first episodes has been entirely wiped out!\n\nThey continue to ruin Star Trek with cringe dialogues and characters we saw in Season 1 and their political activism from the real world: Star Trek always envisioned a better world but has not taken real work policies and interpreted them in the eyes of a certain political ideology just to trash or promote them. This stuff is so cringe. \n\nThe good things *very very very little*\n\nThe Positives - SPOILER ALERT:\n- They learned from their mistake of this ridiculous fleet scene from season 1. We were able to see many ships that are dear to fans such as the Akira, Excelsior or Nebula Class. Awesome. That's about it. Few seconds out of many hours. Wow.\n\nThe BAD (Spoiler Alert):\n\n-The totalitarian xenophobic human empire that exists is not really believable. I mean it is the 24th/25th century and they are still fighting the Vulcans even though the Vulcans are pretty close to Earth relatively speaking. Shouldn't they have been eradicated or subjugated first after First Contact? I mean the Terran Empire was WAY more believable: There, the humans stole & reverse engineer Vulcan tech, then united with the common cause of the perceived alien threat and started to subjugate species after species. Many of those were integrated into the empire as citizens even (similar to how the Roman Empire handled it where it got its inspiration) but eventually softening the policies led to rebellions among the more recently conquered aliens which then sparked a domino effect and the demise of the Terran Empire. \nHere, with this bland fascist empire, there is no logic behind that totalitarian state, somehow the world ended up entirely as fascist due to a single event in 2024 for which they time to travel now to stop it. Ok, fair enough, but overly simplistic...\n- They really take contested and hotly debated issues from American politics and mix them into the series... please leave your activism out of Star Trek. Focus on the plot, the narrative and the positive nature of Trek without acting like a subtle political platform that could only come from people in their Hollywood bubbles... cringe!\n- The Borg Collective did suffer a major blow after the events we could see in the last episode of VOY but to make the Borg look like they are almost extinct makes no sense either from a plot perspective. Having received a serious blow for sure, but the almost demise of the Borg Empire? That is a bit too much and takes away an important antagonistic faction, probably the most fascinating enemy of the Federation.\n\nThe biggest thing after Episode 9? They turn the Borg into a faction that could potentially \"do good\" where Jurati (such a horrible annoying character) merges with the Borg Queen, takes the ship in order to peaceful seek out people in space that need help for a voluntary collective - \"salvation instead of assimilation\" they say and the Borg Queen is somehow totally fine with that COMPLETE course change of what makes the borg the borg. Not only are they ruining an important and exciting antagonistic faction, they also preach that \"everyone eveil can become good with just enough understanding\" Ooof, Kurtz Trek is SOOOOO bad!",

I would highly suggest that no Star Trek fan watch this as you can't unsee what they are doing to TNG. \nThis season becomes unwatchable about half way through episode 4 when the writers proceed to butchering yet another much-loved TNG character, this time Guinan and now also Q is a mentalist.  It's become very obvious that no one in the writer's room has the slighest understanding of the characters they are writing for. The 2nd episode opens with 7 of 9 wondering around and not realising that she didn't have any implants until she looked in the mirror. Did the writers forget that she only had one biological eye too? The doctor in Voyager made her an artificial one to go around the Borg camera in there which let 7 see in other wavelengths of light. Literally the first thing she should have noticed when she got up was that she can see normally again. NOPE!  Then there's a recast Guinan who Picard recognises but Guinan doesn't know him. At this point in the timeline nothing has changed, so Guinan should still remember Picard saving her life in the 19th's century. Guinan would be dead if she hadn't met Picard. Then there's Picard telling her to stay on Earth and not go home, knowing full well that if she doesn't go home it will damage the future as she will never become a refugee of the Borg and end up on the Enterprise D. It's just one canon issue after another and it gets absurd. I think it's being written by star wars fans who don't know much about star trek.\n\nI really get the feeling it's more of a Patrick Stewart project because the UK voted to be independent of the EU and can't let it go.  He and/or the writers have thus far utterly obliterated the legacy of the character Picard by turning him into Patrick Stewart. I have to turn it off now and just forget I ever watched it. It was a mistake. Don't make the same mistake, you'll regret it like you regret Picard's terrible death scene before immediately stealing Data's new body and turning Picard into a robot 5 seconds later after Picard killed him for a 2nd time. \n\nThe first episode felt like a TNG continuation that we had all been waiting for, not 100% perfect but it felt like they were rebotting the terrible first season having taken on board all of the issues pointed out by literally anyone who has ever watched Star Trek. Just don't go any further than that as that's literally all there is to it. After that it turns into an angry soap box for resentful writers and Stewart who just keep shoving their political views in every scene without being subtle in the slightest, which results in offending the viewer.

That being said, I do find this new season to be vastly inferior to the past one, with it feeling much more like something out of the Marvel cinematic universe than Trek; a good example would be the stupid one-liners the characters have with intended comedic value but mostly just feel out of place. The new actor playing Guinan is far too pessimistic for the character we know and love, and the timeline continuity errors regarding her history are simply unforgiveable. Perhaps the honeymoon period of simply seeing the character of Jean Luc Picard for the first time in decades made me relatively immune to the problems of the second season, but the bad writing and convoluted plotlines of the new one really feel off.",

Only to see the show get back in time and struggle to give STD a run for its money.  The show has devolved into slow trips around Los Angeles to despicably depict border officials as the purest form of evil and to whine about how so much of Los Angeles just is not woke enough.  Sad to see Guinan who was part of the racially unifying glory days of Star Trek and avoided injecting her radical leftist views into TNG replaced by someone who sounds more like Whoopi on the view.  I haven't given up on the season yet, but I'm hanging on a thread at this point.  Paramount+ continues to work at all costs to make sure no high quality Star Trek ever exists again.",

      "review": "What did Star Trek fans do to deserve this? \nEpisode 1 of season 2 started with an approximation of Star Trek, but then they've again gone down this dystopia plot exactly the same as the terrible first season, jamming in all current day political issues as possible with zero allegory, and it just isn't interesting anymore. \n\n4 episodes and the unsubtle themes are:\nHealthcare\nClimate change\nRace\nPoverty\nfascism\nTotalitarianism\nIntolerance\nCapitalism\nHomelessness\nPolice brutality\n\nIt's all over the place, and it feels like the writers are trying to point out that their audience are terrible people. In Star Trek the future is the utopia filled with role models working their way through difficult moral situations, but in new trek they point out the issues literally without allegory, and brand everyone who lives there (us) terrible people that Star Trek characters absolutely despise. So what is the takeaway from this supposed to be? You're terrible sinners but still have a very tiny hope that you can atone for your sins? This isn't Star Trek!\n\nSo I've jumped off at episode 4, I'm sick of recasting characters just to butcher their legacy and/or bringing in the original actors who don't play the characters anymore. It's Patrick Stewart is playing the character of Patrick Stewart and wants to show you how terrible the Brexit voters are, and how terrible people who voted for Trump are, and how terrible you all are for letting democracy happen, we're all climate change deniers and completely intolerant of everyone, and then proceed to continually bludgeon the viewer across their head with it every 90 seconds.  Trek has become a platform for these people who don't respect democracy and wouldn't know subtle allegory if it bought them a drink.\n\nI'll read the user reviews once it's all aired and then decide if I want to waste another 6 hours of my life watching, but as it stands it just upsets me and makes me angry that my favourite franchise has been hijacked by these people, and their only response is \"star trek has always been a reflection of current day politics\" as if that gives them a reason to be doing it constantly, every episode, all of the time, all episodes with no room for fun, escapism, intelligent thought or morality struggles. It's a teenage melodrama filled with adult characters behaving like drunken kids trying to find a party, then getting angry when they can't find it and it's all your fault.  \n\nIt's also a poor parody of other writer's previous Star Trek works. It shows a very poor understanding of the source material and creates massive canon contradictions on a continual basis. In other words - the IP is in the hands of the wrong people who are doing irreversible damage to it.\n\nClearly it's not aimed at Star Trek fans, it's more like a Netflix teen drama loosely based on Star Trek as either prequels or reboots like the endless Terminator movies which keep disappointing the audience, yet they still keep pushing out terrible movies. It's Star Trek in intellectual property only, and in no reality at the required standard of writing and acting the fans have always gotten from it.  It has more in common with what I have seen from the Lower Decks cartoon.\n\nI've also been upset to realise that no longer enjoy watching anything pre 2009 either now, the damage done is sadly irreversible like a battered spouse who can't remember the happiness before the relationship became violent and hateful, and takes no comfort trying to look at old photographs as each one reminds them of what it eventually became until they finally had the strength to walk away from the abuse. \n\nThat's where Star Trek fans are with these reboots, so it's now for an entirely different audience who are very open about the fact that they don't like anything before 2009, which should ring alarm bells that this isn't Star Trek at all, so I guess until the subscription costs no longer meet production costs, it's just going to carry on until it completely burns out and the intellectual property is sold to someone else as CBS and Paramount as a streaming service collapses into liquidation.",

She and Raffi have absolutely no chemistry and spend no time connecting with each other in any way so basically it is the same as last season.

This one is feeble, full of deep thoughts and always in touch with his feelings. A LOT. God, it's talky. Just like Discovery. It never stops with the relentless soul searching and these characters just never shut up about the internal struggles they have and what it all means. Good grief, see a therapist.\n\nGone is the commanding presence of the thirty-five years younger Picard. I know, people age. But they've turned this once imposing character into a weak mess, always questioning and unsure of himself. Stewart really seems like he's struggling here. His acting comes off as forced and strained, like he's always on the brink of forgetting his lines or unsure why he's saying them. Every word is slow and pleading and sounds like someone's grandfather shaking your sleeve and complaining nobody's listening to him. Stewart is too old for this kind of thing now. It's painfully obvious every time he's onscreen. He should have stuck with the original no he said to this.\n\nThe rest of the cast seem to be held back by this weakened, handwringing Picard incarnation. Let's just mention now that this Trek is like all the other new Treks. It's darker, slicker and much rougher than Gene's vision was. They all look great and are technical marvels. But this is missing the heart and much of the soul of the originals. A lot of it is straight up action movie nonsense complete with the same bad writing and dumb storylines. Seven of Nine is unrecognizable here now that they've shaken most of the remaining Borg out of her. Now she's just some kind of kick-assy sarcastic gay Zena Warrior Princess. None of the other characters leave an impression on me one way or the other. Cookie cutter, all of them. This is exactly what you get when a new bunch of people imprint their own take on the Star Trek world. I wasn't a big fan of the three reboot alternate Treks either, and this and Discovery leave me cold too. Worst of all? Both series are putting me to sleep in their current seasons. The writing is just boring and unimaginative dreck. If you like your new Trek served up like Die Hard, you'll get some thrills here. If you like traditional Trek, this is best left off your list.",

Everything else however is exactly what Trek fans want. The critics want change and want something different. But these same critics aren't Star Trek fans. The new fans have got something the old fans have been bleating on about for 50 years. The formula hasn't changed. Old favourites are back. (I'd be interested to see Q's mind and the Borg Queen's tenacity up against each other for the first time. It'd be like Superman vs Batman but without the testosterone). They've also been very clever. It's clear that going back in time has been a ratings winner in previous series and film so they've added that in. Yes it's been done before, but why change a formula that works. They're aren't trying to reinvent the wheel or provide alternatives to water, they are just adding to it. Having the Borg and Q plus bringing in Seven shows that the production team have clearly looked at the shows of the past and seen what works. They've obviously looked at the \u2018top 10' of everything Star Trek and included that as the base. Then they've added some really interesting characters and probably one of the funniest characters on TV. Alison Pill is laugh out loud funny as Agnes Jurati. Yes it's simple self-deprecating humour but thankfully through all that she's extremely intelligent. There's none of that message preaching going on that mirrors todays society. It just throws in action, unbelievable scientific babble, fish out of water and a race to the seemingly impossible. They have used just enough characters for one to dwell on without having to appeal to every human denominator. \nIt's a show worth spending time on. Unlike other shows in the franchise, (I won't mention the D word) this one you really don't want to end. It's not a take it or leave it kind of show. It's also of an age where patience is a virtue. We have to tune in next week for the next instalment. Can't wait!",

Amazing coincidence. Quick! Blow up the ship, Picard! That's the end of season 2 after 1 episode. Oh, no it isn't! We're going to save it by travelling back through time!

The first episode started well: brilliant special effects, good acting, and an exciting storyline; however, then Whoopi Goldberg showed up playing what used to be another favourite character Guinan. I swore I'd never watch anything she was in again following her comments on the Holocaust and turned the programme off. It's a shame as I think it could be a great story.",

The trailer for the rest of the season on the other hand looks like a complete cop out having the story set in the almost present day as if that hasn't already been done by all star trek shows, and other sci-fi shows, probably to save set design costs and imagination, 2024 honestly so very weak. The second episode along with the first is named drop central, how many familiar names can they squeeze in despite a different future would more likely mean those characters were either never born or were doing other things with their lives. Along with Picard it's more of a museum of Trek artifacts on screen with the plot seemingly heading in a Galactica 80 direction, there is nothing original in this season, its like the trek meets force awakens, with only one season after this, give it a miss, you won't miss anything.",
