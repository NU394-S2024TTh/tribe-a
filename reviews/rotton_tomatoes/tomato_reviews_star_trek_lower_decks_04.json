Instead it's just a series of memes and references (getting really self referential for jokes now, yeesh), and over the top silly and self indulgent plots for the sake of being silly and self indulgent using star trek references. Less of a show and more of a YouTube channel for casual sci-fi nerds.",

I also think people forget about the inevitable filler episodes we had to endure back then, when production values were a bit less strong.\n\nLower decks remains a completely different beast whilst still celebrating everything that went before it and cramming a lot of great stuff into 10 episodes.\n\nYes, not all of the current shows are amazing (looking at you, Discovery), but I genuinely think Lower Decks keeps getting better and better. \n\nMore please!!",

A shapeshifting race of aliens first (and only) shown in an episode of Star Trek: The Animated Series from the 1970's. \n\nBut the Vendorians have played a part in my acceptance and eventual love of Lower Decks. \n\nTo say I was ambivalent about Nu-Trek is understating it. I HATE Discovery. And Picard (until the third season) was only marginally better. So I didn't have high hopes for Lower Decks. I watched the pilot episode and liked it. But it was nothing to write home about. Then I watched the second episode where Mariner and Boimler are looking for a Klingon diplomat in a \"Little Andoria\" neighborhood. They go into a bar and see these two Andorians beating up and old man Andorian. Boimler, being the gallant Starfleet type, intervenes. But then the old Andorian shapeshifts into its Vendorian form and escapes. (It was grifting the two other Andorians.)\n\nIt was such a fast and funny joke. But I was like instantly \"Wait! Was that one of those shapeshifting aliens from that TAS episode with Carter Winston?!?!\" (I didn't even know the name of the species it was such a deep cut)\n\nIt was at that moment I realized\u2026 everything was gonna be all right. Whatever happens, this is a show made by Star Trek fans, for Star Trek fans. \n\nThis is great Trek.",

The ability to look at one's self in the mirror and see someone worthy of self-parody is a genuine virtue.  Never take yourself too seriously is the rhyme and reason of \"Lower Decks.\"  Only the most 'sophisticated' Star Trek fans will miss this point.",

It's probably the best current Star Trek  series which is saying a lot because Strange New Worlds is great & after 2 amazing seasons the last 2 seasons of Discovery were very disappointing.",
