The writers are willing to think \"outside the box\" with the challenges/situations facing the crew. Each character sees the world from a different perspective and that makes each character interesting, individually, and even more so as an ensemble cast.\n\nAnd I would be remiss not mentioning the regular references (homages?) to past Star Trek series (TOS, TNG, Enterprise) characters and episodes. The writers KNOW (and understand the philosophy of Star Trek). A gift for an avid Star Trek viewer.\n\nAlso, watch the \"The Ready Room\" interviews with the cast. It really brings life to the \"Lower Decks\" characters as each actor/actress imparts their perspective on their character. A wonderful view of the future!\n\nThank You Mike and Crew!",

Apparently this makes her a good friend? \n\nThe captain puts her ship and crew in danger because they cannot pass an evaluation course. The drill sergeant was onboard the ship. So that makes perfect sense to be that petty with this show's captain and crew. \n\nThey killed off the Bajoran security officer in season 1 and brought him back in the beginning of season 2.  \n\nEnd of the season the Captain who is also Mariner's mother is getting a promotion, and her daughter Mariner does everything she can to ruin this promotion. How is this character meant to be likable? Mariner goes out of her way to stir the pot among the senior staff about this promotion.  The thing is, Mariner does this because she doesn't want her mom to leave. Honestly she causes more trouble than she's worth. \n\nMariner can't handle constructive criticism from her mother. Surprise surprise.

Bilko with the great Phil Silvers and McHale's Navy which featured Ernest Borgnine.

Think Victor Borge or the great British \"Carry On\" comedies.  \nI binged both seasons together and what I really want now is ST: Lower Decks - The Movie.

Best of all is how they handled their Star Trek references for non-Trekkians. In S01, there were numerous times I was lost or felt excluded because I hadn't watch any previous Trek content. But in this season, they've improved on the writing so that even if you don't fully comprehend the reference, you can still understand the joke from context. Most of the obscure reference jokes are visual gags in the background, for the more dedicated fans. Of all the shows that I'm currently watching and enjoying, ST:LD is the one I most look forward to. \n\nI would wholeheartedly say it's absolutely worth getting through Season 1 just to get to S2.

Throughout the show there are themes of self-improvement, cooperation, and understanding. Season 2 has been particularly enjoyable and I cannot think of an episode that I did not find completely hilarious. In regards to many of the negative reviews, this show is not a children's show and it is a comedy so if you don't enjoy adult television or humour then this show is not for you.",

Another positive is that my fears about Mariner and Boimler from season 1 didn't come true. Mariner didn't turn into a total Mary Sue and Boimler isn't always shown as a complete idiot. I would recommend this show to any fan of the old Trek series, that don't mind the cartoon humor.",
