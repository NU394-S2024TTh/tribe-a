Although it doesn't introduce as many new major characters as Season 1, it features some of the most memorable scenes and moments in the entire series. While Season 3 delves deeper thematically, Season 2 still offers plenty in terms of character development, plot progression and emotional resonance. This season introduces and highlights on fan favorite characters like Toph and Azula, giving them arcs that elevate the story. Overall, Season 2 exemplifies what makes Avatar great - a fascinating tale told through a blend of comedy, adventure, gravitas and heart.",

      "review": "There you go\u2026that's what I call the best thing Nickelodeon has ever animated. I like this season so much more then the first season that it's frightening. And remember, I gave the first season a pretty positive review, but it's nowhere near the excellence of this season. The story here I'm not really going to go into so much detail about because once again, the over arcing story is great, just like the last season. But it's when the show is episodic that's really hit or miss. This season, however, was a grand slam in that department. The characters that they met weren't annoying, and if they were, not as annoying as they were in the first season, biggest example of that is with Jet. Speaking of Jet\u2026he's back for this season, and is actually fixed, which is a sigh of relief. Let's be honest, the characters in a tv show is what is going to keep you interested, not the story. Avatar is no exception, and the main characters are great. Aang and Katara are still great, but Sokka might have just became my favorite animated Nickelodeon character this season. He went from a hit or miss funny guy to arguably the best character in the season. But hey, our new member of the group, Toph, is also a great character, especially with her being blind, that seemed like a great touch. Our new villains, Azula and the other two, are also great and insane, and are better \"villains\" but not better characters. Now, I think Sokka is my favorite character this season\u2026but the best characters were Iroh and Zuko. I'm not gonna lie, but I cared about them a lot more then the main characters, and I still cared about the main group, but I thought what Zuko was going through was better. And I think that's all I have to say. If you liked the first season enough, you'll love this one, cause all the problems that season had are all fixed. Please, if you have the opportunity to watch this show, please do, you won't regret it. I know I haven't, and I can't WAIT to watch for season 3!",

      "review": "Undoubtedly, Avatar is a great show. It is a fun adventure series to watch but it has its flaws. The story is well-written as well as the characters. I would even argue that Zuko is one of the best characters to ever be written. However, the love story is inappropriate for the characters' age and even for the target audience. Speaking of which, having a very young target audience it impacted the progression of the show, making it too fast. Those are some of the flaws I've found in this show but other than that I would say the show is great. The direction is fresh and original.",

Princess Azula is an absolute perfectionist and a true prodigy when it comes to her blue-fired firebending, and she is determined on capturing the Avatar and her brother Zuko. Team Avatar also gain a new ally in the form of a blind, smart alec, earthbending girl, these two new characters are welcomed editions to the show. We get to watch as Zuko struggles to do the right thing as the line between right and wrong grows increasingly more blurred for the estranged teenager, his story arc is easily my favorite this season Zuko goes through a tremendous amount of development throughout this season and I loved every minute of it. This season overall was completely perfect and everything you could've wanted out of the sequel season to season one, our characters are developing a lot through the season some for the best and others for the worst and I enjoyed watching every minute of it, both the good and the bad.",

      "review": "Absolutely brilliant. The incredible action, story, characters, and writing overshadow any minor nitpick. Upon rewatching, I have learned that the key to Avatar is Zuko and Iroh and their dynamic. Before discussing that, I will mention my minor issues. Starting off, there are a few episodes I don't like all that much. However, others like The Avatar State, The Swamp, and City of Walls and Secrets, so this is a nitpick. I also think Azula is underutilized and not as cool as people say. She feels more like the generic OP final boss archetype than the complex character she would become. Also, some of her lines are a bit too sassy and obnoxious for me, sounding like a high school popular girl. Long Feng is also just kind of there, but his voice is very cool. However, everything else is perfect. The story progresses very naturally, moving from finding Aang a teacher to trying to find out how to protect Ba Sing Se to the inevitable final battle that does not disappoint. Some of my favorite fights in the series are here. The showdown between Aang and Azula in The Drill, Toph's incredible victory in The Blind Bandit, and the final battle in Crossroads of Destiny are all amazing in their choreography and emotion. Episodes like Zuko Alone, Crossroads of Destiny, The Drill, Bitter Work, and The Tales of Ba Sing Se are beautiful pieces of media. The Tale of Iroh, Appa's kidnapping, and nearly all of Crossroads are some of the best moments in the series. This is just scratching the surface of Book 2's brilliance. However, the best aspect of Avatar has always been its characters. In this season, the characters are great. Aang has a very strong emotional dilemma in the series and he grows a lot. His trauma of losing Appa is truly heartbreaking and leads to a great subplot. Appa's disappearance proved that he was more than just a mascot and an important part of the show. The subplot gave us great episodes like The Serpent's Pass, The Desert, and Appa's Lost Days.  Katara also grows much more than in Book 1, which is actually saying quite a bit. Sokka is incredibly funny and has a few strong character moments. Toph is a fan favorite for good reason (though I think Sokka is overall the better character). I also really like Mai and Ty Lee and how their opposite personalities work off each other. However, Zuko and Iroh are the absolute highlight of the season. Iroh is my favorite character and Zuko is the most well-developed one. Their dynamic is by far the best in the show, and their relationship develops really well. This is Iroh's best season for humor, wisdom, and charm. The stuff with him and his tea shop is hilarious and his speeches are moving (R.I.P. Mako). The bond between these characters is so strong and it it why the emotional and epic moments work. One scene in Crossroads of Destiny is a good example. Iroh and Zuko are surrounded by evil earthbenders and Azula. The scene plays out like this: Iroh- Did I ever tell you how I got my nickname, 'The Dragon of the West\"? Azula- I'm not interested in a lengthy anecdote, uncle. Iroh- It's more of a demonstration really. (Iroh drinks tea, Zuko looks at him and smiles, and Zuko moves behind Iroh as Iroh breathes fire). This scene is one of the greatest in the show as it perfectly encapsulates how well Zuko and Iroh know each other and how well they work together. I recommend watching this scene, this episode, and this season. It is my favorite in the Avatar universe, even above Book 3. The only other seasons of cartoons I might like more are seasons 4 and 8 of The Simpsons. This season is nearly flawless and I am so glad Shaymalan didn't make a movie out of this. However, the whole show is great and all 3 seasons rock. However, this one edges out Book 3 for Zuko and Iroh's dynamic.",

The character developments are so captivating especially Zuko's, so I guess he's my favorite character now! The writing started strong and finished stronger with a very exciting ending, almost like a cliffhanger! The episodes are full of rich characterizations and some have gut-punch ending (like one of my favorite episodes: \"Zuko Alone\") Some episodes are heavy on funny moments too and I think that's one of the reasons that this show is so great. It perfectly blends humor and the serious and emotional aspects of the plot! Also, the action scenes are very thrilling to watch! Avatar is not just a cartoon show for kids, it's really so great that I think it shouldn't be labeled as just a children show. \n\nSpecial mention to my favorite episodes \ud83d\ude02\nThe Avatar State\nThe Cave of Two Lovers\nZuko Alone\nThe Chase\nThe Secret of the Fire Nation\nCity of Walls and Secrets\nTales of Ba Sing Se\nLake Laogai\nThe Earth King\nThe Crossroads of Destiny",

Toph was also a good addition to the series and her episode that focuses on the way different people learn and how a teacher must adapt really resonated with some of my academic experience. Add to that the compelling ideas about how a loss of a sense increases bending ability which alludes to the idea that bending acts as a sixth sense was a clever idea. When I first saw the season I must have watched it out of order because I remember is as my least favorite but upon re watching it is a significant step up from Season 1 and an ultimately great season overall.",

Avatar: The Last Airbender has an incredible plot within all three of its seasons, beautifully played recursive themes, and perhaps the most perfectly executed examples of character development, especially through Zuko. Avatar is a series meant for all audiences.",

The pace and change of setting are fast enough to prevent maintain an engaging story but slow enough to create rich and meaningful tales with deep underlying messages, especially for a kids' show. But the most amazing part of this season is the characters. Each one develops in a great way that doesn't feel forced or too fast and maintains complex and nuanced relationships with the others. Toph adds a fresh new addition to the group.",

I could go on and on about how her character serves the plot in so many ways. Konietzko made such a good choice when he decided to make her character a girl rather than a man, as it served to subvert a lot of gender stereotypes, which is a popular theme in ATLA, but also just added spice to the show. 10/10",
