The opening episode Remembrance is one of the finest openings to any tv show. I also enjoyed Stardust City Rag and Nephante. What brings the rating down is the pacing with an inexperienced showrunner. When you get to the last two episodes, it feels as they were making it up as they went along.",

Rafi cannot act beyond her \"pissed off\" mode.\n3) Characters have no respect for Admiral Picard. Rafi contradicts everything he says and even tells him to shut up. Calls him J.L. , like some pet.  Is this how they treat the best captain in the Star Trek franchise? \n4) Storyline has serious holes.  The season depends on the need to make both Soji AND Ashu.  No explanation why the creators had to make Twins of her.  Just glossed over this critical issue to make the plot work.  (weak)",

      "review": "\"Star Trek: Picard\" - Season One Review\n\nSeason One of \"Star Trek: Picard\" offers a m\u00e9lange of new and old, but not always in the right balance. At its core, the pacing struggles and plot holes are glaringly apparent. One of the more conspicuous issues is its veering into overt \"modern wokeness\", which sometimes feels more like a misstep than genuine progressivism. Star Trek, historically, has managed to champion ideals that resonate across generations; this interpretation feels more like it's forcing propaganda under a guise of nostalgia.\n\nMoreover, the reintroduction of key elements - the Borg, Romulans, and the well-trodden synthetic debate - feels less innovative and more like rehashing old arguments. Especially the synthetic topic, which was thought to be resolved in TNG with Data. But the overarching disappointment? The underuse of Jean-Luc Picard himself in a series that bears his name. The blame seems to fall heavily on the shoulders of Alex Kurtzman, who seems to miss the spirit of Trek altogether.",

Every episode feels like its own movie ... the acting is good, the visuals are second-to-none, and the story lines are just as compelling, I felt, as the original Next Gen. shows.\n\nEach episode and season builds on each other so watching them out of order really isn't advised but I would rather you TRY at any point than not try it at all.\n\nMy biggest gripe with the show is that it ended!  What I didn't realize was that I started watching after the series ended/cancelled.  I was truly sad when I finished Season 3 and saw online that that was the final season ... although ... they most certainly left an opening for more episodes or a new spin-off to happen!\n\nIf you watched the original Next Generation series and gave it at least 3 of 5 then I think you'd be interested in this ... spin-off? ... continuation? ... Whatever!  If you REALLY enjoyed T.N.G. then I don't see how you would NOT like this show!\n\nPlease try and know that it only goes up and gets better from Season 1 Episode 1!!!",

      "review": "While some writing decisions left me wondering what the showrunners were thinking (Seven of Nine bringing a Borg Cube under her command was a wasted opportunity), overall this is a good series, and it's very underrated by some fans. For those feeling that it's not classic Trek, you're right, it isn't. Every era of Star Trek has felt different as they reflect the times they're made in. Compare the latter episodes of The Next Generation era with the original Kirk movies and they feel totally different in character and atmosphere. And those movies feel totally different to the original episodes of Star Trek, such as The Cage. On top of that, every series of Star Trek after the original (including TNG) has met with fans dumping on them and saying they don't feel like Star Trek. Fans said TNG wasn't Trek because it was a different crew. DS9 wasn't Trek because it was on a station instead of a ship. And I remember fans who couldn't stand Janeway at first. And don't get me started on how underappreciative fans were of Enterprise. But if you can accept that a new series of Star Trek will have a unique feel, and try new things, especially seeing as Picard is set in a new era, over 20 years after the events of Nemesis, you might hopefully appreciate what this show does right. It's very faithful to the lore of it's universe and covers a lot of ground in showing how the politics of the various galactic factions have evolved or changed, for better or worse. Most importantly, Picard is still Picard, an altruistic but stubborn diplomat who maintains optimism and ethics in the face of more cynical forces.",

The usual nonsense that comes out of an unimaginative mind. And Dr Agnes: the meta variable of the show that lowers the tone of any interesting scene with her quirky \"humour\", as if we're meant to laugh because we were thinking the same thing...not to mention she gets away with murder at the end of it all, but I suppose we're meant to forget about that.\n\nOverall, for the original cast, new characters Elnor and Rios (but not his stupid holograms), it's worth a watch.

Picard, played by a fantastic character actor (Patrick Stewart) takes what should have been a easy win by using what worked before and decides to make an 80 year old man into an action hero.  It is hokey and almost campy, if they weren't trying to be so serious, but not in a good way.

Some acting is quite good (Soji, Dr. Agnes, Elnor, Hugh, Seven of Nine), some is inconsistent/melodramatic (e.g., Raffi - overacting too often, Rios - neither fully convincing as an existentialist former Star Fleet Captain or as a comedic force, both the brother and sister Tal Shiar agents), and Picard is over-relied upon so that, sadly, the limits of his acting during quieter nuanced scenes sometimes show themselves. His most interesting theme of the challenges of aging and persisting despite challenges, are often lost to soap opera quality plot lines and dialogue.\n\nOverall, a significant disappointment, partly because we expect better from JL Picard and those in his universe.",

You can not watch it with your kids also - because it's how series should be done today - a loss without any benefit in return. Authors tried to quickly submerge us into characters depths, yet there aren't any - all feel unwarranted or plain.

Sometimes, though I've heard much, MUCH worse (Mandalorian anyone?).\nIs it heavy on sentimentalism and nostalgia? Most definitely. And, that's kind of the point. This is going to be the final chapter on the Sir Patrick Stewart \"Jean-Luc Picard\". The guys 80+ years old. He may be a health octogenarian, but at this point, each day is a gift. And, as the show is about JLP that's the tone it's going to take. It's an allegory about many things. It is also to tie up some loose-ends in the Picard story arc. And, it is also to illustrate that, no matter how old you are, it is never too late to evolve. \nNow, just like they did in the X-men, they have created ways for a character to be \"immortal\" by bringing in a younger actor and such. Star Trek is doing the same thing for Captain Pike, Spock and several other OG series characters. But, it will be a long time before anyone forgets Patrick Stewart's presence in the role, just like the ghost of William Shatner's Kirk has not yet faded. \nI for one will enjoy watching the 3rd season which has been stated to be the last one. And, I will also probably experience many feels. Not just of the nostalgia in remembering the series, but also connecting on a whole new level. Age and experience have provided greater appreciation and sensitivity to many of sense of generativity this show has tapped in to. \nIt will be a bittersweet season because of the many implications folded in to the story. But I, for one, not only look forward to its story, but the new stories that it could potential spawn. So, ahead 1/4 impulse power and, engage!",

The tone of the 80s movies was VERY different to TOS, for example. What I object to is that this show appears to be written by teenagers, who are incapable of nuance, with no understanding of story, character or motivation. Picard, as shown here, has literally nothing to do with the character from the original show. Nothing. And, in a way, that's a relief. Because it allows me to disconnect the show I loved so much, from this utter, utter dross. Still, I find it offensive that the writers had a canvas so expansive, and this is the best they could come up with. On the positive side... I guess it looks nice. Effects are fine. A fair amount of effort has gone into the art design. But that's just about the only positive thing I can offer. Whoever wrote this garbage should be genuinely ashamed.\n\nI could rant for hours about how completely this 'effort' disrespects the incredible legacy of Star Trek - but there's no point. I've moved on. I guess I should have known, given the people involved. The reality is that nothing I say, or do, is going to stop this show from being made.

I use to think Neelix from Voyager qualified as the Jar Jar of the Star Trek galaxy but now I think its that obnoxious Raffie. What should have been a bigger moment for Picard between the young dying Romulan cadet and Picard, his mentor, is hijacked by some of the worst acting / writing I have ever seen for a character. Its embarassing. I really want to like Picard but too often these newer lesser characters and their crudeness, pettiness, and cynicism hijacks the show.  Throwing salt into this wound are two episodes of just plain social commentary on present day.  Its bleak, its pointing fingers and there is no sucessful attempt to lighten the mood and laugh at our self as in previous incarnations.  Even the homage to Spock on the bus was lame.  The only thing this Star Trek has over the others is..well the effects look good.  Like Picard says with every new ship they keep getting slicker.  Unfortunately they are less artistic, less graceful and less inspiring.  It really does boil down to who is running the series and unfortunately they've allowed Stewart editorial control over the script as a producer.  Which I get it, they did so to get him on board but in hind sight it was a bad mood considering his previoius attempt at producing Star Trek ended in the epic bomb, Insurrection.  The greater fiends yet are the notorious killer of Transformers, Alex Kurtzman and the infamous Akiva Goldsman who wrote the Batman franchise into an early grave with Batman and Robin. Really this has bad written all over it from the start and no Q (John DeLancey), especially one who has lost his mojo, can save this tire fire.  Its only saving grace is that it might still end up better than the every topsy turvy disapointment that has been Discovery.  At this point I'm checking out.  All new Star Trek and Star Wars entries are just the studio dangling keys in front of a brainwashed mass.  From now on I'll stick with the classics on Blu-Ray and forget about anything J.J. Abrams or his cronies has ever touched regarding Star Trek...and for that matter Star Wars.  And just NO on further revitalising franchises and I mean any franchise even long running ones from the 1960s.",

I know this has all been said in other reviews but the show doesn't understand it's characters, the central narrative pillars that drove Star Trek, the shows that followed it or any other aspect of the universe that Gene Roddenberry created. TNG and TOS were an optimistic view of the future when humans had found peace and surpassed base needs for the betterment of everyone. The Federation were a beacon of justice and a force for good, not the petty, rotten and corrupt organisation in Picard.  The characters here are all broken tortured creatures who will never surpass their flaws, Seven of Nine has turned into a bitter murderous mercenary, Agnes is a killer and the titular Picard does not resemble the captain that fans grew to love from TNG and the movies where the name is the only similarity. The rest of the crew are miserable shells of people. This is a dark angry universe with a relentless underlying nastiness. Even if you can get past all this the stories don't make a huge amount of sense and frequently stray out of Science Fiction and into Space Fantasy. At one point the crew fix their ship by \"wishing hard enough\"with a magic device that warranted a single dialogue line earlier in the episode, a robot does a mind meld, etc... It is as if the writers have seen the names of things and people from TNG and TOS but never bothered to find out what they were prior to popping them in a lazily put together \"script\".

The answer is \"Mass Effect : Picard\" and it is an insult to the whole of the Star Trek canon.\nTo sum up the show, a xenophobic federation tells the Romulans to stuff themselves and creates synthetics after one of the most important episodes of TNG establishes them as having sentience and therefore be protected by the Prime Directive.  Meanwhile, Romulan assassins who have played Mass Effect decide that indeed, there has to be a race of Synthetic creatures in the outer reaches of the universe that want to destroy all organic life, and they are right, but they totally missed the ones made by Noonian Soongs grandson. So the Romulans go to a place where there is EXACTLY THE SAME CUT SCENE FROM THE FIRST MASS EFFECT GAME warning them that they have to destroy all synthetics and Naturally, this means the Romulans hack the newly created synthetic slave race that is building the ships to save the Romulans from extinction and make them destroy their only way to save everyone.  Picard makes it all better with the help of a man raised by Romulan warrior nuns, Seven of Nine, a Spanish captain with a ship, an expert on synthetics and a washed up federation drug addled mother who has an estranged relationship with her son.  There's also a captured Borg Cube being worked on by Romulans,  \nWhen Data asks to be killed at the end of the show, it is exactly how anyone who loved Star Trek should feel.  The writers, led by Alex \"I write everything in crayon\" Kurtzman who, for the 2nd time in his star trek career has ripped off a computer game\" writes a nonsense, overly convoluted yarn that rips out everything star trek used to stand for in favour of momentary fan service that ends up killing Picard and replacing him with a synthetic body that still ages, bleeds and...\nlook, can we please just kill these characters off and be done with trying to reinvent Trek.  The fact is that CBS are going through the same errors as Warner Bros did with their DC universe.... committing rubbish to the screen of this magnitude really does mean star trek is dead.  please just stop.",

In his old age he's come to recognize that the emotional distance he put between himself and others was only serving to hurt him and them, and I'm glad that he's progressed as a character in that front. The characters were all well developed - perhaps the weakest spots were how little time they had to explore Rios' relationship with Starfleet and the kind of handflipping they did with Agnes and how the vision affected her. There were definite flaws with the way the overarching story progressed but it is so hard to fault the show as being bad after we received an entirely fitting and long overdue proper sendoff for Data. I don't agree with all the directions they took Seven's character but having her back and growing as a person is wonderful anyway - and I'm going to admit that I personally loved the fact that they made her a canon queer.",

Despite centuries of time and progress, we have learned nothing.  Ourselves, and even every alien race, are nothing more than war mongering, self interested, na\u00efve beings for which the exploration of the greater universe has provided zero perspective.  Star Trek was about witnessing and striving for the progress and objectivity that could come from a newly enlightened human race, centuries in the future after correcting many of our flawed ideals. Sure there were still imperfections and selfish individuals, but in the case of Star Trek: Picard, humanity remains a mirror image of itself in 2020. Progressing only into space travelers, but not as a society for the better by even an inch.

In the last 20 years, these guys and their peers have declared war on fiction and sold sugar frosted dog crap as brownies to a trusting and desperate audience.\n\nYeah, I am not gonna be nice about this.\n\nI can be nice about Star Trek Discovery because I make it a rule that every Star Trek series needs 2 seasons to get its act together. TNG, Voyager, Enterprise, and DS9 all had rough first 2 seasons.\nBut Picard is not its own series. It is not trying to grab a new audience with a new gimmick and new characters for a new dynamic in a new production. This is effectively a season 8 epilogue to TNG and a new ending that the TNG movies did not give us.......... and in many ways, with that pedigree and talent such a production would summon, this had much further to fail. The bar was raised so they can fall from it even higher.\n\n\nHow dumb is the Script for Picard? A sky beam with a space octopus dumb.\nHow much of a waste of talent it is? I have seen Patrick Stewart play Bambi's father with more meaningful character development. Because the writers remembered the context of what Bambi's father had to deal with.\nYou gave Data a second death scene for THE WHOLE FRANCHISE.........and you left out Tasha Yar, Laul, Lore, and Dr Sung from his last moments of his life flashing before his eyes. Forget not being able to get the actors, Brent Spiner could have posed as B4, Lore, and Dr Sung straight away and the others could have been stand ins in the shadows or photoshop images on family photos.\n\nBut thinking of that lead me to realize the ROOT problem with Kurtzman's approach to trek: He must ONLY have watched the movies. Why else would the Borg be dismissible? Why else would NONE of Data's FAMILY be important in a DATA'S FAMILY story? Because they were not in those 4 movies? Why did Bruce Madox have to die? Because HE was not in Kurtzman's draft of the script for the ending, so writer's lower in rank than him had to put in REAL Trek Lore in the episodes Kurtzman did not have a strangle hold on. AND THAT IS A HEALTHY SIGN when I can attribute the good writing to stuff that must have been SNUCK in.\n\nYou could not call Lavar Burton to play Geordi? You know, DATA'S BEST FRIEND WHO WAS A SUPER SCIENTIST AND AN OFFICER ON THE ENTERPRISE? Could not call in Worf for the Romulan drama? You know, a member of the Enterprise and good friend of Picard that REALLY hates Romulans? Hell, would have made more sense to bring in some new actor as grown up Alexander son of Worf instead of............. Romulan Legolas................which makes about as much sense as Stalinist Merlin or Ronald Reagan's druid or a Mormon Ninja.\n\nFor fuck's sake. Star Trek is famous for a reason and not for Kurtzman's insights into it. But sure, he fails upwards. So we are stuck with him until he kills Trek like he killed Amazing Spiderman.",

I felt that the Borg incident was anticlimactic and the final sequence with the Romulans had lots of little issues (overly dramatic half ROMULAN half VULCAN leader, the new Federation ships didn't look quite rite to me, the fact that the Romulans just changed their mind and left without a fight).

That's why I was so disappointed after watching Picard's first season.\n\nThis could have been such a great show. Many of the original cast members were back, the special effects were gorgeous, and the acting was quite good. But the world that Picard now lives in is so depressing and bleak. The premise is silly with Picard blamed for events that were clearly not his fault (the Romulans had their own massive fleet of ships yet they blamed Picard for not saving more of them). Then every female in the show berates him with such choice lines like accusing him of \"sheer ******* hubris\" and so forth; really the profanity was not needed. \n\nIn the end Captain Jean-Luc Picard is reduced to a dottering old man who wanders through episodes with a confused look on his face while being berated by his Irish Romulan housekeepers, and every other female character in the show for that matter. At least if the reported paycheck of $750,000 per episode is true then I at least sort of understand why Stewart destroyed his legacy, but that doesn't mean I want to watch him do it.

Maybe this intends to reflect the present state, but Star Trek always was about ideals, what human society \"could\" be, strifes to be... not the greedy, ignorant version we experience now.\nAt least Pircard himself - graciously acted by P. Steward himself - holds up those ideals, which is what this series is about. And, in this theme, the series does a good job. Kind of. If it wasnt for the hasty character development, world building and plot development, which had me bloat out \"What? Why? Seriously!?\" a couple of times. Sure, the guy with a sword who sailed along in a spaceship for a while doing nothing, decides to stay on a hostile space station he knows nothing about, because... Why again? He got a sword. Thats sure gonna solve all issues. \"What? Why? Seriously!?\"\nA couple of moment were so extraordinarily stupid, I struggled to take anything seriously afterwards.\nJumping over those hickups, the series has bright moments. Deep, philosophical questions and moral dilemmas, which we love Star Strek for. If only those were imbedded in more believable writing. So in the end, my rating is a \"Meh, ok, What? Why? Seriously!?, alright, alright, 3 stars... maybe?\"",

And there are constant references to and reminders of morsels of information from the rest of the Star Trek universe that dedicated and observant fans will notice with delight.\n\nLast but not least, if you are already a fan of Patrick Stewart, and Jean-Luc Picard, the best Captain in Starfleet, it is criminal that you have not seen this already.

Like Star Trek: Discovery, this series presents a dark, non-optimistic version of Star Trek. Most of the characters are broken and hard to like, with the exception of Rios. The dialogues and character development are mediocre. This series negates any personal development that Picard and Seven of Nine have made in previous series.

Star Trek Picard sees fit to alter the fundamental nature of the Federation, Starfleet, and basically everything else in this world. It's turned Starfleet itself into a diverse hire paradise where every single senior officer is female. It takes established and beloved characters that we grew to know over the years or even decades and deconstructs them into obscene parodies of themselves. This show undermines the basic message of hope and optimism. Instead, it presents a bleak, hostile, greedy dystopian version of the Star Trek universe. It revels in gore, torture, violence and destruction, in a show that once had taken a higher path using rationality, understanding and diplomacy to solve problems. It does all of this, and for what, to tell a story that nobody wanted in the first place. To explore ideas that have already been handled by past better writers. To seamlessly forcing the creator's political views that none of us asked for or care about. Or was it just to squeeze the last remnants of fun enthusiasm from a franchise that pretty much has been run to the ground by people who don't know what the hell they're doing.\nStar Trek Picard is just another sad example of what happens when arrogant, talentless, shameless hacks try to elevate their own mediocre work by standing on the shoulders of giants.",

The show is a slow burner and it is season 1, it is also addictive and a great watch , so it has a seasonal arc, so what? Some audiences in particular are known for not handling long arcs and slower paced sci fi, look at the Stargate Universe dismissal or the end of Bablyon 5 for example. I am sorry but this IS Star Trek, the Picard character is totally believable, unless he was meant to be Captain America.... and the supporting cast generally work, although the jury is still out on the sword..... p.s. just this morning i was watching an interview with Leonard Nimoy in which he discussed the quality of scripts in Star Trek..hmmmm",

I really liked all of the characters in this story--7 of 9 was expertly played and and even bigger badass than ever.  I loved Riker & Troi in their rural homestead. All of these things makes the series a must see for me.\n\n\nPossible Spoiler Alert...\n\n\nI do feel like the Picard creators chose to weaken the Future Star Trek mythology as a means to draw in a new fan base and it didn't feel like an organic progression after \"Nemesis\" or the JJ Abrams's \"Into Darkness\". \n\nThe \"Picard\" storyline which drives the first two seasons is clever and interesting, but short sells the ideals and beliefs that Star Fleet and the Federation were imagined to defend. \n\nIt'll be interesting to see how consistent the new Star Trek Picard and Discovery universes can remain or if the writers/creators will use some kind of time warp cataclysm to cause the social breakdown along selected timelines. \n\nLastly, I wish the Borg had not been reduced to tragic figures. I hope the Picard writers choose to develop the Borg story line more fully--Beyond Hugh's independence, how did the entire hive collapse? Every system has \"anti-bodies\" which would continue to embrace Borg beliefs (at least for a time) we know human will and \"desire for freedom\" isn't consistent across all beings.

Certainly felt different in vibe compared with what I remember of the TNG universe we left in 2002's Nemesis.. but inuniverse (as in real time) 2 decades have passed and the world (galaxy) has changed as it constantly will. It does seem far darker than the more happy universe of 2360s that's for sure! Kind of feels similar in how the 1990s now seem so lovey-dovey compared with the relative depressive times we now inhabit in 2020 so the show seems at least relevant in that context, in how its really relating to our current climate. \n\nThe show itself is rocky in quality. I honestly can't pick out any highlight, though I felt overall the strongest episode was the one we catch up with the Rikers on their planet that they now live. \nThe new characters in the show are OK, but perhaps being this is the first season the acting is hit and miss. Stewart for the most part is excellent in his role but expect him to be a bit slower and bit more 'elderly'. This is not the Hot Picard action hero of Nemesis and the TNG films in general. He's more on the sidelines in terms of the action overall.\n\nSeason 2 is coming and I'm thinking this show will hopefully build on a relatively solid but sometimes weak S1 and develop really strong. This is certainly better than the X Files Reboot a few years ago. This show doesn't try to redo TNG the series at all and that's why this show has a chance of pushing on and getting better!",

Anyway hes just there to put the spotlight on the new gen of characters that are very unlikable, other than the crazy ship captain. \nThe last ep is a cringefest and like it or not you must see it to believe whats called Star Trek these days.",

      "review": "So I just finished binging all three seasons of Star Trek Discovery and the one season of Picard. Discovery feels like it was made for teenagers and millenials, a soap opera with no depth and way too much crying. Picard series feels like it was made for adults, and more a long the line of the Next Generation series obviously. The plot was very predictable without any twists, but seeing Picard, Riker, and Troy all on the screen at the same time again was a joy to see, they have great chemistry as always. The Picard series had excellent CGI and everything from the planets to the old Borg cube looked good. I found myself rarely rolling my eyes watching Picard, unlike Discovery where my eyeballs hurt from my eyes rolling all the way back into my brain. I hope there is a season 2.",

Needless to say, it was the best scene in the entire season (the last couple episodes are very good too). \n\nI miss characters discussing their issues and coming up with practical solutions. I want a group of unique people working together solving problems, not secretly working against each other for the sake of plot. I don't like snuff, and the last place I expected to see it was in this show, but it is there. \n\nAll said and done, Jeri Ryan's return managed to keep me on board for the lousy first half of the series. The prospect of Seven and Picard working together in a series is very appealing to me. While the show did have a satisfying last couple of episodes, it's held back by its desire to be like other modern shows - characters making stupid decisions or keeping secrets for the sake of plot, pointless action with nameless grunts dying en mass, a couple snuff scenes, and an elongated plot that didn't need to be more than a couple episodes stretched out into 10 because nobody knows how to write a tv series anymore and they all want to make extra long movies.",

This is so much better than the nightmare that is Star Trek Discovery AKA STD. \n\nWhat I've recognized from the canon that has been woven beautifully here:\n\nPicard's brain lesions that Beverly Crusher diagnosed long ago.\nHugh, the young Borg in TNG, is back as a recovered Borg. \nA Borg cube \"artifact\" as research site. Was this artifact a result of Janeways Borg Computer virus destruction in the finale of Voyager?\nRomulan synthetic life xenophobia goes right along with Romulan canon\nVarious Romulan secret societies  - yes, that jives and I love it. And I love learning more about Romulans.\nPicard having difficult relationships, such as with the new character Raffi.  Consider his bracing engagements with Commander Cisco in beginning of Deep Space Nine.  Jean Luc is not always a warm and fuzzy guy.  This relationship jives with his character.  Patrick Stewart is brilliant. \nPicard struggling with the loss of Data and the ban on synthetic beings.  Yes!  Data sacrificed himself in Star Trek Nemesis to save Picard and everyone.  Of course Picard would be burdened by this. \nBruce Mattox as contributing creator of new synths.  This totally jives.  Bruce was the person in TNG that wanted to study Data, and Picard had to prove that Data was sentient and had a right to determine his own fate. Picard stuck his neck out for Data.  Mattox was disappointed.  Of course, Mattox would have found ways to continue his research. (Too bad, they did get the same actor to play Mattox in Picard.)\nSeven of Nine as a sort of Marshall in the lawless regions.  Why not?  Potentially bisexual?  Why not?  Devastated that Echeb, one of the young Borg that she helped to rehabilitate in Voyager, is murdered?  Of course!  He was basically her son.  Of course she would be crazy mad. Bringing Seven into Picard's sphere?  Terrific.  Wonderful way to tie together the lives of our favorite Star Trek characters.\nPicard turning to old friends for help?  Of course. \n\nI think this show is great.  It shows that the Federation is not infallible.  It presents the destructive force of xenophobia, but also shows why xenophobia can develop, which is relevant to our time in 2020.  STP, like the other series, explores that there are likely malevolent and hostile forces in the universe. It also has great character developments.  \n\nThere are many new elements to enjoy, and numerous nods to the Star Trek universe throughout the series. STP is spot on.  I love it.  WATCH IT multiple times.  You will love it too.\n\nThe theme and intro are also beautiful.",

It's really pure luck that anyone who he suckers into his sphere of influence manages to survive at all because he does nothing but use them and then leave them to their own devices as he blindly pursues his vision of right and wrong.

Too, talkings about peace and acceptance but many episodes are full of unnecessary violent solutions and action scenes. The production throw us to the face the most uninspired ship designs of the whole saga, that in the season finale offer a CG confrontation without any sense more than show the biggest number of these uninspired  (and by the way small as cars) ship designs. \n\nFor more than I LOVE to see again face to face Picard, DATA, Riker, Troy, Hugh, etc. with the exception of what they had done with 7 of 9. I cannot stand the most part of the new characters/actors with special focus in Rios or Raffi, non mention about their smoking and drinking habits that may Gene Rodenberry ideas about the future have a facepalm in the afterlife. \n\nIs a mess, tastes much less StarTrek than Discovery, something I wasn't expecting at all, and I just hope this season suffers of bad scripts and confused new actors as the 1st season of TNG. \n\nIs a mediocre season, with some teally charming moments in the hands of the classics, with some new cool bad guys, but with a big bunch of new good guys that have zero chemistry with the classic actors or even between them.\n\nThe beginning is interesting, the end is bland and tries to drink on nostalgia and Brent Spinner to solve the big problems of this new series that doesn't seem to know what it really wants to show us.",

The original Seven of Nine character was a positive female role model. She was willing to reach, trying to overcome and gain inner control after a traumatic past. This character is just nasty and an insult to women--a misguided response to trauma. Then they kill off three more popular characters.

If you were trying to kidnap a very dangerous person, why would you beam a few people into their apartment to lose a fight when you could just beam the person you want to kidnap out of their house?   The answer is that the producers wanted to start the show with a jason borne style fight and didn't want to get bogged down in the details of why that doesn't work in the context of this world building. \n\nThe original sin of this series is that it tried to make show that was tightly linked to Star Trek Nemesis, which is by far the worst and least popular movie.  \n\nThe thing about Star Trek is that the utopia isn't a gag. There's no \"gotcha! They're eating people!\" or some other Aldous Huxley reveal about how utopia comes at great cost.  Star Trek argues that a better world IS possible.

It's message about artificial life is so confusing and mismanaged that the audience will wonder what the point was at the end. And it's handling of the world and characters it inherits is intent on breaking audiences expectations of Trek without earning any of it's choices. Episodes are long and full of wasted time and energy. Scenes feel like they serve no real purpose other than to fill that time. And character's motivations are weakly formed at best. Picard himself mostly feels like he's along for the ride, rather than an active participant in his story. Data is for some reason the chosen cornerstone for this story even though Spiner seems well over the character and the plot uses the well-despised Star Trek Nemesis as it's prime inspiration.\n\nInstead of showing the best of humanity under adversity, Picard chooses to show us only broken people. But whereas it's predecessors allowed the choices and moral questions of the show to define and hone those shattered people into better people with purpose, Picard instead just throws them into a whiz-bang action sequence and calls it growth. Well trodden characters like Seven of Nine have their entire arc tossed aside for the benefit of creating a \"bad-ass\" character. Picard himself is shattered by a choice that honestly doesn't seem really in his control. And all the new characters all given slow push-ins with dramatic music in place of development. \n\nWhile DS9 and TNG skillfully managed episodes dealing with corruptions within the trusted institutions of Star Trek, Picard uses it as a device without  any real satisfactory examination of the moral and ethical failings of those institutions. The Federation bans artificial life and we are told that's bad. But the catalyst for that choice is artificial life more-or-less causing the genocide of the Romulans. So as a viewer we kind of get why that ban would be in place. And to make it more confusing the artificial life that the show is protecting is...organic...It's a confusing mess. And the backstory of how she's kind of Data's daughter doesn't help matters.\n\nPerhaps, the most disappointing thing is we explore nothing new. The show manages to go an entire season not managing to achieve what a single episode of any trek show before it does. Even Discovery, manages to have some episodes that explore new ideas, cultural or ethical questions, or scientific theories. Picard does none of that. It barely explores it's own characters with anything more than lip service.\n\nTo top it all off, viewers get shown Data is still alive (kinda), only to then watch him ask Picard to kill him. What's the point? Just want to milk a little drama? Sure as hell seems like it.",

And not gonna lie but, some of the so called classic star trek is boring.\n\nThe show is great and makes you invested in the characters. There is action but not excessive which makes Picard instantly better than Discovery. The only main issue I have with the show is the F bombs dropped by certain characters, it just doesn't suit their personality.\n\nI know the show is being picked up for another season which to me seems very unnecessary given the way the first season ended.

First of all, I didn't really like X-Men, and I could see some \"convenient\" parallels with the story in Picard and the X-Men movies. Then, I also think Picard as a character was often very sanctimonious in the TV series and movies. Athough the writers seemed to focus on making him a bit more \"human\" in this series, perhaps they could have done just a bit more in that direction, in much the way, Kirk and Spock wound up being more open about their own BS, at least to each other, I would like to have seen Picard open up a bit more then what he did. The acting is difficult to gauge, as these people are only as good as the writing, so, let's just say there's a fine line between flashbacks and lengthy speeches....when out of balance...it effects the FLOW of the story and character development. It did. There's ALOT of moving parts here..and so this was probably a herculean project. I'm glad they did it...I just wish the tenor of this would have been less melodramatic and more real.

It's certainly worth a watch if you are a Trekkie or TNG fan.  \n\nThat said, it's got some plot holes.  It's got a very unlikely curtain call from Riker, reminiscent of the 1980s style.  I'm not buying the Riker/Troi offspring casting and character.  I hate to say it, but I hate seeing an aged Deanna Troi as she goes from interstellar hot in TNG to mortal.  It was a nice surprise to see Hugh.  I didn't care for the casting of the Romulans.  Selfishly, I missed Geordi and Worf, but that would have been too much like a TNG reunion.\n\nI'm unsure that a season 2 will be as successful.  I'd love to see Picard get some swagger back.  You cannot go wrong with seven of nine!  Isa Briones was really great!  She can dominate season 2 with character development as long as they don't make it so lame as Data's endeavor to be human. You can dump Alison Pill's character.  Give Captain Rios some of his swagger back too.  Get some of the old crew and let's go sprloin'.\n\nOn a final note, I have to say that the sending off of Data was just perfect to me.

Never are the characters allowed to bond with each other or the audience, resulting in a story that lacks soul. Never is there a lighthearted moment, making all the \"intense\" scene (i.e. all of them) feel like more of the same. With no frame of reference, the stakes never truly feel high.\n\nSeven of Nine has become a cynical terminator. The Federation has become corrupt. Even the new characters can't save the show, feeling like shallow tropes played out in every other mediocre action franchise. Picard makes so many attempts at creating depth, that it never really takes the time to develop any of them, causing everything to fall flat. When a hundred and one things are happening at once, how could you possibly expand upon any of them?\n\nThe plot is contrived and implausible. There are numerous scenes so unnecessary that they could have been cut out of the show entirely, with no effect to the story. Not only are these scenes unnecessary for the plot, but they don't endear the audience to the characters or provide any relevant information. In other words, they're completely useless.\n\nPerhaps the worst moment in Picard is when you are forced to witness Icheb, a former Borg drone from Voyager, be tortured by an antagonist. The scene is extremely gory and difficult-to-watch, and for no good reason, considering there is nothing in it that couldn't have been conveyed to the audience in a different way. It leaves a bad taste in my mouth that Picard brought back an old fan-favorite only to torture and kill him.\n\nThe cinematography is overdone and distracting, adding to the confusion created by the already-too-complicated plot. There are so many lens flares and closeups and \"poetic\" camera angles that it becomes hard to keep up. The producers clearly think that more = better, when in reality, sometimes more = a visually-appealing train wreck.\n\nStar Trek is dead, and everyone involved in this killed it.",

The main storyline is utterly boring, and Picard seems to have lost his mind -- he just lets his swaying emotions make all decisions for him rather than think them through. He would never have become a starship captain at all had he acted like this in ST:NG. Supporting characters come and go with little rhyme nor reason. Some show up just for fan service. Others who seem important simply vanish, I guess because all the writers got hit by amnesia. So little effort was put into this series, it's like it was designed as a cheap throwaway.",

      "review": "Picard is Trek's message at its finest. Picard has a bittersweetness that may be too much for some fans to handle. Seeing one's heroes age and soften around the edges with time can be painful, even if it's a television show. Picard has aged, the federation has changed, for that matter the galaxy has changed. Picard's Star Fleet is not the same armada that welcomed home Voyager in 2001 and The Captain is not as spry as he was ,last we saw him, on the bridge of the Enterprise E  in 2002. And the way the story is told has changed. I think the team at CBS did a great job bringing Trek into the 2020s. It's sometimes dark, definitely conveys more emotions and humanity, the characters we love have aged, been wounded, Some have more to lose than ever and some are simply looking for a reason to carry on. The new characters are played by incredible talent. But for me the series best performance was Marina Sirtis' Troi. She  is the very epitome of empathy in Picard . You can see the pain that other's are trying to hide come through in here eyes, she doesn't even need lines... but she has some great ones.  Not as good as Picard's speeches or Riker's \"debriefing\" of his former captain. and Rafi is one of THE most humanized characters in franchise history. Her struggle is real, the pain, the frustration, the regret,  the anger, the self pity, the longing for acceptance... so relatable. So many great characters, all multidimensional. Loved it!!",

Emotional beats seemed predictable and uninteresting, the minor details where other contemporary trek shows have shined seemed lackluster. While Star Trek: Discovery had interesting and varied ship designs for every group they encountered, Picard only showed two classes of federation ship, two Romulan ships, two types of shuttles, etc. The Holograms in discovery are glitchy and build up a small background arc of the the technology getting shelved until the Picard era, while in Picard the background elements tell no story. This lack of world building could be forgiven if the story wrapped up in a satisfying conclusion, but I found myself somewhat uninterested in the final episode and hoping for new stories and character arcs in season 2 rather than wanting to see more of what's been established in the first season. Overall, the intriguing and well done setup to Picard earns it a few points, as does it's decision to leave the season in a place that anything could happen in season two rather than tying itself down to specific arcs, but its not what I had wanted from a return to 24th century trek, nor was it an especially pleasant surprise.",

The Romulans find evidence that of a Galactic wide apocalypse caused by artificial life and Souji, despite being an all round pleasant person (android) who has friends on the Borg reclamation station, gains a father figure in Picard, has a sister she communicates with who is in love with a person, she is has a pleasant experience with Riker and family where she learns about the death of Riker's son and the emotional grief the daughter went through, arrives at the Android planet sees Noonian Soong Jr and Bruce Mattics living side by side with androids in peace and sees the absolute lack of hostility between the crew and settlers. After one small moment she decides that she will summon a robot tentacle monster to destroy all organic life in the Universe. The show goes to length to show that thinking androids (not Data) are similar to us, except for their processing speed and superior strength. Does this not justify the Romulan response.",

The explanation that the current bad writters have for the change makes no sense at all. The dialogue was terrible, the themes discussed were overly simplistically analyzed. It's hard to believe the dialogues were carried out between highscool graduates, let alone high officers and scientists. Picard as a character was inconsistent with TNG, except for the episode 'Tapestry' (that was an excellent written episode with great dialogue). The current Picard seems like the logical evolution of the alternate, cowardly and dreary man from 'Tapestry'. He appears as senile and overwhelmed and with no authority whatsoever. Everyone yells at him and he apologizes to everyone for everything, while not knowing how to handle simple events. I watched every episode with the hope that maybe in the next episode there will be something better, at least small things, small dialogue, but the overall story and the the way it evolves turned everything bad. In every episode there is so much bad writing, with so many small and big inconsistencies, that makes Picard one of the worst showes in a bad year for TV/streaming. As a separate and personal note, not related with my rating: I'm an AI specialist, and AI doesn't work the way is portrayed in TV shows. It doesn't work like that since Asimov's days. I understand that AI is there just to create conflict and ask questions about what is truly human, but if Hollywood just makes a little research about AI than there could be better and more relevant stories to be told about this subject.",

I read several articles where Patrick Stewart was excited to do the show because he thought \"there was something special there\". Well with all due respect to Mr Stewart (whom I admire greatly and will watch anything he performs in) who by his own admission isn't a Star Trek or a science fiction fan. Why is it so difficult for CBS or Paramount to find an actual fan of the franchise to write these shows? Where are the Okudas? Where are the folks who took pride in creating and continuing Gene's legacy? Whatever at this point I can literally vote with my wallet and choose not to give CBS any of my money.

Patrick Stewart continues to do a great job as Picard. Since this is supposed to take place twenty years after the last Next Generation movie, we do get a naturally progressed take on the character. Picard is older now and retired and has gotten to that old man point in his life where he stopped caring what anyone else thinks and has loosened up a bit.\n\nThis show varies from TNG by being serialized rather than episodic, giving this an almost theatrical quality. The story and the different places our heroes travel to are interesting. There is also a small sense of humor that helps balance some of the darker parts.\n\nHowever, I admit this isn't a perfectly written show. (There were moments where I considered rating this a little lower but then there'd be a moment that would remind me why I liked the show.) The emphasis on character development does eat into the overarching plot and I felt that parts, especially the revelation of the big mystery, weren't explained as well as they could. The show is also pretty confusing about what parts of the universe need money and what don't.\n\nThere are moments that feel like they were ideas from the writers and weren't natural. There will be a couple of times where you'll go \"Wait! What?!\". In particular, this applies to some of the kills in this. I'm not one of those people complaining about the show just because it's darker. (Even TNG had its darker episodes.) However, some of the kills in this feels like the writers were going for a \"Games of Thrones\" shock value rather than really being needed.\n\nPicard looks pretty impressive for television, keeping the look and feel of the nineties shows but able to do this on a larger scale. I especially liked that they kept the bright lighting scheme from TNG. Be sure to check out the opening credits.\n\nOverall, I can see how some people could like this less than me because there are some legitimate parts of contention, but I at least recommend you give this a shot before you make up your mind.",

I love TNG, but it's not MY Trek, if you know what I mean.\nAfter this disclaimer let's get on with my review. This show is confused, and mentally impaired. It not only cannot keep the established continuity of the Star Trek franchise, having to retcon a huge amount of established lore. It also can't seem to follow it's own logic needing a rather large amount of \"suspension of disbelief\" to keep watching. It's suffers from beign generic and unimaginative, needing to use tropes and plots from other successful stories like Mass Effect, to push forward a mess of a plot that is so confused as to what it is trying to say, it says very little.\nBecause I'm foreign to USA/UK politics, I can't say if it's pushing any social propaganda like some people might say. I can say however, that its lessons are so out of touch and contradictory, I don't believe it to be neither progressive, nor conservative. It's just uninspired.\nFor those who love bullet points:\n- 90% of Star Trek lore has been retconed, making the Discovery more Star Trek. Clearly an achivement in itself\n- It's own internal logic is flawed, making contradictions with itself\n- The ship drama is a below average sitcom\n- There are no real moral lessons, no exploration of humanitys past or present problems\n- Its story is not interesting or compeling, using cheap tactics to spark and emotional response.\n- It's exploiting past Trek entries to create an illusion of a developed universe as an excuse to keep the drama going.\nFor a trekkie it is rotten. As a standalone Sci-Fi show it is below average.",

      "review": "First, the positives: it looks good and obviously had a bit of money spent on it; I did enjoy some elements of the story. However, as I commented about ST Discovery, we're still not seeing the optimism of what made Star Trek unique. Most worryingly, for someone who remembers TNG the first time around, it didn't feel like it was Jean-Luc Picard at the helm of the show. The main problem with modern Trek? The storylines are just not that imaginative. Yes, the vocabulary involved often sounds complex and inventive but the actual concepts are poor science fiction. The trap was sprung - too much reliance on highlighting current social justice issues. Furthermore, recent Trek incarnations always seem to involve grand scale outcomes such as saving Earth, the galaxy or existence itself. This is not what the Original or Next Generation series were all about. A wide variety of science fiction writers and contributors worked on those earlier series and I may be wrong but I'm not sure that has happened since the 2009 reboot. Maybe the producers need to realise that it is okay to take risks by creating stories that are small scale with new characters (possibly based on one spacecraft and a charismatic team of seemlessly diverse people?!), and involve intelligent exploration of challenging science fiction, morals and the development of the human race in a future that makes us want to live there. Good luck to those who are entertained but I suppose I have to accept that the franchise I grew up with and loved is a ghost of the past; I so want to like Picard and Discovery but they're just not pioneering in the way that they think they are.",

Star Trek Picard has big blockbuster movie visual fx and is entertaining to pass the time, however, I would not call this Star Trek.\n\nAfter watching the first season of Picard, I was left in a bit of bewilderment as to what I had seen.  Personally, what made Star Trek great was every episode was its own story following a group of individuals who were put into various situations.  Star Trek showed the best that humanity had to offer show them as a strong, but compassionate species that was able to bring together a wide variety of alien cultures for the sole purpose of protection, cooperation and trade.\n\nPicard to me has sank so low, that it felt more like a Star Wars saga. Every major character from the previous shows including Riker, Seven of Nine, Data made appearances but in a blink of an eye where gone making me ask myself, \"What just happened?\"  *SPOILER* When Riker swoops in to save Picard with his fleet of ships, felt like an epic scene but then within minutes the battle was over and Riker was gone left be befuddled by the fact that Riker was completely oblivious to the fact that his best man was in distress and dying.*END SPOILER*\n\nEven Seven of Nine's character has been changed to a point she isn't even Seven anymore.  She went from being a Spock-like representation of a Star Fleet officer rediscovering her humanity with her star crossed lover Chakotay to an emotionally driven mercenary who has an affinity for women.\n\nSeason one of Picard as a whole felt very disconnected and pieced together nonsensically with the over arching plot of, \"Save the cheerleader, save the world.\" Rather than it being one of those shows that you look forward to watching every episode, it really feels like one you should just wait till after the season finale to catch up on and say meh, it's something.",

Keeping the ray of hope, a crumb of optimism, the idea that the things can be improved alive. Amazing visuals, good to excellent acting, heartfelt moments, smiles and tears...everything packed in so-so little- just 10 episodes of about forty minutes each.  Not enough to develop every detail and leaving a lot of the plot connections to the viewer, not being able to satisfy every Trekkie desire to see more of this or that character or justify every plot turn. But able to develop the characters so that we warmed to them and ad them at least to our head cannon. And of course, this was watching 400 minutes of the amazing acting of Patrick Stewart and enjoying the acting of his new crew. I don't want to go through every up and down of the series.

Part of what made the character Picard interesting was his human frailties, both psychological and physical. Now, the writers can pretty much do whatever they want with the character, even make him super human. I think the writers really screwed up this character but there's no turning back now.

It feels like they took an idea for a science fiction series, couldn't sell it to anybody on its own merits, and slapped a familiar and beloved Star Trek character onto it in order to get somebody to greenlight the thing.\n\nA lot of shows these days are able to make the ten-episode format work without completely botching the pacing. Not this one, though! Everything feels rushed, character motivations aren't readily apparent \u2013 ever \u2013 and stuff just sort of happens and then maybe someone will use dialogue to explain it after the fact.\n\nJust by way of example: in the last episode, the characters literally use a magic wand \u2013 I wish I were making this up \u2013 to get around two very significant problems they're having: they crashed their ship at the end of episode 9 and now it won't work, but poof! Magic wand! Now the ship is fixed! Then, later, they take the ship and fly out to confront the Romulan fleet that is attacking the planet, and poof! They use the magic wand to make a million holographic copies of the ship!\n\nIf you liked the Rise of Skywalker, you'll absolutely love the finale of Picard. Because it does a lot of the same things and uses a lot of the same lazy writing. It also actively seeks to sabotage the ending of a previous film in the franchise, as it effectively resurrects Data and asks us to witness him dying a second time. \n\nWe also witness Picard's death from a vaguely-described \"brain anomaly\" \u2013 which, I guess, they had to do something like that because Star Trek medicine can cure cancer as if it were nothing, and there just isn't any space to actually make up and then explain a whole new disease with all the stuff that has to happen in these ten episodes of streaming entertainment. \n\nBut then, moments later, Picard's death is instantly reversed when they transfer his brain into a robotic body! So Picard is now an android. But don't worry, he doesn't have any special powers or anything, and he will DEFINITELY not be immortal, because the other characters made sure that they programmed his robot body so that it would expire on its own after some number of years, giving him \"the exact amount of time he would have had if not for the brain anomaly.\"\n\nThis is stupid no matter which angle you look at this from. \n\nBut oh well! I guess this is the fate of science fiction in the 21st century. Bad writing, eye-pummelling visual effects, and so many edgey gritty dark edges on everything that you risk giving yourself a nasty cut on account of all the edges.",

This takes some adjusting to but after you get accustomed to it the show is that much more rewarding and enthralling. In other words, episodes 1-3 build the premise, plot and setting (perhaps a little too much so) and then it gets good until you find yourself at episodes 8 and 9 where you're really involved. The season finale is fun and a bit quirky but, if you're a fan, very rewarding. The nice thing about this version of the Star Trek universe is that it references TNG and other series but you get a glimpse of what life might be like for more ordinary folks and there's a bit of self referential humor thrown in for good measure. \n\nThe fx and computer UI look great and we can only hope that these science fiction bits will become realities like the how the original Star Trek foresaw cell phones, iPads (tablets) and more.",

      "review": "In Season 1 of Star Trek: Picard, Sir Patrick Stewart dazzles us with a master-class performance by returning to one of his most iconic and beloved roles. Even when some of his fans may not see it, Stewart gives us a perfectly-aged, wizened Picard who is always just a little more aware than everyone else in the room about his own mortality which, as he discusses with Data in the Season 1 finale, makes it all worthwhile. Some fans, perhaps expecting to pick up with the Next-Generation-era, force-of-nature Picard, may not have fully appreciated that episode 1 of ST:P picks up some 20 years after Picard's last known, active status - at least not at first.\n\nStewart's nuanced - and progressively energetic - performance anchors the story throughout Season 1 of ST:P, which is an exquisite, and often very specific, sequel to Star Trek: The Next Generation, the flagship of the marvellous 90s-era Trek TV offerings. It is also a sequel to the decidedly less marvellous, though certainly fan-worthy, Star Trek film 'Nemesis', which is consistent with one of the main memes of ST:P's first season: twins. As fans know, Picard himself was 'twinned' in 'Nemesis' after the Romulans cloned him for dark and murderous purposes, but later abandoned their nefarious plot as too risky (and in another twin-related development in the plot, there was of course Data's twin, B4). \n\nAs a sequel to both, ST:P soars in both story and cast. Those who have been distracted by what they perceive to be an overly dark and unnecessarily dystopian future have not appreciated the full message of ST:P in its first season, namely: there is always room for humanity to grow\u00a0and progress. The growth and progress of humanity was always one of Gene Roddenberry's central themes for the future and has, despite what some critics of the 21st-century-era Trek offerings claim, carried on in ST:P. \n\nAs much as I like it, though, I would not necessarily recommend ST:P to newbies as an entry point to the Star Trek universe. It is, after all, a sequel to both a major motion picture and a television series that lasted seven glorious seasons. As the vicious half-Romulan, half-Vulcan General Oh might say, it is only logical that those be watched first. It is not an imperfection, it is an invitation. Luckily, in this age of on-demand, stream-it-when-you-want-it digital viewing, that is a task most easily done - and a very worthwhile one at that!\n\nFor seasoned Trek fans, though, ST:P gave us a wine most worth waiting for, as if carefully cultivated at Picard Estates themselves. Not only was this a series where the writers clearly knew their stuff in terms of the background facts (known as 'canon' to fans), it was also one that was beautifully produced and skilfully directed by many talented people, including Jonathan Frakes, aka Riker, on a weekly basis. \n\nTo turn a phrase from the series, Star Trek: Picard is \"perfectly imperfect.\"",

Great actors were given the most vacuous things to do.  By most accounts, the actors loved playing in this show, but the result wasn't coherent for the viewer.\n\nTypical Bad Robot flashy physics were in play. Characters could get from A to B in an instant, whether the distances were in light years or long hikes. The Drama was hollow. A dramatic moment, undone instantly\u2026. Constantly.\n\nThe last 10 minutes, after all the build-up of the series, had nothing to do with the season narrative. Some great acting in there trying to tug at heart strings that left me honestly feeling nothing.  \n\nThe last minute had character interactions that had no build-up and in at least one case, zero-repercussions from previous crimes.\n\nCharacters were interchangeable with their skills, and simply disappeared when the writers either forgot they existed, or they needed another character to do something. Having a Cyberneticist, who hadn't been to space before, suddenly comfortable at a navigation station and quoting the Picard Manoeuvre wasn't fun to watch.  RIP Emergency Holographic crew\u2026 you were needed, wouldn't have impacted on the drama\u2026 but forgotten.\n\nThe Episode 9 MacGuffin one of at least 2 that paid off in Ep10 was so blatantly obvious that I was desperately hoping this \"X-Men 3\" scenario was some sort of bluff\u2026. It was not.\n\nThis series could have been 20 episodes of Picard: \"Logan\".  A beautiful, \"sweary\" journey where Picard made a difference one last time over two, 10 episode arcs.  But CBS and Bad Robot couldn't get their act together and changed their writing roster to boot.\n\nI don't know if Season 2 of Discovery and Season 1 of Picard equates to being twice bitten. \n\nHelp me Obi-wan Orville\u2026 you're my only Star Trek hope.",

Star Trek - at least in my opinion - is a metaphore. This series so far is a long bath in explicit brutality, the darkest parts of our soul and unwiseness of our species. Which can reflect to the World - indeed - but that way it is the direct opposite of Star Trek, which is always cherished the power of seeing and seeking people's good sides, the strive for knowledge, to find comfort in literature and history and to thinking in a scientific way. And last but not least it always teached us to have the courage to live by these things, and not bend to immorality, what sadly is stable ground of this show. To say something good about it, in my opinion Data's death was beautifully interpreted. To become as human as he could be, he has to die like every living creature.

However you might not like the writing in general or the drama in general. Understand this. Nothing can take the old trek away. You still have 10000000000 seasons of the good old stuff. I like the bold idea that they can try out new themes and new styles. In terms of plot. It honors and follows the original shows + movies line well. Many people have an issue with Picard being out of character. However this is not true. He had the end of season 7 + all the movies to evolve and open up. That he did and we see his realtionship with Data grow in the movies as well as having had grown. Both these men where calculating and in a sense emotionless who grew to care with each other. That means Data grew to care about his finite mortality as well. This show borrows ground from all the movies and shows. The biggest weakness is easily that you have to know all of that and then still be opened to a new way of exploring it in a way. Very bold, just like trek itself.

What made TNG so wonderful was the exploration of philosophy and ethics through reflection of modern events and issues in the 1990s within the context of a better, more just future. That was 30 years ago!!!! Picard manages that same philosophical self-reflection but of our modern western world in 2020. Some things are better, many things are worse. That is simply our reality and if holding a mirror to ourselves makes fans upset, then you have been incredibly self-deluded. What is so absolutely fantastic about Picard is how the creators and Patrick Stewart have been able to integrate elements of TNG into a novel and updated world of Star Trek and the character of Picard himself, who is not the same Captain we watched and grew to love, but an Admiral 30-years his senior at the twilight of his life and career. We should all be so lucky. Please do not listen or allow any of the silly reviews on this website to bias you. Give Picard a chance. Do not go in expecting TNG. Expect something new, something older, something different, something engaging, a show that not only holds a mirror to modern times through a TNG-colored lens, but to you yourself; an older, more experienced you, one that grew up watching and loving TNG.",

      "review": "Overall, this is a disappointment. Once I accepted, based on the trailer, that this would be yet another dark and conflict-focused show, I did like what they came up with as the focus of the conflict, because it was a new type of being, which is good for a \"Star Trek\". And I allowed myself to be pleasantly surprised by the way they used somf of the old ST technology we were used to in some new ways (like for a certain fight scene).\n\nBut beyond that it's been disappointment after disappointment, and I haven't been able to watch most episodes without some fast-forwarding. First of all, most of the character writing and acting is bad, everyone's \"too cool for school\" and throwing snappy replies all over the place, just like the totally obnoxious characters from Discovery. Picard himself is unrecognizable, there's no serious and dignified attitude anymore, he never wears the uniform, never stands up for Starfleet's high principles, spends time with some ragtag band of misfits, which is completely un-Picard-like, and worst of all he's the focus of some strange \"Picard Cult\" the writers have created INSIDE the universe. WTH is that?! There was never any premise for that in TNG. He was just one of many Starfleet captains with healthy attitudes and principles, there was no reason to make him out to be this great hero that everyone knows about. He's a great hero for US THE VIEWERS, not in-world! It's very tiresome to keep seeing characters give all kinds of extreme reactions on finding out who he is, that was never what Picard was about - being a galactic rock star.\n\nReally the only likeable character in all this is dr. Jurati, because she has some realistic non-superstar modesty and is well acted. The main female character(s), while they do have some humility, are not well acted at all, the actress they picked does not have enough emotional range, even though she's almost passable because she's at least not acting like a superstar all the time.\n\nAnd while I fully expected there to be some throwbacks and a conversation or two about the good old days, it turns out that there's almost no episode without some sitting around the table scene, having a boring conversation about how things used to be and irrelevant stuff that happened in the past that does nothing to move the plot forward. This is just bad writing.\n\nThen on the tech side they also failed to make this a \"Star Trek\", with the most annoying part being the ship interfaces, which have nothing whatsoever with the LCARS we used to know. I could forgive the fact that they went with this popular stupidity going around these days of making the GUIs transparent and therefore unnecessarily hard to read, but they could have at least preserved the general \"okudagram\" look, to make them feel like \"real Star Trek interfaces\" to us TNG fans. But no, they threw that part out as well.\n\nBottom line, there is no trekking, nobody's seeking out new life and new civilizations (we're practically served the new life on a plate in the first episode), and this is not Star Trek. Thank Seth we have The Orville, which I can't wait to see continue.",

It lacks heart and soul (with the exception of 1 or 2 moments). It lacks pacing. It lacks character building. Even the ship designs stray from ST.

I also recommend Voyager's \"Scorpion\" 2-parter (easily the best Voyager story ever) and the film Nemesis (not the best movie but this was the last time we saw Picard and it ties into the new show in several ways).

Patrick Stewart could read the phone book with the same passion and at least that would have a logical narrative flow, but here, speeches are canned, corny, and ultimately just time wasters between the next lens-flare CGI shot of lost Buck Rogers and Battlerstar Galactica fighter castoffs. Maybe this seems smart to the casual viewer with no investment in Trek's history, but for fans of Star Trek, it's just more self-referencing, smug throwaway garbage in the same vein as the last two motion pictures.

The introduction of old characters who has their histories continued behind the scenes, giving us an up-to-date presentation of them is heartwarming, to see these beloved characters develop as we'd want them to, and not just stuck in simple scriptwriting.",

      "review": "Picard is the only show that I hate watch. It doesn't feel like Star Trek, it feels like a 2 hour generic sci-fi movie spread across 10 long hours. Takes three episodes to get a ship to ya know... Trek around the stars. Two back to back episodes where nothing happens. The cold opens have suicides, mass murders, and utter violence rather than letting me get into episodes before showing me the gore.\n\nThis feels like sitting around talking. Lots and lots of 2 people talking in a metal room. 20 - 30 minutes of it in single episodes. It's an utter struggle of boredom. Everything is so poorly lit that it all blends together. The Borg cube is dark, the hero ship is dark, the only thing with light is Picard's Chateau that they bring the Chateau with them when they finally take off for space. The Chateau is a part of Earth and doesn't feel very Star Trek, but there I go hoping for a new Star Trek and then when it's given to us it's spent on Earth the first few episodes except for a Borg Cube that's just sitting there for the season struggling to exist except for to be part of a Romulan plot to show villains discussing villain things while trying to not have sex together despite being brother and sister. Yeah... you heard me.\n\nPeople smoke, people drop F bombs, people drop hints of cash and money in a time where Earth did away with that sort of thing. I can understand when it's civilians, but did the Federation give up trying to hold its people to a higher standard or did the writers just forget that the Trek Universe is to be a higher standard? People with big houses complaining it's a hovel. Tacked on scenes where a character tries to reconnect with her son that she was too busy for despite never hearing about the son before. There are plenty of these side stories that don't really go anywhere, but every character seems so haunted by their past or just a murderer.\n\nAnother flaw with that Borg cube is that it struggles to have a place. One character is just on a Borg ship for two episodes away from the cast. No one seems to want this character back despite knowing exactly where he is and Picard knowing him since he was a boy, he doesn't seem to rescue him. Speaking of one character on the Borg ship, another member of the cast starts out on a Borg ship away from the cast and she seems to be the plot, to rescue her, only she gets rescued and then there's nothing at stake. The plot fizzles and it feels utterly pointless. Previous Star Trek series have single episodes where they come up with solutions that save planets and save lives. \n\nThere seems to be a Federation without actually having a Federation beyond an admiral and a commodore. Everything you knew about Trek is just wiped away. The Federation won't help the Romulans when their sun goes super nova, a thing that can be predicted centuries if not millennia in advance. Picard taking all the blame for not helping the Romulans enough when he was the guy helping. The show loves to harp on that.\n\nThe biggest glaring problem is that if you aren't invested in this 10 episode storyline it turns into a chore to watch. Even they forget the storyline which revolves around saving a girl who is a dead comrade's daughter. Once she is safe, nothing happens. The drama ends and it turns into a holding pattern of fluff. It's tough to watch Picard struggle with lines with his age, that I pray is a character quirk and not the real Patrick Stewart struggling.\n\nI feel like there were two strong episodes, the first and the halfway point where everything felt like it paid off, but I can't tell if I felt it was good from watching 3 or 4 hours of dull television or if it was actually good. There were hints of episodes that felt like Star Trek where a space crew would go off to a planet, land, do things, and then leave, even if they weren't saving the world or entertaining me.\n\nI'd love to feel that this was a great show because I love Star Trek and that's the only reason I keep watching. Most Star Trek series have bad first seasons, but I felt like this was an awful chore to sit through. Now I love hate watching Picard or I would have given up on it a long time ago like so many other dull shows or bad science fiction shows.",

      "review": "This show is a masterclass in contrived writing, non-existent character development, and overproduction. The characters seem to exist only to advance the recycled plot device from Discovery season 2. For example - the Rikers are written a son who dies of an incredibly rare and incurable synthetic disease. It just so happens it was only incurable because of the synth ban. All of it feels like the writers just needed to add the backstory so that Deanna could say, \"Real isn't always better.\" Hey writers - really obvious plot devices aren't always better. \n\nThe pace goes from overly slow, drawn out, and uninteresting - to overwhelmingly fast. For example - we get what feels to be about 20 minutes of Picard pining about Data - juxtoposed with 30 seconds of Elnor trying to help the borg and hue dying. It all happens so fast, there is zero emotional weight or connection developed between Elnor, Hue, and the audience, and then it all abruptly ends. Until next episode - where again 7of9 arrives out of nowhere and within about one minute of screen time - everything is resolved. I imagine the writers felt it was quite clever when they had poor naive Elnor duped by the caricature of a Romulan villain into an \"open\" fight - only to have Hue die as a result. The lack of build up and time spent leading the audience into what should have been a powerful moment of character and plot development, leaves us with a wham, bam, thank you ma-am...all flash no substance scene. \n\nIn general, the dialogue is clunky and uninteresting. Jarring use of expletives is thrown in and completely fails to accentuate any rising drama or stakes within the story. What the writers do instead, is just piss off their loyal fan base that has kept this franchise afloat for over 40 years. Perhaps the writers could have some care in not alienating their core fans and constantly finding ways to flip the bird to trekkers.\n\nThe use of holographic technology is clunky, gets in the way of the actors, and just makes them look awkward on screen. We lose any tangible connection between them and their ships/consoles. Overall the production of the show feels like the love child of JJ Abrams and Michael Bay. Lens flair, unnecessary use of zooms, pans, shaky cameras. It's impossible to even feel like you are in a scene because the camera never settles. \n\nThis show is an absolute train-wreck and tragedy, especially considering there are very strong writers like Kirsten Beyer in the room. Is this show an example of too many cooks in the kitchen and comprises made left and write, so what we are left with is a jumbled together mess of a story? I never thought I'd watch this show and find myself saying - ok, that is enough Picard. The character, universe, and story are so uninteresting I'd be fine if they never bothered to continue it. What will it take for some good science fiction to hit the small and big screens? \n\nThe last episode was so difficult to watch, with the juvenile dialogue and plot development I had to pause it and write this review. I also had to create an account just to write these.\n\nIf the showrunners are going to bother giving us a Star Trek show with interesting characters, character driven plots, and well written and executed stories - just stop.",

The characterisation of the new characters is abysmal and Picard is weak and hollow, he has hardly any charisma or style, he's just a depressed dying old man not the proud, strong and charming Captain that he was in TNG. Nothing much has happened to him since Nemesis to make him so bitter and down, his character is not believable here. The show has no fun or passion in it and the dumb writers have created a convoluted story which damages canon and disregards many aspects of pre-existing lore. The Federation is portrayed as an evil dictatorship and Starfleet are a bunch of mercenaries now. The show has no joy or optimism. The writers and producers have made a bad excuse of a science fiction show and just slapped the name Star Trek and Picard on it for prosperity. This is not Star Trek and disrespects Gene Roddenberry's creation. His utopian, Intelligent vision of the future has been replaced with a dystopian, dumbed down vision full of sarcasm and swearing. Some of the acting is painful and Patrick Stewart's performance is lukewarm and his portrayal of Picard is just like Xavier in Logan, tired, frail and hopeless. Everyone talks down to Picard and he needs others to do everything for him. The show is slow and after the first episode it is a meandering bore until episode 7 and even then it's still dull but seeing two old friends of Picard in the episode is a welcome sight. The few TNG characters you see only get brief scenes and hardly do anything it's such a waste of some great characters. The music in the show is good and the bits of Jerry Goldsmith you hear is great but it makes you sad because it reminds you of good older Star Trek and you realise how much potential this show had. The visuals are decent and good CGI but every ship is Kelvin-verse design and the lens flare and camera angles are annoying. Overall this is the worst Star Trek I have ever watched and one of the worst science fiction shows in years. Star Trek Discovery is better than Star Trek Picard and Discovery was not very good at all. Terrible show.",

I wrote at these writers level back in 2nd grade.\nThese new writers in Hollywood working on all of these new shows suck, it's like they recruited them fresh out of elementary school. \nPlease with the new merger of Viacom and CBS take all trek off TV for a year and focus on lining up a new trek saga. And use Rick Berman and David Mack to spear head this thing. Bad robot is bad for franchiss. You want to end a franchise use bring bad robot in and watch them destroy everything that ever was .\nI never knew 2009 was the start of the great disregard of listening to the fan base.

It gleefully celebrates in literally torturing characters (some beloved from previous Trek series) and ignores Gene Roddenberry's optimistic view of the future. Sure, Picard himself is still an optimist, and as genuinely a good person as always. But he's surrounded by series regulars who murder, drop F bombs, and try to numb their problems with steady doses of hard liquor. Graphic violence is jarring. In a recent episode, a character has his eyeball pulled from his eyesocket, which is shown in excruciating detail. My daughters freaked out. Then, another character sees no alternative but to kill the poor guy on the spot to end his suffering. Later, the same character murders someone else in cold blood. This blatant, matter-of-fact graphic violence and acceptance of horrible morals have no place in this franchise. Star Trek used to be something a family could enjoy together. I have been a Star Trek fan since The Original Series, and Picard is perhaps my favorite fictional character of all time right next to James Kirk. So you can imagine how difficult it is for me to rate Star Trek: Picard as rotten trash. Disney has it right with Star Wars in that it has not stooped so low as to produce material that a family can't watch together. Poor decision making and a rejection of optimism and emotional intelligence will doom Star Trek in the long run.",

Does it perhaps even present an original idea, and does it deliver a satisfying end? Are the characters believable and authentic? Are the values and ethics consistent with what we know about Star Trek and the relationships between its protagonists fleshed out? Is it visually appealing? On all counts but one Picard is a complete and disappointing, nay utterly insulting, failure. Where it doesn't fail are its special effects and sets. It's true strength, in other words, is in delivering a slick and exciting optical package that detracts from its deficiencies. All the while, that which made Star Trek one of the greatest franchises ever created--SUBSTANCE--is flushed down the toilet. This show couldn't be further away from real Star Trek.

A very slow burn compared to the punchy 45 min episodes telling one story with maybe some elements circling back around in later episodes for some world building or character arcs. \nPicard is so heavily reliant on nostalgia, would this series even work if it was a completely original crew? \nSir Patrick Stewart is undoubtably a fantastic actor and a powerful screen presence but he somehow seems out of place in all this, maybe that's the point but I'm really not sure at the time of writing this.\nDon't get me wrong, It's not all bad, there are some interesting elements/ concepts, the mystery of the Borg cube, the Romulan and star fleet conspiracy (as it seems), but it's just taking too damn long to get anywhere and I bet that when it does get interesting it will end on a cliffhanger (guaranteed) and the first half of season 2 will probably kill the momentum of the expected cliffhanger by doing flashbacks or something else equally distracting, boring and completely unnecessary.",

This is one of those shows you can't think about too much or you'll realize the plot holes, the things that made no sense, the characters that just vanished, the fact a handheld \"magic\" deus ex machine saved the day. There was so much cringe, I was embarrassed to watch this with friends, and I don't think anything happened to redeem it's self. The appearance of Captain Riker came close, but then again he was leading a fleet of 200 copy and paste ships. How lazy and unimaginative. The second to last episode uses a bunch of re-purposed Shutterstock footage. There was some intriguing ideas and they did \"Kill-off\" Picard which was bold, The final Data stuff, I was like eh, ok not really necessary but it's fine. My final thought is that it diverged too far from what we know Star Trek to be. Had it diverged and been better than old Star Trek, I wouldn't have complained, but it was not even close. I will say that one thing we definitely don't need is a TV-MA Star Trek. It's not working. I don't really care much about the crew, so I'm not really interested in a season 2.",

Picard goes from being a strong captain who everyone respects, to someone that is ushered around, disrespected, and abrasively spoken down to. He's useless! How many lives were saved by Picard in his career, thousands? When is Picard going to act like a leader again? When will someone respect him?\nThe characters and dialog are beyond  terrible. For example, Jeri Ryan returns to the series, where she randomly runs into Picard out in the infinite universe. Even though the meeting itself makes no sense, this presents an opportunity for discussion about the transition from Borg to human. Seven of Nine asks Picard if he feels human. Picard answers \"yes.\" What a deep philosophical discussion! A one word answer. Jeri Ryan was wasted by poor writing, and no wonder she mentioned panicking about the role in a podcast, and that the character was \"slangy\" and \"not Seven.\" I tend to trust Jeri Ryan's grasp of the character more than the writers who likely never watched the original show.\n\nThe writers seem more content with fluff long their own egos with empty political points that fall flat. The use of contemporary language, slang, and swearing is just embarrassing for Star Trek. We have an elf cutting a head off with a sword, and the graphic drilling out of an eyeball. The changes are a total regression, and the passage of time is no excuse.\n\nStar Trek was once about an ideal version of the future, where poverty, hunger, etc are eliminated. Instead, the series attempts to be \"dark,\" a total regression from Gene Roddenberry' a vision. \nI would like to cut Patrick Stewart some slack, since he was fantastic for many years as Picard, and he's nearly 80. It's not easy to do anything at that age. Unfortunately, his best acting days are well behind him. He's extremely slow with his lines, and seems content to destroy his one strong character.\n\nNeedless to say, I am beyond disappointed with this series! Nothing will fix this beyond hiring totally new writers, it's clear that it will never work \"as-is.\"",

Instead we are shown a dystopian society that is xenophobic and isolationist.  All the shows characters are deeply flawed in the most contrived ways imaginable.  Science, compassion, and knowledge has been replaced with senseless killing and treachery.  The writers have tried to make a poor imitation of the Expanse and have come of widely short of the goal.\n\nWhat's worse the show isn't very good.  Where the Expanse is compelling, Star Trek Picard is not.  We are five episode in and I don't care about the story or any of the new characters.  The pacing of the show is widely inconsistent.  It constantly changes from creeping along like a snail to completely manic.  Many of the plot devices are complete nonsense.  The Romulan Tal Shiar wasn't nefarious enough for this show so the writers came up with a even more \"Secret\" secret police the Zhat Vash.  Apparently the Romulans have some deep hatred for Synthetic life which we've never explored in any other version of Trek.  I'm guessing the story will unfold that the Romulans somehow create the Borg.  That or they just stole the playbook from Mass Effect and the Romulans had some long forgotten war with Synthetics.  Somehow the Romulans have managed to make the Federation complicit in this nonsense and Synthetic life is now banned in the Federation.  So much for all the progress we saw made with Data in TNG and the Doctor in Voyager.  \n\nThe few characters that we know from previous shows are nothing like we remember.  The Picard we meet in this show is nothing like the man who Captained the Enterprise.  Captain Picard was an extremely competent, commanding, highly moral man.  This \"JL\" that we follow in this show is a broken, frail, helpless old-man.  We are supposed to believe that Jean-Luc Picard gave up on mission to rescue the Romulans because he ran into resistance from Starfleet Command.  This is the same man who argued against Starfleet in Measure of a Man to secure the rights of Data.  This is the man who defied Admiral Haftel in Offspring to protect Lal from Starfleet.  This is the man who stood up to Admiral Satie in Drumhead to protect the rights of a half-Romulan crewman.  This is the man who arrested Admiral Pressman in the Pegasus when he illegally developed a cloaking device.  Clearly Jean-luc Picard is a man compromises his morals and gives up whenever he encounters resistance from above.        \n\nGood work Star Trek Picard.

Michael Chabon is one of my favorite writers. He writes excellent character driven stories that won him the Pulitzer Prize for fiction, and that type of writing and character development comes through in each episode like a peace to a larger puzzle. It really is much more interesting to see Picard battle his demons and face his regrets and atone for them than just throwing him on another star ship. \n\nThe series is very close to Batman The Dark Knight Returns in which an aging, retired hero must return to bring back balance and stand up for what's right while fitting into a world that defies him and doesn't really want him back. The character and his beliefs are pushed to the extreme, corruption of Star Fleet (Government) are pushed to their extreme. \n\nThe series isn't for those who have a short attention span or for those that don't like a slow burn build up of character development. I see a lot of people say there's so much talking (that's plot and setup). Also ohhh it goes no where....I watched 2 episodes and I don't know everything that's going to happen yet.

There are elements here that are interesting, but poorly executed, and a host of anti-Roddenberry themes like a Federation that seems to have lost its values and is increasingly isolationist and racist and bigoted. Stewart is a good actor, but he's written here as a sad, woeful and self-flagellating version of Picard which feels utterly wrong. Combined with the uncaring, isolationist Federation, and - by episode five - where Seven of Nine returns as a kind of angry freedom fighter (similar to the Maquis, but \"Ranger\"), and her mercy-killing of Icheb who has been captured, broken, dismantled without anesthesia, this doesn't feel in any way like Star Trek. Pacing runs from manic speed to iceberg slow, the known characters are warped dark versions, the new characters are angry and bitter, too many storylines are mashed together in a piecemeal way, and the backstories are all angsty and load blame for things on Picard. It's just not enjoyable, nothing seems earned on an emotional level, and the disjointed plotting makes it impossible to like any of the characters. It's just awful. The only purpose in torturing and killing Icheb was to give Seven a reason to revenge-kill a former lover (female, btw).  A scene between a new female character and her son is loaded with guilt and angst, blame and anger for \"abandoning him\" but I don't care because nothing has been built up to induce me to care. Romulans here are galactic refugees, some are friendly and others enemies, and there's tons of thickly laid guilt on Picard's side for \"failing them\" with loads of anger and hate on the Romulans' side... but it's never explained how the Romulan Empire couldn't evacuate/save themselves. Woven in to this mess are threads about Data having \"daughters\" who are like sleeper agents, some weird Romulan mythology tied to the Tal'Shiar (or an even more secret sect within that group), visits to random edgy dark planets to pick up a new character or save Maddox - who, by the way was an old TNG episode character who tried to have Data ruled as property so he could take him for experimentation. All of this just feels greasy and unpalatable.

Im happy some people like it but for me its a no.  Like I said so wanted to like this!!",

      "review": "This show simply tosses everything that made Trek unique and charming out of the window only to replace it with a depressing mirror image of 2020 politics.\n\nLike many tedious sci-fi shows these days it has a message, not the same positive message of hope that we saw in TNG where humanity has cast off it's ugly past and learned to transcend racism and inequality, but rather it presents a misserable mirror image of the political and economic issues that exist today.\n\nIt takes a huge leap back from gene roddenberry's whistful vision of the future and absolutely tares apart once beloved charactors.\n\nPicard himself seems to get torn a new asshole by every person he meets, regardless of if their friend or foe. Throughout the show you will get re-united with charactors from Treks rich history... to simply watch them die. Oh and it's established very early on that picard himself is on his last legs.\n\nIf you were to look at this as if it weren't a part of the Trek universe I would describe it as being mediocre, slow paced and somewhat boring. \n\nSave yourself the time and dissapointment, if you want to watch a show set in a dystopian future that is stylish, engaging, and has decent charactor development watch Amazons \"The Expanse\"",

How should it? I have never watched a show that bad. I am only watching it because it's Star Trek. But it pains me to see Patrick Steward's talent wasted. Even he is sub -par in this show. He's old now I get it, but it's the directors job to make up for his age and use it. Instead they make him seem obnoxious and out of place. The costumes are OK and the CGI is bad but I can live with that in a TV series. But the cutting, writing and most camerawork reminds me of \"The Room\" way too much. It's a bad show.",

His portrayal of Picard's transformation from a weathered and defeated optimist to a reinvigorated champion of the disenfranchised and threatened stands on its own, and is supported by a cast that makes Picard feel like a classic Greek epic.",

      "review": "Let's put our frustration of Kurtzman-era Trek into a different context.  Imagine a different timeline, where after the lukewarm reception to Enterprise, Star Trek went on its hiatus, but a different company made an offer to continue the franchise.  SyFy channel, having found success with Battlestar Galactica, was given the reigns to create a new Trek series.  Since modern Star Trek dictates that you can have significant historical changes and the present still turns out the same, Discovery and Picard then still come into existence, just not through CBS.  \n\nNow, anyone who has ever watched SyFy channel productions kind of knows the feel of their content.  Not even Battlestar Galactica was immune to their brand of dark, hokey science fiction, full of science magic and interpersonal drama, with questionable acting and writing at times, even if it was ultimately considered a success for the network.  It would be easy to imagine that if SyFy produced Star Trek, that we would see something very similar to what Alex Kurtzman and his gang have managed to come up with.\n\nWould I be frustrated with Star Trek if it were on SyFy?  I don't know.  I think I would still be frustrated that they don't have faith in the viewers to still want an intellectual and positive portrayal of that universe as we've previously come to know.  But I also think I would just accept that anything on SyFy channel is going to be of a certain production quality, and manage to enjoy it for what it is.  I did manage to go through the entire BSG series despite a lot of really slow periods of space politics, after all, and still come out of it with a generally positive opinion.\n\nMy frustration is just that this is mainline Star Trek.  CBS is charging us a subscription fee, on top of showing us ads, for something that is really not at a production value that we expect.  If you enjoy it, then I'm happy for you, but there are many of us who have a hard time accepting this rather low-brow level of storytelling.  \n\nThe show creators can say what they want, but I don't feel the profanity is necessary.  I don't think space vapes are necessary.  I don't think all the personal drama is of any relevance.  I don't think the action scenes are particularly exciting.  I don't feel anything for most of the characters, and even have a hard time associating Patrick Stewart as being Jean Luc Picard; most of my interest has mostly involved his housekeepers.  There is seemingly endless exposition, with a lot of junk science, and frankly just bad writing.  Combine that with graphic violence, particularly killing off a past character in a gruesome manner, in seemingly a spiteful retribution for a real-life disagreement with the original actor, to prevent him from ever being in the show in the future.  It's just petty.\n\nWith that being said, somehow this show is still better than Discovery.  That shouldn't be taken as a compliment, though, because being a step above garbage doesn't exactly put you on a pedestal.  Discovery's second season had some of the worst writing I've ever seen put to screen, with essentially no character development, ridiculous science that they should be embarrassed about, and endless drama between characters that I have no emotional attachment to, resulting in empty and pointless storytelling.  And yet, Picard is still better.  Barely.\n\nWe're essentially half-way through this show and almost nothing has happened.  It's a sad production for what was an amazing actor and character.  And I think it's rather mind-boggling to think that Patrick Stewart even rejected the initial pitch.  How bad could that version have been, if this is where we ended up?  Or better yet, why are these same people allowed to continue turning Star Trek into this insultingly bad franchise?\n\nWe want Star Trek.  We will happily pay for Star Trek.  But as many others are saying, this is not it.  This is shockingly bad, and brings genuine doubt into the future of Star Trek.  CBS will undoubtedly blame the viewers for its failure and put it on hiatus again, rather than accepting responsibility for hiring a bad team and trying to do it right.\n\nIf this is the best you can do, you can put it on cable with the rest of that dying industry.\n\n\nUPDATE:  It's over.  Thank goodness.  What an unmitigated disaster.  What a waste of film.  What a waste of time.  What a waste of potential.  Ten episodes where nothing happens, where the writers forgot their own plot, where you find yourself asking \"Wait, what?\" between nearly every commercial break.  Ten episodes of hyping a situation up and then completely dismissing it with some cockamamie conclusion that made it all moot.  Killing characters left, right, and center, desperately trying to force some kind of emotional reaction in the audience, and failing miserably every time, even when that character is Picard himself.  The only emotion I feel is disdain for the creators.  You failed, and you failed hard.",

I really wish they could do like the expanse or older Trek and try to break science in.....or at least not claim science at something way off like when the smartest character like when Dr Jurarti says there are 3 billion stars in the milky way...and that is about 300 times less than and a simple google search can fix the line. Many fans like me loved Trek and got into science. When they make dumb mistakes like that it's jarring.

I truly want to like it.  The acting is ok and the effects are average but the script and it's over arching themes are convoluted at best and at their worst divisive narratives that are now dated and inflammatory.  Remember the hope and wonderment that TNG brought to audiences.  We wanted to \"boldly go where no one has gone before\". This Trek has few cohesive story elements and instead of individual story's typically not dependent on the others this is a soap opera.  You must watch each episode to understand the episode that follows.  Picard is broken, old and regretful in a narrative that is far different from the captain we know and love.  It's out of character and sadly leads us on a path that isn't transformative as much as it is mundane.  Star Trek draws people in with hope, inclusion and a resolve to never sacrifice values and principles over hatred.  I've watched Discovery and what a mess that was!  I gave up simply because it to echoes the poor writing of Picard.  Scenes slip back and forth in time and Starfleet is a generic governmental mess concerned with being isolationist and boldly going inward.  This is not Star Trek it's CBS and make no mistake about Kurtzman's poor understanding of Star Trek. \nThe CBS app has little content, poor controls and was programmed by someone who hasn't looked at other superior streaming platforms.  I have to watch it on the CBS app in the U.S. which just adds to my misery.  I hope in a galaxy not too far away we will once again find the optimism that made Star Trek great.\nUpdate!!!!!\nI have reached the 6th episode and it's depressing.  One character is an alcoholic wreck, the other is a murderer and then there is some incidental characters of whom I have no interest in.  This is a dour universe with sets as generic as some of the characters, a ship with no personality or presence and sadly at the center of it all is Picard.  Picard is broken, regretful, angry and along with 7 of 9 are the antithesis of their former selves.  7 of 9 is bent on revenge.  How did it come to this?  Hope is always a key element in Star Trek.  This didn't need a Star Trek logo to draw people in.  It's just a really bad series. I've stopped watching.",

Yes, piecing together the flashbacks and the comments made by the characters was at times challenging and there are many mysteries and leads to be followed up but surely that is the whole point of thoughtful sci-fi?  Many of the episodes of TNG were relatively slow and thoughtful and they concentrated on one issue and searched for a resolution.  The difference here is that across 10 episodes you can deal with more (as well as catch up on the 17/18 years since Star Trek Nemesis).  I have no problem with the series not being based on a starship called the Enterprise.  DS9 was an excellent series based a space station central to the galactic politics of the day.  Whether people like it or not Star Trek Picard does move the timeline forward and we see the alpha and beta quadrants in some distress following the events of Romulus and Mars.  The portrayal of the powers that be in the Federation and Starfleet is not necessarily bad and they clearly still aspire to being utopian societies but clearly confidence has taken a knock.  Again, the events of the previous 25 years with the Dominion War would have also had a devastating effect on the morale and confidence of all the species in the alpha and beta quadrants. So well done to the writers for very carefully thinking through what the galaxy of the Star Trek Universe would be like in 2399 and setting the scene for Picard to re-emerge from retirement and save the galaxy once again! I can't see how that in any way conflicts with the optimistic tone that was set for Star Trek by Gene Roddenberry all those years ago.  It relates to today in that as everyone has said we can't just sit back and assume the world will get better.  We have to work at it and as a result we have to hope that the world will get better.  That's the point of good sci-fi and certainly Star Trek. Well done again.",

It ignores events and canon set up in previous series, which makes it very hard to be believable and hence get into the show due to the multiple plot holes\n\nThis show feels like the creators and the writers never really watched Star Trek the Next Generation.\n\nThe only positive is I think Patrick Stewart's acting is still as good as it ever was, but unfortunately the development of Picard as a character is not true to that of the character we saw in Star Trek the Next Generation.\n\nReally disappointed :(",

      "review": "The writing is severely lacking here. I get that the show runners want to take Star Trek in a new direction and i am all for that, but in order to do that, you have to respect what came before. Picard and Discovery suffer the same problem, in that they start from a completely unrecognisable point. Abrams' Star Trek was mediocre at best and CBS had absolutely no reason to try and tie Picard into that timeline, yet they attempted to shoe-horn the whole Romulan Supernova into the prime universe when they simply could have ignored it. The result literally wipes out half of the map that Star Trek spent 50 years drawing.\nThe first Episode is OK in terms of plotting and pacing - There's a mystery that needs solving and Picard is the man for the Job, but there are several signs that the writers didn't do their homework. Jurati states that Synths are outlawed by \"Galactic Treaty\". Galactic? Did Senator Palpatine sign off on this? Wrong Franchise. The federation occupies a very small corner of the galaxy so, unless they sent ships to every planet in the galaxy, I think not.\nI know this is nit-picking but it is very telling that the writers don't fully understand what they are getting into.\nEpisode 2 was just bad from start to finish. I can suspend my disbelief when an Irish Actress play a Romulan whio now lives in France. She's a talented actress and her accent doesn't get in the way of her performance, but to exclaim \"Cheeky Feckers\", an Irish slang term, was just nonsense. If anything, The Romulan (Alien from another planet hundreds of light-years away) who now lives in France could easily have uttered something in French and gotten away with it. Cheeky Feckers was a choice made by the actor and the Director should have shut that down on the spot.\nBy all means Star Trek, Explore brave new worlds but try a little better to make it look like you know what you are doing.",

The M rating is one reason why I'm not interested in Trek Discovery and for some reason the producers seem to think an M rating will result in better ratings?  Not for me and my house.  If they cleaned things up a bit to give it a TV14 rating I could give this a 4 star rating.  But watching a Trek show shouldn't be like watching sailors talk.  This only distracts from the show and it's sad that they've decided to go this route for such a once great franchise.  Picard himself even looks a little out of place with the Admiral's remark.

The show is now mostly comprised of cardboard characters delivering poorly written (and already inconsistent) exposition to the point where even character traits that would normally be used as performance hints to the actors are now delivered directly as dialogue by the characters themselves. Every scene is now also written from the point of the script writer with a complete disregard for what the characters know or might be feeling; if the story demands something, the characters will immediately blurt out that they now feel or think in a way that facilitates it, character or race traits be damned.

So, the take away from this is that it is not Star Trek. Shun it. Ignore it. It will go away in time and then, maybe, we can actually have Star Trek again, despite Alex Kurtman's best efforts.",

They only have two episodes out and you already know exactly what's going to happen during the rest of the series. I guess this is a great series if you like having every little piece of the plot fed to you like a parent feeding his infant. 6) The sets and the majority of the costumes could be for any Sci-Fi show.

The show is constantly trying to allude to something but it never does it in a subtle way. The dialogue is poor and it doesn't seem to fit the characters. As someone who is used to the lore and history of trek, all of the characters feel undeveloped and historical and cultural backgrounds completely ignored. Romulans for example have years worth of history on the screen yet we are met with very human Romulans (complete with very human accents). \n\nThis moves me on to my next point. Picard himself feels like a shadow of the noble man we knew and loved from the bridge of the enterprise and even if this is perhaps part of a plot device I'm not aware of. It makes it difficult to watch a programme about possibly the greatest star trek character whom feels nothing like the character we know and love. \n\nThe other issues are part of the way the show has been produced. The vaseline blurred edges of the screen, the appalling editing and the bizarre over the top cinematography (complete with random pointless camera angle cuts) make it hard to focus on the sub par plot.\nThere is a lack of depth and lack of philosophical engagement that trek and Jean luc the character used to bring to the table and although Patrick Stewart said in an interview that this was a darker trek for a darker world we live in, I believe now more than ever we need the positive, morality seeking, exploration and guidance of Captain Jean Luc Picard.",

I don't write reviews or publically comment on shows, but star trek was such a part of my childhood and my life that I feel compelled to in this case. From what I've seen there is no care taken with the narrative or production of this show. It seems to just be thrown together from a collection of loose ideas because there is a general direction to the narrative, but the way it's presented, the sets and the visuals tell me it's was never really scrutinised before they produced it. Like publishing a first draft. \n\nI get the direction Patrick Stewart mentioned, in that this isn't the world of ST:Next-Gen, this is a Star Fleet that has \"lost its way\" so to speak, as a commentary to what's going on in the world. I get that and accept that. Sure there are plot holes, but if you've been around star trek long enough you can sort of fill those in yourself with benefit of the doubt thinking. Granted in Star Trek-style they SHOULD be explained with \"techno-jargon\" that is based in scientific theory or pseudo-science in some cases.\n\nYet what gets me is the visual style, which seems to be lifted directly from ST: Discovery, set just about a century before Next-Gen and nearly 150 years before Picard, yet the shuttles to get around look like they're right out of Desconvery's hanger. The Enterprise-D has a hull so dark it might as well be made out of steel, making the ship look more like the combat-oriented Enterprise-E, rather than a ship built for peacetime ambassadorial duties . 10 forward looks extraordinarily sterile, dark and gloomy for a place that is supposed to be a place for relaxation and socialisation. The Daystrom Institute scene has exposed air ducts in the background, Starfleet has been travelling the stars for more than two centuries, and apparently, humans have never figured out better air vents than that. Furthermore, from what we've seen of the preview scenes as well as episode 2, human starships are as dark, sterile and gloomy as a borg cube. No seriously, compare the light levels in that borg cube and the scenes of any human starship, if anything the borg cube might have better lighting.\n\nI get it visual style is an artistic choice, and there is a certain element of poetic license with that, but honestly, this is just lazy and slapdash, relying more on post effects, lens flare and light rays to make it seem futuristic and visually appealing. I can't help but be pulled out of my immersion of the story by that those very elements, and when I'm pulled out of that immersion, how can I enjoy a show that already has pacing issues?",

In Picard we see a Star Trek for the times we live in. TNG was about optimism. Utopia. It\u00b4s the 90's in the end of the Cold War with the fall of the Berlin Wall. But you know what?  No one explained to us how to reach that Utopia. Now we have new challenges to face and a generation that seems to be repeating the mistakes of the past. Perhaps this is why Patrick Steward decided to return as Picard.  We see a character that realizes he can\u00b4t just let injustice go by. He can't just sit still in retirement while a new generation faces such major issues. I can see the potential in Picard. I can see how it can become a though provoking series.

I was not impressed with the first season of Star Trek: Discovery, but as that show has improved I have come on board with it.\n\nI was concerned with the pre-release comments that suggested that Picard was possibly going to be yet another release where politics and agendas were being placed above plot - but I needn't have been.  The first episode suggests that the politics will be included in the plot, as was usually the case in Trek's past, and that the story is going to be a logical continuation from TNG.\n\nSadly, modern Star Trek has seemed to turn its back on the original premise of showing an example of the utopian society that Gene felt humans could work towards creating, which knocks back the star grade a little.  Depending on how that plays out I may have to revise the grade downwards.  Trek was not, and should not, be \"depressing, dark and gritty\".",

Would Picard suffer the same fate as Disco had?\n\nWell from the first episode alone it's impossible to tell. My initial reaction to episode one was as follows.\n\nEnterprise - Check\nStar Trek Music - Check\nPicard And Data -  Check\nPoker In Ten Forward - Check\n\nOff the bat I was very impressed not only be the visuals but the subtle callbacks to previous generations. The story progressed at a modest pace and stayed consistent throughout. Although, and perhaps it's just me but did anyone else think that data's Starfleet Dominion War Uniform look a bit cheap? \n\nAs far as the new characters it's impossible to tell wether or not they'll work and of course time will tell all. But I think it's a promising start.\nStar Trek Picard will undoubtably have an easier time than discovery thanks in no small part to the returning cast. However thanks to the fact that this new series is set in the 25th century the change in ship designs and tech is explainable through progress and will tick less people off than discovery did with their sleek looking ships.\n\nAll in all we're off to a good start.

It appears to be akin to DS9 in that it's taking a more critical look at the federation but doesn't look to be trying to make it into an evil-empire. Rather I think it's exploring the notion of how war and unexpected challenges can led people to not live up to their ideals.

Fortunately, that's only episode one... and, an extensive knowledge of Star Trek lore already pays off in pretty big ways: The whole thing is a lot easier to buy-in to if you know Bruce Maddox from TNG - both the episode in which he is most relevant, but also the other contextual dialogue references to him throughout the series. It's not must-have knowledge, but it adds credibility to the goings-on of the show. \n\nPatrick Stewart is exactly what you'd expect from a retired Admiral Jean-Luc Picard in his 90s; they do a good job continuing the natural course of his character development. I'm not sure how he'd be perceived by people who aren't familiar with the character (especially late TNG/the movies), but he's who he starts to become at the end of All Good Things (the last episode of TNG), and the first time we see him is absolutely 100% a call back to both that moment and also Nemesis (the last time we saw him on-screen) at the same time. He still maintains the natural authority and command presence he's renown for (and it's helpful that, even though he wields no real power any more, he's literally a living legend to everyone), but it's also pretty apparent that he's well past his prime, and more or less has nothing left to live for initially. They've really amplified Picard's moral authority (like you'd expect from a bitter old man), but they've also double downed on his self-doubt, uncertainty, and Picard-style brooding/mourning.\n\nAll-in-all, I'm glad it's finally here, and optimistic about how they'll play this out.",

(Although I do think Anson Mount was excellent as Captain Pike and they ought to develop a series with him).

It shares no values of the imagination of Star Trek by Gen Roddenberry like an optimistic depiction of the future where mankind has defeated old problems. Furthermore there are illogical plot points if you know Star Trek canon....for example why does the Romulan EMPIRE need ships of the Federation to evacuate their homeworld.

Then have 1.2  commence 14 years later.  There is little drama to the first half (consuming 1/2 it's running time! remember looking at the timer and thinking, crap, just get on with it) being expository for events never shown on screen and about pretty much nothing.  Compare this to the Mandalorian which in half the running time grabbed an audience.

It has a look and feel of following an old long-lost, yet fondly remembered, friend as he has a form of awakening to what and who he once was. This series appears to be a child of a number of \u2018Questioning Starfleet' episodes as well as \u2018Insurrection' and \u2018Nemesis' and so retreads some ideas brought up in TNG, and indeed DS9 in many places, about the direction and moral compass of Starfleet and the Federation. In comparison, I watched and intensely disliked Discovery until they injected Pike and Spock into Season 2 which started to redeem the direction. Picard, to its credit, has none of the ham-fisted, canon-retconning/ignoring, disdain for the franchise that Discovery Season 1 gave me from The first episode. Picard Ep1, however, was a joy and has me looking forward to where they will go with this bold (and not so new) direction. I must add that the ability to only comment about, and rate,  the entire first season when having only seen Ep1 seems to be a failing on RTs side, as commenting on, and rating, the episode would make more sense.",

Patrick Stewart said as much when first announcing the series, and Discovery has shown us that Kurtzman's brand of Star Trek has a vastly different theme, tone, pace, palette, and narrative style than all of Rick Berman's productions (for better or worse). In saying that, Picard is an improvement over Discovery. Yes, one could argue that the plot points surrounding Dahj are somewhat uneven and contrived, and while the ending of episode is meant to be monumental, it is a bit clich\u00e9 (if not unimpressive and underwhelming). On the other hand, the commanding and emotive presence of Stewart's late-in-life Picard is very appealing and attractive, and I appreciate that even after experiencing great loss, Picard is still a man driven by an unshakeable moral compass and sense of duty. I also enjoyed the subtle gratitude and devotion of the two Romulans working at his side at Chateau Picard; I think simple beats like this are more beneficial to Star Trek than heavy exposition, convoluted storylines, or derivative action sequences. The first episode also benefits from beautiful cinematography and an outstanding score. As long as the production team focuses on unpretentious arcs driven by relationships and character (and plot points that truly honor franchise canon as well as Roddenberry's vision), I think Picard will undoubtedly be an amazing Star Trek series.",

I think watching The Next Generation growing up helped me to be a better person. It was a show about morality, about doing the right thing. It was't about killer aliens and special effects, even if it had some of those and they might have been what originally lured you in.\nNobody doubted whether he could reprise the role. It's who he is. My doubts, however, are whether the supporting cast could be as strong as the Enterprise D crew. The darker and more action oriented Star Treks were never as good as the ones where Picard and his lot were going around the universe stirring up random trouble, or inadvertently creating a sentient holographic Mark Twain with the Holodeck. Special Effects have come a long way since TNG, but they're a dime a dozen and no longer what we care about. \nIt seems the new series picks up on the lowest point of The Next Generation's storyline from the last feature film, Nemesis. However, it also takes from the final episode of the TV series, which was arguably better than any of the feature films.  Maybe this is a chance for redemption. Time will tell.\nThe premier episode was pretty good! My only complains are the action scenes.. Sir Patrick Stewart clearly can't run, so don't cut away constantly to try to cover it up. Put him in a 24th century wheelchair or Segway or something. And that explosion, and him suddenly just waking up at home, unharmed? I felt like I might have blacked out or skipped some parts. It was a little hurried toward the end, like they had to edit a lot out. Should have been a longer episode or split between two. Other than that it's off to a pretty good start!

The new characters aren't at all compelling so far. The dialogue was just bad - the Romulan who told Picard he needed to \"be the Captain they remember\" might as well have winked at the audience it was so on the nose. Costuming was dreadful, since when does Picard wear a shirt with a tie in the 25th century, not even an attempt to make it look like the future. The alien make-up was the only redeeming feature and even then, the latest movies and television series just can't seem to get Vulcans/Romulans ears quite right.\n\nBut the real problem with the show is the premise. I don't buy that the Federation - which has gone to the assistance of their enemies *numerous* times would give up and simply refuse to help the Romulans during a crisis. And the Jean-Luc Picard who I grew up watching, in the event of the rescue's fleet destruction, would be on subspace in a flash calling Admiral Riker, Admiral Janeway, Captain Worf - who'd then call Chancellor Martok, First Minister Kira, Captain Dax - and before you know it a new rescue fleet has been assembled.  I simply cannot buy that Jean-Luc Picard was faced with a challenge of such magnitude that he simply gave up and went to mope around his family vineyard for 20 years.\n\nMore to the point, I am uninterested in any story universes in which my heroes, who have faced such enormous challenges in the past and held onto their ideals, have now given up and exiled themselves to grow bitter and angry. Star Trek has always been about optimism and hope and so far Picard has neither.\n\nI'll update my review if the situation improves but so far this looks like another dreary bleakquel taking itself too seriously, what has happened to the fun, intelligent sci-fi franchise I loved?",

What I've seen from this series thus far is that visually it's been able to continue the physical look of the Next Gen/DS9/VOY era but using the same/familiar elements and aging them about 20 years as the timeline follows.  Even the sounds work as they are familiar and enhanced to grow with the time frame.  So far everything I've seen in terms of lore being followed and honoured makes me very happy.  Star Treks acting has flared of brilliance over the various series but at the same token if the surrounding world doesnt make me feel like I'm watching star trek... then I cant believe it actually is.

I wanted this to be good, instead it's just more of the same junk they've been doing since the 2009 reboot. Lazy writing, poor pacing, even the film editing had obvious errors that wouldn't fly on a show with one tenth the budget power episode.\nPros: Patrick Stewart's acting is on point\nData and Picard playing cards (though it's just a dream, so it's also a let down) \nThe actress who plays the AI scientist at the institute gave an amazing performance though she had the worst line in the show (clone a positronic brain with intact memories from a single neuron is just patently ridiculous and the most egregious Kurtzmanism in the show)\n\nCons: Horrible writing; also according to the credits there were 5 writers for the first episode, and boy did it feel like it. The exchange at the end where they introduce the Twin clone, is so horribly awkward. It felt like a 5th graders first attempt at writing a romance novel, if all they had to go off were the front covers of a bunch of Harlequins from the 80s.\nBad pacing and editing : There are 18 producers that is ridiculous, the show looks like a bunch of kids fighting over how to do a group project in school, and then storming off to their desks to do their work on their own. There cuts that make no sense. The events of the first episode felt stretched out for the first few minutes as if they were trying to fill time to make up their network block, then from the introduction of Dhaj onward everything was so compressed it destroyed any sense of discovery or reveal. Realistically they could've made the events of this first episode a full season arc, and it would've at least had emotional playoffs, instead all this episode established is new characters are one dimensional and don't expect anyone to stick around long.\n\nAll in all this is the death knell for ST. I have JJ two films to get good, couldn't be bothered to even watch the last one. I gave Kurtzman 3 episodes of STD, before I gave up on that. I was willing to give Picard the benefit of the doubt because they got so many of the old cast on board for cameos, but if this is indicative of the quality of story they are going to be putting out I won't be watching.",

I can confirm that this is NOT The Mandalorian, but better than Star Trek Discovery so far (which isn't really saying much). I would have made the plot less confusing, and left most (if not all) questions unanswered... for now.

I'm fine with a more character-driven and earthier premier/show, a lot of exposition and a slow-burn to explore this universe and meets its people 20 years on before 'going back out into the cold'. We were warned it would be different. Sir Patrick is a legend and I believe his genius along with the writers will hold most sceptics through the bits they don't like as they adjust and find patience with this kind of story-telling. And to have Data back in some form, yes!--a compelling plot connected to some of the best episodes of TNG. I can't wait for the next. I hope there are many more to come.

With that said, I am impressed with this show so far.

If you watched TNG and the following movies, every note I watched in this premiere is genuine to the character and all of the motivations are clear to me for him. This is a man that has lived his own life over and over again (thanks Q and random alien probe), and even an entire other life as well, who has experienced love and loss we can only imagine, and honestly, this is where science fiction shines. This is not an enterprise bubble gum establishment show, and this i think is part of the tone of the reviews i am reading, The reviewers seem to not understand the character and in turn the universe.\n\nI CAN NOT WAIT for the next episode.\n\nAnd knowing it already is greenlit for a second season, really shows how the showrunners understand what they have made because this show is really amazing already in my opinion.\n\nBut honestly, I am a person that you can not talk to Star Trek about in the car with, simply because I will get into an accident (and have... 3 times...)

This continues the optimistic side of Trek without pretending that getting there won't mean dealing with challenges and setbacks. Other lovely details: his portrayal of being a now aged Picard who has to manage physical limitations while trying to make the world a better place.\n\nYou might hear some criticisms like \"romulans can't spit acid\" (perhaps they've never heard of cyanide capsules) or about the character having parts of herself activate like lightning. Fortunately the writers did not feel the need to hold our hands and explain everything in episode one. They've avoided anal retentiveness: story and themes are more important than debates as to whether fictional technology set 30 years in the future after TNG can exist or not, especially when that tech is a mystery that is set up to be explained in future episodes.

What happened with billions of them?

Having grown up with Star Trek as a child of the 80's, even to this day, at least once a year I re-watch TNG, DS9, VOY and ENT. It never gets old. With Picard, we are treated to a wonderfully rich backstory that is TNG with Sir Patrick Stewart reprising his iconic role.\n\nI am VERY pleased that everything I loved about Captain Picard in TNG and the TNG movies is back in this new show and Patrick has clearly given an immense amount of attention and passion to lovingly bring this beloved character back to life for one last adventure.\n\nThe cinematography is fantastic! The acting is superb and the nods to the characters TNG backstory and roots is fabulous for those of us who grew up with, and have a deep affection for this character, as well as the others who are making cameo appearances.\n\nI've only had the good fortune of watching the first episode thus far and I can honestly say, no TV show has been this hotly anticipated for me ever! With the usual distractions (fiddling about on my phone or PC while something is on in the background), for the first time in the last 10 years I was completely glued to my TV screen with wonder and awe.\n\nI wish the cast and crew of Star Trek Picard all the best and I know before I've even seen the rest of the first season that I am going to love it. I cannot wait to see how this story unfolds and am thrilled that there is a Trek show that so strongly resonates with me on a level that reminds me why I fell in love with the original Next Generation-era TV shows in particular.\n\nSir Patrick Stewart - you legend!",

I think the director and editors really need to pump the breaks at times.

And as a trekkie, I love the references to ST canon; everything from Data's daughter (which I'm going back to watch that episode on TNG), to Commander Maddox's wild obsession with making Data clones (another TNG episode that questions if Data is sentient). This feels like a sci-fi series with Star Trek tones. It's not a typical Trek like TNG, Voyager, Enterprise, or DS9. So be prepared for that.

It succeeded handily on both counts. Sir Patrick Stewart has fully re-embodied the character of Jean-Luc Picard (albeit with an extra helping of regret), and the supporting cast is magnificent. Jeff Russo\u2018s score is gorgeous, and the production values are top notch.

A great peak in at the life of one of our favorite captains that maintains the core of who he was when we last saw him 20 years earlier, still hopeful, willing to help anyone, particularly the crew he sees as family. But also acknowledges that time has past, he's 94 years old, he's long retired.",

      "review": "I think the series is off to a great start, if this the first taste of what the series has to offer, we (audience) are about to embark on a great adventure. The first episode looks and feels like we are watching a movie. The cinematography, story and editing are pleasing to look at. Some viewers are saying this series is saying Star Fleet went rogue, I would not say that at all.  The audience must remember you are looking at things through the jaded lens of Picard (again focused on Picard) which has been influenced by what happened to him during his tenure in Star Fleet. To setup an interesting story the camera will be forced to step away from Picard from time to time to setup the other story arcs, these other story arcs will influence Picard later in the series. Does this look like the other Star Trek, the answer is no, it is better because now instead of the story being completed in 1hr it will now be completed over the series which will give the producers more time to explore in detail different story elements. I can not wait for the rest of the cast to be revealed and introduced! Also, Star Trek has been a series that takes current day events and overlays them in the Sci-Fi universe of Star Trek which I think they are off to a good start. Let's Boldly go where TNG has not gone before and explore the inner depths of Captain (Admiral) Picard! I am interest in seeing what will be revealed later in the series and the many other it may have. Live long and prosper!",

      "review": "Well, it's certainly not Star Trek in any way, shape or form, but as generic, poorly written, just about watchable sci-fi, it has some promise. It's very slow, has far too much exposition, Stewart's not playing Picard, more more like Charles Xavier. He's chewing the scenery a little too much acting wise. I felt like I was watching a 10th sequel X-Men movie. The bits without Dhaj in aren't bad, but the whole thing goes down the toilet when she turns up. Picard's Romulan house staff are just humans with pointy ears. It's all very slick, expensive, and admittedly looks lovely. While it's far far better than STD, it still ain't Star Trek in any way.\n\nThe opening dream sequence with Data wearing a First Contact uniform aboard the Enterprise D is horribly wrong. I suppose you could explain it away by it being a dream, but it just looked like a schoolboy error made by someone who doesn't know what they're doing.",

      "review": "Some might dislike the darker tone, but Star Trek has always been about interrogating our current state and applying aspirational values to that milieu. The changes in the world of Star Trek mirror our own. The '90s were a time of naive optimism and earnest social progress. Contrast with today and you see the rise of nationalist fascism across the world. Picard is the perfect character to embody this existential crisis. I feel as he does, but there's hope. \n\nIt's such a treat to to see the characters and universe I grew up with in the '90s get another chance at expanding the story with an unprecedented level of production and writing talent. Every scene has some kind of world building revealing a depth of knowledge about the Star Trek canon. I can't wait to see where this leads.",

      "review": "Patrick Stewart's Post-Starfleet Picard is aged, bitter, disillusioned and resigned to be a footnote in late 24th century Federation history, living out the rest of his life on his family's vineyard.  Decades have past, and his faith in the institutions he used to represent have wavered, due to a policy that stood to put pragmatism over compassion.  It's at this point in his life that a visitor comes to his vineyard, seeking his help, drawn to him by some unknown instinct.  \n\nThis sets the stage for the newest incarnation of the Star Trek franchise, a show that will examine the events at the turn of the 25th century, the state of affairs of the Federation society, the aftermath of the Hobus supernova on the Romulan Star Empire (as depicted in the 2009 Star Trek film by J.J. Abrams,) and Jean-Luc Picard's place in it all.\n\nThe pilot episode, \"Remembrance,\" does a great job of setting the stage, giving enough exposition about the past few decades without ignoring the driving motivations that will see Picard leave the Vineyard to unravel a mystery that promises to tie many of the main themes of the show into a compelling narrative that will appeal to many fans of the franchise and new fans alike.\n\nUnlike its sister series Star Trek: Discovery, Picard seems to flow at a more deliberate pace, more concerned with deeper characters than driving action set-pieces, though there is still plenty of action in the pilot episode to be had.  It continues the legacy of Star Trek: The Next Generation, without being beholden to the episodic formula, or need to fill time in a TV season with filler.\n\nI recommend the show, obviously.  But more than that, I recommend that you actually watch it yourself and make up your own mind on it.  Especially if you're a fan of the character, and the franchise.  Please don't allow the disgruntled youtube gatekeepers to determine for you what is or is not REAL Star Trek, that is only something you can do for yourself.  Personally, I am excited to see the rest of the season, and hope that it can live up to its pilot, if not improve upon it.\n\nThanks.",

This is a melodramatic Dystopian soap opera that is appropriating the name Star Trek. No disrespect to the acting ability of Sir Patrick Stuart but my love for Picard is not enough to make me ignore the horrible direction in which they are taking trek. Star Trek is meant to be a utopian view future where we've moved past our shortcomings as a race, to face new adversity not be mired in the past, this show is an insult to all that has come before it. (With the exception of discovery which has the exact same problem)",

Forgettable characters if you can call them that at all and mystery boxes with no payoff at all. And that's just, when you don't compare the show to its source material. Then it gets downright insulting. Especially the ending is a slap in the face of everyone, who was a Star Trek Fan before 2009.\n\nAlso the show isn't suitable for a younger audience (traditionally Star Treks core demographic). Lots of graphic violence, swearing and sexually charged dialogue. Also some weird messages, like: Putting women in charge of an organization automatically makes it incredibly racist, sexist an xenophobic and every queer character has to be a psychpath. Weird, considering, it was marketed as a progressive show.",

      "review": "This production looks and sounds amazing, in ways The Next Generation simply could not for its time.  Additionally, it is a wonderful continuation of Jean-Luc Picard's story, that in the first episode alone demonstrates that Picard is unwilling to betray his own moral principles, even if it means living in a life of isolation and depression.  Picard does an amazing job of giving Patrick Stewart the same kind of latitude to explore the character and make the same powerful Picard-esque soliloquies and speeches TNG fans came to love as part of his character.\n\nBecoming involved with Dajh immediately ignites a flame within Picard that very quickly re-ignites the spark we have all come to know and love from the good captain.  Based upon what we have already seen it is quite clear that this story, is going to take Picard to places he, in his solitude; and us as fans could never have expected - and I look forward to seeing the rest of it!!!!",
