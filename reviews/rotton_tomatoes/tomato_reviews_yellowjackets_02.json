      "review": "One of this show's greatest strengths is also perhaps its greatest weakness. Every show of prominence needs a hook to gain a viewer's attention. J.J. Abrams put it best in his discussion of the \"mystery box.\" It's what drives the show forward. It's reason for being. In the case of Yellowjackets, it's been the question of \"what happened in the woods\" that would drive the girls to be who they eventually became. Yet, one other lingering question, alluded to in the first season, is what extent of their actions was influenced by the supernatural. The writer's hesitation to fully embrace the supernatural leaves me, and subsequently the characters in a state of limbo. Stephen King is a master of this medium. His material makes it abundantly clear from the start that the supernatural drives the madness in his characters (usually has some form of metaphor). The rest of the story usually focuses on the characters decisions to rectify the situation (sometimes to horrific consequences).\n\nMy issues aside all the strengths of the first season carry over into the second season. There are some absolutely captivating performances from all those involved that only help to bolster the story and really keep you invested. Plus, I would be remiss if I didn't mention the ending of episode 2. This has to be the single best use of a Radiohead song in a TV show or movie... Ever. The scene is disturbing and haunting and the song lends to a sense of foreboding that can't help but leave you with the feeling that there's no turning back.",

Some of the effects are a little janky, especially the green screen when out in the wilderness. And the pacing is so slow it's even less than a crawl. I spent two seasons watching the script tell me how crazy the girls got while being out in the woods, yet it shows next to none of it outside of one scene. And, I have to say, that scene comes out of nowhere without really any buildup or reasoning, they just suddenly go insane. The script and writing really is 90% of my issue with the show. It's an interesting premise executed relatively poorly. I don't get the hype around this show. \n\nAlso, season 2 actually rounds things out quite nicely. I'd have happily had it end here.

Because I didn't begin watching it until the 2nd season was already out, I was able to jump right back in. I'M SO GLAD I CONTINUED WATCHING!! Season 2 was a delicious surprise (okay, poor wording haha). Sure, the audience is still WTF-ing throughout, but as Season 2 unfolds, more and more pieces (yuck) come together making it will worth the watch for anyone who invested time into Season 1. \n\nThe entertainment factor is dead-on! I don't mind the ambiguity of not knowing whether or not \"it\" is an external force or something internal within each character due to everything endured and all that was done in order to survive. But there are still so many WTF's left to be deflowered! I look forward to Season 3. With many new and old questions begging to be answered, I hope Showtime delivers and that they clean the storyline up a bit and patch up some plot holes to make season 3 worth 5 stars.

The visuals this season were amazing, the character dynamics were so well done, and the character growth (whether it be redemption or corruption) was fantastic. And this season was also so heartbreaking as well, with Shauna's pregnancy, and Crystal's death, and that last scene between Coach Ben and Natalie... the emotions felt so much more raw this season than the last, and this season made me love this show even more.

Lottie I am still not completely sold on in either timeline, but maybe that is how we are supposed to feel about her. \nShe is bat shit crazy and dangeous, and those lemming-like characters whose names I still don't know threaten to bring down the entire group with their Lottie worship.  \n\nI am guessing they will be food eventually, but I thought the girl whose hunt and eating we saw in S1, E1 was a blonde!

Didn't see much of the yellowjackets together in the first half, allowing for greater development of said consequences individually. I enjoyed the sccene of them together in the latter half. Overall good escalation of desperation in the scenes set in the past.\n\nPossible spoilers:\nI enjoyed the Shauna scenes in the present, mainly because I liked getting to see more of Callie (with hopes that she plays more of a role in the third season) and the breath of fresh air that Jeff's intentionally humorous scenes were. Shauna's madness was definitely there in the first season as far as I can remember, but they don't let us forget about it this season. I also just love Melanie Lynsky's voice. Speaking of madness, those last scenes set in the present during the final episode required greater suspension of disbelief than the rest of show did, which is saying a lot. Walter was an interesting addition to the cast, that fits almost too well with Misty, but his acting is good and the scenes are entertaining so I'm find with it. I was expecting Tai's sleepwalking to get worse in the second half, but it's almost forgotten, which might not be a plot hole assuming thats because Tai was acting in favor of what her \"other side\" wanted, but it threw me off because I thought the sleepwalking flare-ups were associated with stress levels - and I can't imagine her stress subsided after that crash. Coach Ben's increasing distance from the rest of the group was well-developed throughout season, though I didn't dig the transitions to his pre-flight-crash scenes - the scenes themselves were meaningful, and honestly the transitions were probably made to be intentionally jarring since the reason he was experiencing these \"flashbacks\" is because he felt increasingly out of place with the group, so I don't actually mind it.",

This season also finally shows how the team ended up driven into cannibalism and how they realized that it was their only chance for survival. In the present timeline the survivors of the plane crash are force to accept their traumas and face the wilderness once again with a tragic ending.\n\nThe most remarkable element of this season and show is the acting. Both cast, teen and adults, deliver outstanding performances with Melanie Lynskey, Sophie N\u00e9lisse, Christina Ricci, Samantha Hanratty, and Sophie Thatcher taking the spotlight. The soundtrack selection for each episode is spot on adding more emotions and completing the atmosphere already created by the scrip and the cast's members. The only flaw that can be found on this season is the writing. While it's written in a way that the timelines are easy to understand, by moments they're adding more information without answering previous questions first. It also jumps from one event to another leaving the girls trauma response into a surface level overusing the \"I don't wanna talk about it\" feeling. This can hurt the series on the long run since some details will be left behind in order to wrap up the story.\n\nWith a lot yet to be revealed this triller drama is far from being over. With a third season confirmed we can only hope for at least one more season to give the series the proper ending. The season finale leaves both timelines in a cliffhanger rising the expectations for what will come next. This is the perfect show for people who want to get started into cannibalism content since it doesn't features the usual amount of gore yet.",

That said, it goes so fast that the big question is, what's left in the story for future season? We still have more than one year in the past storyline after all (and season since to be limited to 3 months maybe).\n\nThe present storyline has its up and down, if we get some new interesting characters, we spend too much time with the main protagonists separated with stories that don't feel as urgent as the first season. One storyline with police officers was frustrating to get through. Eventually the finale bring all the gang together put doesn't go high enough to make for the drag of the whole season.",

We continue to see their terrifying shared history as they were stranded in the Canadian Rockies for 19 months; and then wound up resorting to all sorts of terrifying ordeals and horrifying behaviors; including orgies, witchcraft and cannibalism to survive.  We see all that, and then we see how those ordeals from the past affect them as middle aged women trying (pretty unsuccessfully) to reacclimate themselves to normal civilian life!  It's very much a \"cursed scenario\" thriller; where all the characters are under some sort cloud; much like a classic Greek Tragedy; or Final Destination and Drag Me to Hell; etc.  And it's also a you-can't-escape-from-your-past type show; like I Know What You Did Last Summer or Prom Night.... and you can't!  Try as these women might!  You can't escape your past; and you can't escape your destiny; and we see those themes play out over and over again on this show!  It's like the Yellowjackets are perennially caught in quicksand; and the more they struggle; the more things get worse and worse!  This season includes scenes of the actual cannibalism that happened back in the Canadian Rockies; and some of the other alluded-to horrors that were just hinted in Season 1!  Also Elijah Wood shows up in Season 2, becoming part of the regular cast; reuniting with his Ice Storm (1997) co-star Christina Ricci; once again playing her love interest, like he did the last time.  We see more about Lottie; her supernatural powers; and her growing cult of followers (that Natalie becomes a part of) at Camp Green Pine.  And there's even more shocking plot twists here than in season 1!  There's more twists here than a kite caught in a hurricane!  Some of it admittedly gets complicated with all the myriad running subplots here; but hey; unspooling this stuff is half the fun!  Still a great show!  Still filled with sizzling, shocking thriller elements; with all sorts of sex and gore and blue material that will make you blush; and also air-tight suspense that will keep you on the edge of your seats!  It's no Facts of Life!  That's for sure!  But it's still awesome!! Highly recommended!",

UPDATE : nothing has changed for the better. the S2 E3 called digestif, actually is very hard to digest. the only positive side is that the cast is full of brilliant actress. but if the script is weak even they can't do anything. UPDATE : no land on the horizon. still an incredibly talentet cast.",

That said, it seems to be moving along slower than S1 but that's probably because as I stated above. Things are mounting up for the adult survivors in similar & different ways. The wilderness is definitely in them. It's clear that in order for the kids to survive, blood must be spilled in order for the wilderness to provide meat to eat. Blood for blood. If I had to guess, I think Coach will be the next to succumb to the elements & starvation. I was disappointed slightly in E3 because things happened but at the same time nothing happened. E3 seems to be a catalyst of new problems that'll arrive in E4.",
