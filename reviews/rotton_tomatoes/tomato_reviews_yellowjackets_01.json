I thought it would get interesting but I honestly skipped through so much boring, disgusting sexual content along with stories about them as adults that seemed like fuller content.

So I watched those episodes again with her and finished out the season at the same time Season Two premiered.  A very fun personal journey through the show thus far!

Great writing, that keeps you coming straight to watch. If you binge the first season, you yearn to see more, having the week by week intrigue, wanting it to drop a new episode.

The characters are amazing, as well as the casting, and the show adresses trauma flawlessly.  The soundtrack mixed with the jarring imagery is beautiful to watch. The plot never drags and always keeps the viewer engaged, and is so incredibly human. Yellowjackets is my favorite show of all time, and is a must-see.",

      "review": "What a crazy conflagration of exploitation pics and girl power action epics!  This is a crazy confection of The Lord of the Flies; Swiss Family Robinson; Lost, I Know What You Did Last Summer; Thirty Something; Little Women; The Facts of Life; The Craft and Harvest Home.  The plot is one of those Now and Then/ Before and After narratives where the story is split in half; between the girl versions of the characters; and their middle aged woman doppelgangers.  The story follows a high school girl's soccer team called the Yellow Jackets.  The trouble starts for the team when they are flying on a plane to a national conference.  During the flight their plane unfortunately crashes in some remote part of the Canadian Rockies. And the girls are abandoned and without means for communication; and have to resort to all sorts of horrifying means for survival; breaking all the Ten Commandments; even dabbling into witch craft and cannibalism to survive.  And unfortunately once the girls have summoned these dark forces; they continue to terrorize them throughout their lives; bringing all sorts of bad luck; murder and mayhem.  So we see the horrific Lord of the Flies island experience; and then we see their lives 25 years later; and how that horrific event continues to have it's devastating ripple effect/ Butterfly effect on the present. As stated before; this is a going for broke exploitation pic; so they throw in every shock trope under the sun; cannibalism; lesbianism; weird pagan ritualistic sacrifices; black mail and murder; summoning the spirits from beyond and the occult; stalking and abusively codependent relationships; ESP; and about a billion other verboten topics I'm forgetting.  It's also like an old fashioned nostalgia pic; a la American Graffiti or Grease; shoe-horning the late 90s into the stream; and as such we get a bevy of delightful Gen X grunge classics like \"Can't Fight the Seether\" or Seal's \"A View to a Kill\".  It's also great that they brought 90s child stars Juliette Lewis, Elijah Wood and Christina Ricci into the mix; it ads the perfect campy pop culture resonance that this piece needs.  Wood and Ricci, who played love interests in the 1997 dramatic classic Ice Storm (also a nostalgia piece); are back playing a couple again; hilariously!  (Ricci herself ironically starred in a similar now and then type nostalgia pic in 1996 called; appropriately enough, Now and Then; where she played the younger half of one of the characters displayed. Now she plays the older half in another nostalgia pic 25 years later; so everything comes full circle!!).  The cast and the storylines are all delicious.  It's got a similar flavor and feel to another big sci-fi fantasy exploitation soap opera show from 2010s True Blood series. Although the subject matter is very different, (vampires vs. a murderous volley ball team); the feeling you get from it; it's vibe; that of a super lurid campy and sci-fi exploitation pic which throws in everything but the kitchen sink in terms of fantasy tropes; and which appeals largely to queer audiences and women; that aura, that feeling; is exactly the same here.  The plot; which is basically in all it's permutations a psychological thriller; following various cat and mouse games that manifest itself between the characters, is extremely complex and ornate; you might even call it baroque!  And most of this is fun and works very well!  My only complaint is that there are SO many subplots here; that sometimes it does get a little confusing.  Still a great show though!  Loads of black humor and creepy and impressive sci Fi moments; and good old fashioned grand guignol type fun! Let the games begin ladies!",

This is the part of the show I had zero interest in. \nAlso, there is absolutely no one in this show to root for, and at some point, we the audience are asked to \"pick sides\", so to speak. I wanted everyone to die. I would have much preferred if the show presented me with some characters I liked, and, through increasingly desperate circumstances, they start to slowly lose their humanity. Instead, we are presented with a bunch of teen dirtbags off the bat. \nToo bad. The critics talk about this show like it is the best thing they have seen in a while.

      "review": "Yellowjackets is a show that defies easy categorization. It's certainly a mystery, but it's also a survival story with a dash of supernatural horror. These elements combine to lend Yellowjackets its engaging and palpably tense atmosphere. Of course this unsettling energy can be found in the premise of the show. A private plane carrying a regional champion girl's high school soccer team to nationals crashes in a remote wilderness near the Canadian border. What results is the story told in two distinct pieces: the first story is what occurs in the aftermath of the plane crash where the second story involves what became of the girls who made it through their shared traumatic experience now that they're in their mid forties. Casting young women in their late teens alongside women in their forties as the same characters is a bold move, but the casting is fantastic. Among such a large cast one might expect to find weaknesses, but everyone really holds their own. There are unsurprising standouts like leads Melanie Lynskey, Christina Ricci, and Tawny Cypress but the teenage actresses were even more impressive especially given their character's larger emotional range juxtaposed with the relative age of these actresses. We've seen Jasmin Savoy Brown dazzle before, but the Sophies Thatcher and N\u00e9lisse, as well as Samantha Hanratty were a pleasant surprise. The premise is so grand that it relies especially on the strength of the acting to pull it off believably, and there's little doubt that these actors are capable. Outside of the noteworthy acting, the writing and general pacing of Yellowjackets is commendable. Its story flow reminds one of the days of Lost, not just for the plane crash similarity but from the narrative decision to jump back and forth through time as well as the mysteries that abound in the aftermath of the crash. The mystery is where Yellowjackets leverages most of its tension. What did these women do all those years ago that has forced them to come together to conceal the ugly truth? They're friends, sure, but we never get the impression that the 40-something versions of these women really like each other. Rather they're a family forged from trauma for better, but mostly worse. Slowly it's revealed that someone is blackmailing the Yellowjackets, presumably for the unspeakable things they had to do to survive. But what were those things? Who suffered and why? These are questions that Yellowjackets gleefully and expertly teases us with from episode to episode. The finale spurs a little cause for concern as the show's need to extend into a second season threatens the carefully constructed and deeply disturbing atmosphere that has been crafted in season one. But assuming the showrunners have a good plan the finale's implications could prove quite engaging. Yellowjackets wears a lot of hats. It asks us to examine trauma, especially shared trauma, but it also asks us about the value of bonding during said trauma and how others react to known trauma. It asks us to question the limits of survival, belief, betrayal and so much more. But it never seems to get bogged down in any one aspect, instead choosing to cleverly fold these elements into an alluring mystery that captivates the viewer and unfolds near perfectly over its excellent ten episode run.",

Nothing interesting seems to be happening.  Plus this show has several irritating hallmarks of bad TV that you have to kind of just ignore to even get started with it.  Firstly, it has the bane of streaming TV, letterboxing.  This is not a movie, it's a TV show that will only ever be seen on 16x9 TVs.  So it's a big cheat to cut off the top and bottom of the picture.  I think they do it to reduce the file size and save a few pennies on the streaming.  But the money they save doesn't justify the uglification of the image for the viewer.  There's certainly no aesthetic value to widening the horizontal at the expense of the vertical in any of these cropped shows.  Secondly, 2 or 3 times per episode there's some annoying and impertinent song that intrudes over the soundtrack for an unnecessary montage.  You have to mute and turn on the subtitles until the extraneous song ends and the episode resumes normal action.  So if you can get past these irritants, it's still possible to have a good show, but where is it? \nAbout the only thing intriguing so far is Juliette Lewis's character, but only because she's just echoing some of her better work in films like Natural Born Killers. I enjoyed LOST but a show like that is only good while it's running, there's no way to end it satisfactorily.  Now we have dozens of shows like that and it looks like this one is another.  We just don't need another show where the mystery gets so deep it can never be resolved. When I see a show like this scoring 100% on Rotten Tomatoes, it makes me think the new golden age of television has ended and we're now entering the new dark ages of television.",

This show only works if you throw logic out the window and embrace the camp. Thats where it shines. \n\nWhile the actresses who play the adult versions of the characters are obviously doing an amazing job their screentime could have been cut in half. Since the show decides to not answer a whole lot of question at the end you really feel those relationship drama moments - and not in a good way. \n\nHaving different opinions about shows is normal but I am honestly concerned about the 100% rating.

      "review": "While it starts out slow (barring the obviously tumultuous and foreboding first episode), Yellowjackets dedicates plenty of time to building up its characters and isn't heavy-handed with gruesome deaths. Instead, it steadily edges further and further into psychological horror, turning what feels at first like a teen drama into a genuinely gripping battle for survival. The parallels between past and present plotlines tie together plot points but leave enough room for guesswork on the audience's part, and while the first season leaves a lot of unanswered questions, every episode had me eager to see more.\n\nYellowjackets is at its strongest in moments of suspense, constantly leaving you uncertain as to who its heroes and villains really are. Christina Ricci puts in a particularly brilliant turn as Misty Quigley, cheerful yet creepy hanger-on to the core cast of girls. The show is excellently diverse, with LGBTQ and PoC characters galore; most of whom are given the screentime to discuss their minority status without being reduced to it.\n\nThe cinematography is generally solid, besides one or two slightly wonky uses of special effects. Horror imagery is used sparingly, but to great effect. Major props go to the sound team for the wonderfully eerie audio effects and great use of licensed music. Throwaway dialogue, visual framing, and background props are all used to foreshadow various events, both overtly and more subtly. It's the kind of show that liberally encourages fan theories, treading carefully with character deaths and shock reveals rather than handing them out en masse a la Game of Thrones.\n\nAll in all, I'm furious at the idea of waiting another year for another season of Yellowjackets. Its young cast (for the 1996 section of the ongoing plot) are believable if not always likable, while their present-day counterparts are well-cast and allow room for some pleasingly dark humour reminiscent of NBC's Good Girls. It's been some time since a show grabbed me as much as this did, and I can't wait for more.",

Up until that moment there still was this credit of trust that the flippancy with which the horrifying events in the past were treated will come to be balanced by the impact in the present. But their collective behaviour in the aftermath of Shauna stabbing the person she had just claimed she was in love with, that \ntrivialised the trauma and turned the characters into people who just go about life killing and dismembering and you start wondering why they haven't been doing just that these last 25 years, really, when it's always been so readily available and required so little provocation.  This is where the show begins to feel like a clever-ish farce, a slight upgrade from the 2004 desperate housewives, with a touch of Ratched.\n\nI also read that Christina Ricci refused to play 'more relatable' and it seems to have affected the others, too,  as toward the end of the show they seem to be competing for the most sociopathic performance of the year. They all turn morose, all speaking in the same dark ironic tone so ill-suited to their age. \n\nMany have compared this to LOST and I'm not a fan because it's hoaky but LOST was also earnest and had lots of heart. This is a world that knows no heart and no colours other than dissociated and mean.",

The final three episodes were the payoff and why I will be a Yellowjacket diehard for the remainder of its run. Brilliant storytelling. Brilliant acting.

The timeline after the crash progresses at a varying pace without any mention of how long they've been stranded (use a journal entry, duh). Some episodes cover a few hours while others appear to be months. As other users have mentioned, parts of the plot are too absurd to overlook and spoil the entire narrative like a long abandoned vehicle working, limitless ammo (written in the script) and miraculous wound healing among many other problems.\n\nThere are some good performances from exactly who you'd expect, Ricci and Lynskey, but the rest of the cast wasn't ready for a production of this magnitude. I'm not sure a killer cast could have saved it though-- the writing is absolutely atrocious.\n\nThe critics are full of it on this one. 100% really REALLY? No wonder no one believes their lies anymore. There are seasons of television classics like The Sopranos, The Wire and The Office that score 85% or lower.\n\ntl;dr\nYellowjackets is at best 33/100 and deserves a watch only after you've been scrolling for 10 mins asking yourself \"what else is there?\"",

This one didn't have that appeal to me, maybe it was to many characters and flashing back and forth from high school to modern day. I think i might of enjoyed it more if they ran the first part of what happened with the yelbow jackets and than went to modern day on how it effected them still , This just feels cluttered to me.  I don't think I would watch a second season.  It has a good cast.  Production values are great. Story cluttered and slow at times . Flash backs are at least half the show so it sorta limited my enjoyment.  It is needed for some back story but I likely would of rather seen season 1 be the back story and season 2 modern day .

Meanwhile I watched it wondering why most of the characters aren't believable in their responses to trauma. They feel one dimensional. Big conversations are forced and have no nuance.  I feel bad for some of the actors that have to act out the poor writing (overreact to mundane things, and then underreact to things that would be a big deal). \n\nThat said, I enjoyed the scenes where either the young or older Misty character interacts with anyone. Coach was cool, and so was Natalie. I enjoyed the \"reporter.\" \n\nBut all-in-all, I was pretty disappointed after reading the hype around a spooky 90s girl soccer team \"Alive\" meets \"Lord of the Flies\". \n\nWith better dialogue and believable human reactions to the deaths, trauma, survival, etc. this show could've been next level.

I'm fact, all the stars turn in food performances. It's the writing and plot that don't go anywhere. Even at the end of the entire series, the audience is left wondering if anything of any real interest happened while they were stranded. So far (and these aren't really spoilers because there is literally nothing to spoil in this entire season) we know they drank mushroom tea and had some innocent high school sex and waved around a knife. Ooohhh! Thrilling!! And then a girl froze to death. Oh, my! What action! What a harrowing development! Contain yourselves while you wait 10 full hours/episodes to find out that literally nothing of interest happened when they were stranded. \nAside from that, there are some passing moments of interest but again,  nothing compelling and nothing that makes you want to see another season. But again! We're a culture in decline, we're a world locked down and desperate for something\u2026anything\u2026and I guess our standards have gotten so low that we don't even care anymore If what we surround ourselves with is good or bad or even mediocre. We just watch series like this because we have nothing better to do and then we go on social media and pretend that we can't believe how amazing this is because all of our friends think it's cool. \nThe theme song and intro are honestly one of the better parts of each episode. \nI'm so uncool for acknowledging how tragically mediocre this series is and I'm fine with that. But Christina Ricci and Juliette made even the mediocrity feel like it was bearable. \nHollywood: please give these incredibly talented women better roles in better projects.

      "review": "Arguably the most talked about new show of 2021, Yellowjackets quickly presented itself as an intriguing genre-mesh with leagues to deliver in both style and ideas! While hardly the first show to feature two timelines in the narrative (one set in the 90's focusing on a group of high schoolers stranded after a plane crash, and the other during the present and centered on the survivors), the show still feels more organic in its storytelling than most, even when it gets more outlandish. Horror elements are scattered throughout the 10 episodes, but it's hard to shrug them off as not being thematically concise, as they gel with the show's themes regarding childhood trauma as well as the tense but tongue-in-cheek tone. Yellowjackets is unapologetically a show that also is to try to toy with nostalgia from a certain age set, with its alt-rock soundtrack communicating on the 90's attitude, something perfectly captured in the show's opening credits with its eerie use of VHS-quality footage and musicians Craig Wedren and Anna Waronker's equally invigorating and harrowing song 'No Return'. The casting also reflects this, with 90's it girls like Juliette Lewis and Christina Ricci, with the latter giving a brilliant inverse of her typecast, playing a character that's affable in her quirkiness but also potentially evil and/or insane! Pulpy, tense, fun, and with consistently high quality in terms of writing and filmmaking,  Yellowjackets might very well be your next tv obsession, and the unexpected finale really opens up doors for next season!",

Mental illness, everyday domestic dissonances, substance use, and sexual situations are all mixed in doses and on levels that never seem over done or abused gratuitously for showtime/HBO viewership pandering.",

Mothers who seemingly have better things to do than pay attention to their creepy child.

Reporters, Donors, Lovers...all want a piece of their truth. \n\nIn some ways the show reminds me of Apple TV's Invasion.

Classics are classics, because they are great stories. And, the cast is packed with accomplished character- \nactors who are well known for their portrayal of psychotic types.  However, this re-take couldn't be more boring. It gets one star because the opening scene was compelling and grabbed my interest. After that, I've been waiting for something\u2014ANYTHING\u2014to happen, but nothing does. The premise of the whole show is that something happened in the woods where the plane crashed which has  had a lasting, negative effect on the women in this story, but it takes way too long to make any connection.  It is clear that each woman has psychological problems now because of \"what happened,\" but they never get to the what. The plot drags on and on, flashing back and forth between the 90s and present day, with each boring scene making the statement: this woman is a psychological mess of depression & anxiety with a dash of psychosis, due to her time in the woods with the other girls. The story also eludes to some sort of other-worldly/occult influence over the group,, which basically had me SMH and thinking, \"what?\" On top of a plot that goes nowhere, the characters (both young and old) are entirely unlikable. They are collectively annoying, depressing and immoral. And, somehow, each character's brand of immorality is thoroughly boring. It is difficult to make any connection to the girls in the forest or their adult counterparts. The characterization is lacking in that way too little attention has been payed to bringing the audience into the girls' experience.  So far, this show has been a big disappointment. I simply cannot understand what some people like about it.",

The writer looked at top girls sports 2021 pop got soccer. This show flip flops all over time the pilot should be a start to what is happening but it is so all over place you cant even get into show. Lets talk now about the critcs on rotten tomatoes they must have been paid being no way it could get a perfect score read watcher reviews and you will see that this show it total garbage. I give it 5 \ud83d\udc4eand zero  \ud83c\udf45 .....",

Lord of the Flies for girls with pedestrian imaginings of who they become years later.   Just because we have run out of good stuff to watch due to covid shutdowns doesn't mean we should invest our time with this convoluted drivel or try to care about what happens to these fictional survivors.",

      "review": "Part \"Lost\", part \"Lord of the Flies\" (distaff division), \"Yellowjackets\" follows a girls' high school soccer team that crash-lands in a densely-wooded area on their way to a far-off tournament.  The action shifts back and forth in time (again, just as in \"Lost\"), with the grown-up versions of the girls in the present, and their younger, less mature, frightened selves living (and trying their damnedest to survive) in the past.  Much has been made already (I've seen three episodes so far) of the deep, dark secrets the survivors are concealing; what, exactly, DID happen in those woods? WAS cannibalism involved? (It's certainly been teased.) And how were they able to make it out of there alive, anyway? Good questions all, and whatever promise the series has--and it's got a lot--undoubtedly lies in the Big Reveals that are right around the corner; anticipating those moments should keep fans glued to their TVs for weeks to come.  If there's a problem with \"Yellowjackets\", though, it's the size of the cast; the girls themselves, the troubled, unsmiling, secretive women they become, all the peripheral characters--there's a lot.  But the acting is fine, the relationships believable, and the crash sequence itself--which has been repeated more than once--may steer you away from air travel for good.  Well...there's always Amtrak.",

The second to the last episode was especially lame however. I'm sorry but shrooms do not make you a psychotic murderer. It may give you great hallucinations and the giggles but not homicidal impulses... And if you were to sleep outside and it starts to snow, you would wake up from being too cold, not freeze to death. There are many more issues with the plot but these were some of the glaring ones.",

If not and if you want something far more sinister and thought provoking with great cinematography -- go to Amazon and watch \"Fortitude,\" an awesome 3 season series.",

It's nearly entirely female driven, great cast, and relies on past/present narratives woven together. The pilot ends with a real bang. I do wish Showtime had released 2 or even 4 episodes up front, to help the audience get hooked. The show teases where it is going in the future, and it is going to get very, very dark. It's almost like Lord of the Flies,  but all female, in the dead of winter in the Canadian Rockies. The present narrative also sets the stage for a lot of intrigue. Some are comparing it to Lost, but I think this series will remain more grounded in reality, and because it isn't network, it is not constrained the way Lost was in terms of adult content.",
