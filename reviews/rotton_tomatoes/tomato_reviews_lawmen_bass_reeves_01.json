But the performances are top-notch, the violence is visceral and brutal, and the whole thing is well shot.\n\nI only complaint is that I wish the show had focused more on Bass Reeves real life, exploits and less on the historical fiction  novels upon which the show is based.  There's enough in that man's life that they could've run a show for five seasons, and the need to tie up everything in a single arc caused them to leave out a lot of interesting material (example: The real account of what happened to the cook, would've been more interesting than what we got.) \n\nStill, solid effort.",

Where do good-hearted and honorable outcasts go in this wild and fractured American west?\nLike the earlier mentioned samurai, Bass Reeves' character lives by an immutable code, informed by judeo-Christian ethics , felt hatred he personally experienced, and the desire to be a citizen, husband, father, and lawman of honor.",

In walking across a sage brush covered desert, anybody with any sense would wrap their feet in cloth or something rather than go barefoot.  We were hoping for something a bit more realistic.  I guess the director wanted drama more than credibility.",
