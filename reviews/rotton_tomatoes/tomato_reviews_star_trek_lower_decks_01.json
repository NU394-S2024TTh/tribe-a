They understand what Star Trek is all about and yet are able to take it in a new refreshing direction, similar to  what The Mandalorian achieved over in the Star Wars universe.\n\nI don't understand why the audience score on this site is on the low side.

There's no tension because there's not meant to be. There's no reflecting on mistakes or growing as a character because that wouldn't be funny...\nLong gone are the days of going where no one has gone before, focusing on mad-cap, crazy reactions to whatever they come across, insulting both themselves and their discoveries at a ludicrously fast pace.\nIf you like comedy ala Rick and Morty, you're going to find this inferior to that series but still generally entertaining.

I know this show gets A LOT of FLACK from people like me, and a lot of the YouTube channels I subscribe to hate it and report on how much the viewers don't care for the show. Honestly, I don't associate the show with old Trek (or any of Trek series). I simply look at it as an animated show which features ST (and name drops lol) and I watch it and laugh. I don't think it does a disservice to ST. DS9, TNG, TOS -all stellar. I even watched the Animated series -back IN the 70s when it aired (granted they were re-runs, but still)! I say let the show have some fun with Trek. Oh, and in case anyone is wondering: I think STD and Picard are garbage... either of those two shows should be flushed. STLD is just silly, and I like it.

      "review": "I've always thought animation was a great medium for sci-fi shows and Lower Decks takes full advantage of a lot of the things you can do with animated sci-fi, allowing for more alien-looking aliens, detailed sci-fi landscapes and a lot of scenarios you can't easily do with traditional live-action without having to invest in a ton of CGI.\n\nI would say the biggest thing that will probably throw people when it comes to this show is the expectation that it's more \"adult\" than it is.  It's probably about on par with Voyager/ENT in terms of general adult content like nudity/references to sex, though it does have a lot more swearing than either of those shows.  I do like that despite being a so-called \"Comedy\" show, it actually does seem to focus a lot on character development, especially with Mariner.  Even better, they have some great action.  The episode \"Crisis Point\", in particular, has some really gorgeous shots.  They do save the best for last though and the finale utilizes the animated format to its best advantage for an action-packed space battle that would have been very costly to do in a live-action show with the same budget.\n\nI do have a couple of complaints but they're fairly minor.  The first one is that certain things happen too fast in the show, episodes can feel a bit packed or rushed at times, which is understandable given the shorter format.  I really wish the season finale had been a two-parter.  The second issue I have is probably unique to me. I love the call-backs to everything in the show, but sometimes I feel the verbal callbacks are a bit more noticeable/overt to the point of being a little distracting.  The visual callbacks tend to be more subtle and I like them a lot more.\n\nOverall, really enjoying this show and looking forward to Season 2!",

When Lower Decks puts its focus on more Trek-like adventures, and makes jokes based on familiar Trek-like situations instead of superficial references and callbacks, it really shines. It has some very likeable, vibrant, well-acted over-the-top characters, but suffers from glazed-over character development that intentionally resets at the end of every episode, with the same couples and challenges re-run several times. The last episode is definitely the pinnacle of the show, which has a real threat, real stakes, great callbacks (The Titan!) and character development. It has all the Lower Decks silliness going on but doesn't let it hinder the great drama and characterisation throughout the episode. \n\nThere is some real heart and definitely some real Star Trek here, and I'm happy it's being renewed for another season. I hope the creators refocus their efforts more on ridiculous space adventures and allow the characters to develop in a more serious, fruitful way. Keep the silliness, but create some real drama each episode. If they do that, they could really achieve a colourful comedy Star Trek for everyone.",

Lower Decks lacks all of the wannabe clever writing that is in Discovery or Picard, which is a good thing, it is one of the main pros of this show.

I may find something's funny and just sit there without laughing or showing any emotion to convey that I found it funny, but this show actually had me laughing out loud in certain moments or had me geeking out over little easter eggs and references to past iterations of Star Trek. The show even made me feel empathy at the end of the season when they killed off Shax.  My only gripe with this show that keeps me from giving it the full 5 stars is its pacing seems a bit rushed due to its short run time, The dialog sometimes feels rushed and so does some plot lines which sets back the show in certain aspects.

If any of the production staff reads this, my advice is:\n\nA) Give the characters more depth. \n\nSome of the character-defining \"ticks\" can be replaced by moments that show more of their humanity. Beckett Mariner comes across as a spoiled, two-dimensional jerk too much of the time. It was nice when she tried to help Brad in Ep. 2, but it comes a bit late and little.\n\nB) Humor / heart balance\n\nI think the series also has to commit to how emotionally \"realistic\" certain moments are meant to be: such as when Rutherford and his \"date\" are quipping during a zombie attack.\n\nBoth issues, interestingly, are creating a similar imbalance: too much \"funny\" with not enough reason for us to care. If a zombie attack has no weight, why care about the characters' journeys at all?\n\nHighly recommend the Orville to see how humor doesn't have to be sacrificed for heart! Hope to see a Season 2!",

This one cut from the same cloth. \nLower Decks follow a quarte of young Officers of USS Cerritos, California Class vessel that seen better days, as they must various realities of military life, from grunt work to the b.s. of the Senior Command Staff, and weekly danger that every Trek series uses for drama, now used for comic effect.\nThe cast is pretty solid, form clean-cut, studious. upward driven but woefully lacking any real-world experience, Ensign Brad Boimler. To Ensign Beckett Mariner, a Starfleet burnout who knows more about Starfleet then she lets on, but drive to do the right thing put at odds with protocol and the Senior Staff, derailing her career. She has made it her personal mission to protect the her fellow Lower Decks, and fun while she at it. To Ensign D'Vana Tendi, (a green skin busty Orion girl, as to Star Trek tradition) a young medical official wide eyes, cheerful, innocent,  is unfazed craziness of any situation. And Ensign Sam Rutherford, a newly cyborg implant enhanced Engineer, who Vulcan implant conflicts his natural human emotion, creating awkward situations if his pure nerdiness doesn't do it first.\nThe Senior staff of Cerritos is every Star Trek command crew, dialed to 11.\nFrom the \"Bro\" Commander, who to love throw his weight around(even if he only 2nd in command), The Bones like Senior Medical (who happen to be a Caitian, a species last seen in first time Trek was animated), and the Captain, whos relationship Ensign Mariner, make you wonder if she is put her feels separate from her professional duty.\nDon't buy the hate and give this show a chance.",

Professionalism is the hallmark of an Astronaut. I like the movie Apollo 13, but compare the film to the actual tapes of the accident happening. Calm. Cool. Collected. The entire time. A crew of three men, far from our planet, quite potentially minutes from death, and they kept their focus, did their jobs, and saved their own lives. \n\nDramatic moments happened in all the original Treks... but outbreaks of powerful emotions, like Picard in First Contact, stand out for good reason. Just like when Picard is letting his emotions come to the fore while maintaining his professionalism, like in Drumhead, or Measure of a Man. Kirk has been reinvented as a fly boy, a hothead, compared to the collected officer and a gentleman he was. A man who clearly belonged in command, and bore it's weight well. Now at the end of that downward slope... we arrive at a thinly painted Rick and Morty rip off. \n\nWhy in the nine circles of hell is the parody of Star Trek, The Orville... better?",

If you're making a new TV series, wouldn't you get a focus group to make sure that your first episode is a good example of what the series intends to be, since the first episode is crucial in hooking the audience?  It's like they tried to go for some Rick and Morty vibe, but completely failed to realize why Rick and Morty is funny.  Even if there are better episodes later, then they really screwed up in conveying that.  And since it's CBS All Access, aka \"old media who still don't get it\", you gotta wait a week to see the next one.  Most people probably cancelled the subscription, if they didn't already after Discovery and Picard.\n\nThe only possible redeeming quality about this show is the setting, which is nostalgic Star Trek: TNG era, from the ship design to the sound effects.

This cartoon Trek could have done the non-command crew well while being lighthearted and comical. But ultimately they became the command crew by default, so then what's the point. What they showed is they can't actually write Lower-decks about the lower decks. It is still command-Star Trek only without the bridge crew as stars, but the plot still revolved around the bridge crew.\n\nUltimately a comedy needs jokes that land. They didn't except for a bit of fan service for Trek diehards.  But I don't think there was a craving for American Pie in space.",

      "review": "When this show was first announced I was excited: a series from the perspective of \"the little people.\" Given how much I enjoyed previous episodes that followed that POV such as the TNG episode this series takes its name from, and other such episodes like Babylon 5's \"A View from the Gallery,\" I thought it would be a nice departure from the usual focus on the top tier officers. Then I found out it was going to be animated. .... I mean, ok? Then Picard debuted. ...wow. Then the trailer premiered, and I found myself not loving the style or the writing as I didn't laugh once.  Then CBS put out the first few minutes of the pilot and the establishing shot of the Starbase made it clear they were going for the TNG/DS9/VOY aesthetic and once again I was somewhat optimistic... until Mariner showed up and started rambling like a meth addict, which is odd as she was supposed to be drunk on Romulan \"whiskey.\" Oh boy. Not one laugh. \nWell, I just finished watching the first episode, which I acquired through means other than via CBS All Access as I cancelled that after the third episode of Picard, and I find myself kind numb really. I WANT to like this show. I love that someone finally figured out that the design of Disco and Picard are NOT what fans wanted, and that this series clearly takes place in the world of Star Trek we know and love. But it just wasn't FUNNY, which is the most damning thing anyone can say about a series that is supposed to be a comedy. To be blunt, Mariner just sucks. I get where they were going with her but they didn't make it work. She's arrogant, overbearing and while supposedly better than everyone and capable of much greater things she chooses to take the path of least resistance for \"reasons.\" She's the stereotypical slacker fantasy of \"yeah I could totally have a better life than I do right now, but like I refuse to sell out and live up to other's expectations cuz they're all hypocrites, man. Totally.\" Whatever. Meanwhile everyone that actually has to suffer and toil for every inch they get, never approaching a tenth of what she could achieve if she actually tried, secretly hate her guts. She's supposed to be the cool counter-culture spokesperson, but what her writers are too dense to grasp is that she is like that millionaire, lighting his cigar with a crisp hundred dollar bill while his limo rolls by the rest of us, simply because he CAN. Oh yeah, awesome character to hang your entire series on, CBS. \nBoimler, in contrast, also sucks but for reasons that rest on the opposite end of the spectrum. Dude is gutless to the point he can't actually do the right thing and follow orders, nor can he stand up to his commanding officer when she gives him unethical orders either. He's a spineless coward who supposedly \"sees the light\" at the end of the episode when really he just manages to be manipulated by Mariner's BS, not because she cares about him but because she's BORED and he's the flavor of the week. \nAt the end of the episode we have a comedy that didn't inspire a single laugh, and characters that aren't interesting enough to remember their names other than the two I mentioned above because they are constantly mentioned by name and rote memorization works. Basically Lower Decks wants to be Rick and Morty meets The Orville, and it's not. That little tidbit there is the final ironic point I'll draw attention to in this review: Seth McFarlane was turned down by CBS when he approached them years ago with the idea of a spoof set in the Star Trek universe because execs back then were concerned it would cheapen the brand. Fast forward to today and we have season 3 of The Orville premiering this fall, a show that has widely been accepted as the true successor to Trek by Trek fans, and CBS puts out Lower Decks, a series that actually manages to do that which those execs were worried about McFarlane doing when they turned him down. There is a day of reckoning coming to the executive offices of CBS soon, and they only have themselves to blame. Maybe next time they'll try something that most successful businesses have made their fortunes on: actually listening to the target consumer base and put out a product they want instead of trying to force feed them something they think they should want.",

Not something fans of either Star Trek or comedy would enjoy.",

The first episode has the senior command staff throwing up on each other as they contact a zombie rage virus. It has all the outrageousness of Rick and  Morty but in a classic setting that is so wrong. I didn't find it funny. Not a titter. I didn't like the characters. I was grossed out by all the plotlines. I am a forgiving man and I will watch it again to see if there is any chance of character growth. But I sincerely doubt it.

For me \u2018Lower Decks' after the great disappointment of \u2018Discovery' and shear horror of \u2018Picard' marks a return to a show that looks and feels like \"Star Trek\". It is a parody of course, but one clearly made by people who love and know Star Trek, a key feature of much of the humor. The animation is beautiful with the TNG design aesthetic, the simplicity of the art being deceptive because there is a lot of background detail that made repeat viewing engaging. The music is a great homage to TOS, TNG, and the films.\n\nIt's a fast pace show with rapid banter and zany plot developments \u2013 but it works because it is a half-hour cartoon comedy like \u2018Futurama' or the \u2018Simpsons'. If this was live action it be bad, but as a cartoon its cute. There is \"adult humor\", but so far, none of the eyeballs being ripped out of sockets and F-bombs of \u2018Picard'. I think there is a lot of room for growth, with hopefully more serious and weighty plots \u2013 but so far \u2018Lower Decks' for me is off to a good start. Unlike the dread that I felt before every new \u2018Discovery' episode and the far, far, far worse \u2018Picard' \u2013 I'm looking forward to the next episode of \u2018Lower Decks'.\n\nThere will be some Star Trek fans who will hate \u2018Lower Decks' like there are some fans who somehow love \u2018Discovery' (ugh) and \u2018Picard' (OMG!). But for fans who while taking Trek seriously could always find humor in the campiness and ludicrousness of some of the situations and plots of TOS, TNG, DS9, and VOY, I think it has an audience. I would love to see Trek again achieve the greatness in art and entertainment of \u2018The Wrath of Khan', Search for Spock', and \u2018The Voyage Home' \u2013 but for me \u2018Lower Decks' is a return back to what I always enjoyed about Star Trek, the humor, camaraderie, adventure, and sense of wonder \u2013 in a zany cartoon form.",
