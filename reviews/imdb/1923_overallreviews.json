{"title":"Looking forward to more","review":"I absolutely love 1923! It's right up there with Yellowstone and 1883. If you're a fan of those two then you'll be a fan of this to. It takes the best of both of those shows and combine it for this one. This is definitely a show for adults with all the violence and language it that's what makes it so good. It's not for children. At this point Taylor Sheridan can do no wrong. He hits home run after home run. I love everything about this show...the acting, writing, directing, production, cinematography, etc, etc. Are all excellent. I mean this stars Harrison Ford and Helen Mirren for crying out loud. For those two A-list actors to do a tv show you know it had to be good. I know those two are going to get all the attention, and rightfully so, but there are just so many other great actors in this. Too many to even name. I can't wait to see more of this series and where it goes.","rating":"9\/10","date":"10 December 2023"}
{"title":"Love It","review":"1923 is the next prequel to Yellowstone after 1883 and like those two shows this is just as incredible! As a huge fan of those two shows I was really looking forward to this and it did not disappoint! It continues to follow the Dutton family and show how they created the Yellowstone ranch. This obviously takes place in 1923 during prohibition and the Great Depression. It's another gritty western from Taylor Sheridan. Sheridan is one of the best things going on television right now, everything he touches turns to gold. Just look at his resume (Yellowstone, 1883, Mayor of Kingstown, Tulsa King, Sicario, Hell or High Water, etc.). Harrison Ford and Helen Mirren lead an amazing cast who are all at their best here. I'll be shocked if this show doesn't win numerous awards.","rating":"9\/10","date":"12 December 2023"}
{"title":"Today 100 Years Ago","review":"The mark of great storytelling is the ability to address current issues in an entertaining manner. There may be viewers who are watching this series for the mind-numbing effects it most certainly can provide, being essentially a Western found near the end of the Wild West era of the good ol' U. S. of A. But my money is on the possibility that a large majority of viewers are enjoying this story because it deals with issues that humanity at large has yet to fully deal with or appreciate, depending on the value placed upon the ideal--greed, hatred, power, the thrill of torture, ethnic prejudice, true romance, living life on the edge, sadism, survival, hope, belief (faith), and love. Despite what the American system was developed to accomplish--namely to create a state of living good for Caucasians of British descent and uncomfortable for any people falling outside of that narrow scope--there have always been good, moral people living in the States (and territories) who have cared for others as well as themselves, and who carry no prejudices against any others. The Duttons are just such a family--a clan anyone would be proud to belong to. There are extremely shocking scenes throughout the series--rape, torture, brutality, sadism, murder, postmortem mutilation, and of course gunfights. Here's hoping the writers\/actors strike ends soon so the writers and directors can continue with this brilliant saga as good as or just a touch better than the 1883 series which tells of the earlier Dutton clan.","rating":"9\/10","date":"27 October 2023"}
{"title":"Except","review":"I'm very sure the general public is ignorant about the Indian Boarding Schools that were rampant throughout the West during that time period and were run by churches and our government. The Heard Museum in Phoenix has an excellent display of the horrors that we subjected Native Americans to in order to assimilation them. Taylor Sheridan is just referencing real history. If you think it's horrible, good. It was. That's how white people treated Native Americans then. As to the character of the young girl, Teonna, I believe she will be the ancestor of Chief Rainwater in Yellowstone.As to the young man playing Spencer Dutton, he's in Africa because he was too traumatized by WWI to go home. If you don't know the history, you won't understand.We are only 2 episodes into 1923. Sheridan has said it will take 2 seasons to complete this story. Be patient. There's a long way to go.","rating":"10\/10","date":"29 December 2022"}
{"title":"Range War's Already Started","review":"First, let's talk about Taylor Sheridan. I don't like 'Yellowstone' and stopped watching it when I realized it was a soap opera and not a drama and all of its characters are unlikeable. In the case of the daughter-despicable. I thought 1883 got off to a brilliant start, but lost its way after the halfway point. I thought Sheridan's screenplay for 'Hell or High Water' was fantastic. His screenplay and direction of 'Wind River' was outstanding. I love 'The Mayor of Kingstown' and I'm really liking 'Tulsa King.' So, it's a mixed bag.1923 starts out like a drama and let's hope it stays that way. Harrison Ford and Helen Mirren are perfectly cast. Isabel May, from 1883, is back for the narration, which will upset some who couldn't stand her accent, but I thought her poetic narration was perfect.So, 1923 is off to a promising start and I look forward to the next episode.","rating":"8\/10","date":"19 December 2022"}
{"title":"Taylor Sheridan delivers another solid show","review":"Big fan of Yellowstone and 1883 so was expecting great things from 1923; so far so good!1883 had the western vibe, with a romantic, dreamy narrative, which I loved.Yellowstone is outstanding for a plethora of reasons (Kelly Reilly is queen!), but mainly I enjoyed how they've woven current time city problems & the old, generational country cowboy lifestyle.1923 has an entirely different feel to it to both of the above and still somehow manages to keep Yellowstone fans excited. I love how we've ventured from the ranch\/Montana into new surroundings (Africa) with the wonderful Brandon Sklenar to give us a bit of a respite from the fields and mountains (although breathtaking) and to keep things interesting.So far, very excited for the rest of the season and can't wait to see what Taylor Sheridan comes up with next for the Dutton family!","rating":"9\/10","date":"5 January 2023"}
{"title":"Hits and misses","review":"I REALLY like some bits of this series and find other bits oddly off...as if they don't fit the rest of the story genre-wise. The most off bits are the scenes with Spencer and his love interest Alex. Unfortunately the casting of her really ruined those scenes for me. She is supposed to be British from London but speaks standard American and her too peroxide hair and a forever giggling, flirtatious 'vaudeville' acting (even in highly distressful scenes) means you can't take her seriously. She doesn't feel real, and so all those scenes just feel like a much less dramatic genre than the rest of the series where especially the scenes at the Indian nunnery school stand out in intensity. Helen Mirren and Harrison Ford's characters are also impeccable, nuanced and full of gravitas. All in all a great series but with a bit of genre confusion.","rating":"7\/10","date":"13 February 2023"}
{"title":"I want to love this","review":"As a Scotsman there is nothing more excruciating and gnawing as listening to a failed attempt at a Scottish accent. Who cast Jerome Flynn as a Scotsman, Mel Gibson? Are there no Scottish actors or is it impossible to do a Scottish accent. I love everything about this whole universe but the Scottish accent makes me angry as if anyone thinks that sounds authentic then they've never met anyone from Scotland. I've still given this a ten as I love it still and with it being the wild west I'm sincerely hoping that someone will shoot him in the throat and relieve my ears of the butchering of my on tongue. Sort this out as it is insulting to all the Scots that helped build America.","rating":"10\/10","date":"30 December 2022"}
{"title":"Too dark, slow, and depressing with not enough payoff","review":"I'm seven episodes in at this point. Tried to give the series time to find its footing so that I could give a fair review. My overall opinion: Too much darkness, not enough light.I keep watching mostly because of the big names involved and because I know the writer is a quality writer given what he did with 'Yellowstone.' But I find I don't get excited about new episodes; it feels like a chore to be completed versus a story you're excited to explore more.The Indian vs Catholic storyline is relentlessly depressing. The violence and suffering and gore and sadness is too much to bear. I've resorted to fast-forwarding through a lot of the beatings and violent encounters; they all seem to end the same way. It's gratuitous, not needed to further the plot line at all. After seeing someone beat almost to death five times, you kind-of get the point.The Dutton farm storyline is okay; the big actors make it interesting enough for I suppose, but it's somewhat underwhelming as a main storyline. You know it's setting up something but it takes glacial pace to get there.Then there's the third leg of the story: Hunter Spencer and the annoying trollop he collected and made a wife. I can't stress how much I despise the latter character. First, she looks too young to be paired with the actor; second, the endless little sarcastic quips they've made her entire dialogue is beyond grating.The only reasons to still tune in are 1) waiting to see the \"hero\" Spencer Dutton save his family and 2) waiting to see the Catholic terrorists get their comeuppance. The problem is the show is soooo sloooow in getting to either one.I'm not sure if this is a show I'll desire to return to next season (if there is one). I just don't know if there's enough of a payoff to endure the overly-slow, overly-violent storylines.","rating":"6\/10","date":"26 February 2023"}
{"title":"Great start then nothing happened for 6 episodes","review":"I can't believe how stagnant the story was. I gave 1 star each for the first 3 episodes then it literally ground to a halt for 5 boring episodes. Literally nothing moved, the just played out little side plots... My god why would they spend so long on Spenser's transit as if watching him drift aimlessly on the ocean is somehow interesting or entertainment... News flash... It ain't! And back at the ranch the same thing happened... Winter came but not only seasonally but plot and storyline as well. Drawn out debauchery, people just sitting and lying around passing the time... God a sitcom has more activity, plot and interesting characters.I'm not sure whether COVID restricted their advancing the plot but it's the most pedestrian and disappointing writing I've watched for a long time. Sorry for the rant but thought it was terrible for the above mentioned reasons.","rating":"3\/10","date":"27 February 2023"}

What attracts me to this show is when this young alike Indiana Jones character called Spencer Dutton plays by a good looking Brandon Sklenar gets all actions , thrilling scenes with lions\/ leaopard in Africa. I wish Brandon gets a standalone series or something just him & the lions & his adventures. Harrison Ford the lead , amazing as always , then I also saw James Badge Dale but his name not in opening theme not sure why. So far the storyline are well paced, I am looking forward to see more of the story of this Duttons family.","rating":"10\/10","date":"27 December 2022"}
{"title":"Some of you will love this. And some won't","review":"Most reviews are about content. Sometimes, the exception to the role, you have to peek behind the camera. This is one of those times. Taylor Sheridan has quietly evolved into Hollywood's #1 \"golden boy.\" Sheridan has active been in the industry for less than a decade, and has already demonstrated the ability to write, direct, produce and even act (Sons of Anarchy). He has earned 24 awards out of 57 total nominations. Most importantly, he is the creator behind the massively popular Yellowstone franchise and its knockoffs -- of which 1923 is merely the latest. Knowing that this show was destined to be a hit, the producers doubled down on their reputation for idiosyncratic casting, putting both Harrison Ford and Helen Mirren in the leads. The chemistry not only works, it is brilliant. That said, there are tricks and tropes in 1923 which hint that Sheridan is still experimenting with his scripts (the safari scenes, the exaggerated violence) -- and refuses to fit into any reviewer's preconceived notions or expectations. Good for him. Some viewers will eat that up. And some won't.

And then it ends - obviously this is set up for a second season - BUT - if this doesn't happen then you have just wasted your time as the story isn't even at a conclusion by the end of this first season.And there is currently no announcement or schedule for a second season ....\nThis makes me so mad!It's like going to a great restaurant and only being served the side sissies with no main course!!!

{"title":"Brilliant!","review":"With a cast headlined by heavyweights Harrison Ford and Helen Mirren, the second \"Yellowstone\" prequel was certainly highly anticipated and hyped and - as is often not the case - what we see over eight episodes of the first season live up to the hype.Taylor Sheridan is a genius. Everything is good in 1923 - costumes, scenery, writing, acting - as the Dutton family face The Great Depression in Montana (where it arrived much earlier than probably anywhere else in the world) and are involved in a land dispute. You know what you're going to get as far as acting goes from Harrison Ford and Helen Mirren, whose resumes and accolades more than speak for themselves, but the rest of the cast is also brilliant. I liked Spencer Dutton who is haunted by what he did on the Western Front in World War One. The character perfectly represents the oft-forgotten side of war, and is one of the best in the Yellowstone universe. The side plot about Teonna Rainwater, who is persecuted at a Catholic-run boarding school for native Americans is brilliantly put together but, like so much else in 1923, is quite disturbing and violent.Even if the original Yellowstone bites the dust (as has been heavily rumoured in recent months), I hope Taylor Sheridan keeps on making these spinoffs.","rating":"9\/10","date":"1 April 2023"}

He commands every scene he is in!!He and Helen Mirren, back together again, are a fantastic addition to the streaming and tv platform worlds!The story telling is vivid and detailed.This level of talent is what we need - from the acting to the timeline of how this tale fits with the rest of the Yellowstone catalog.So excited to continue watching the story of the Dutton ranch and family!","rating":"10\/10","date":"18 December 2022"}
{"title":"Beautifully shot, promising first episode","review":"Okay first off before I say anything what's with all the politics? Seriously rating a show because it portrays Catholics spanking their children or such-and-such actor is too Republican or too Democrat?It's sad that people can no longer enjoy a good TV show and need to voice their politics on a review thread.With that said - the camera work on this show is just amazing. First episodes sets up potential plot points nicely, even has a few twists. Helen Mirren is a queen and it looks like she will shine in this role.No prior knowledge of Yellowstone or 1883 is needed to enjoy the pilot, although there is a bit of an Easter egg in terms of showing what happened to Margaret Dutton from 1883.Overall a promising first episode and I will definitely be back for the second episode. Sit back, open your mind, and enjoy a nice work of fiction and you'll be surprised how much better your evening will be.","rating":"10\/10","date":"19 December 2022"}
{"title":"Least favored of the Yellowstone franchises","review":"1923 continues the Yellowstone series as a prequel to Yellowstone and a sequel to 1883. 1923 follows the Dutton family; continuing to tell how the Dutton's have fought over their land throughout the decades.Harrison Ford is cast as Jacob Dutton. Brother to James (Tim McGraw) from 1883. Helen Mirren plays Clara; Jacobs wife. The Duttons once again find their land trying to be stolen out from under them. Then comes the side story of Spencer (James and Margaret Dutton's son) who is being summoned home from his African hunting excursion by his Aunt Clara to help fight for Yellowstone.I was excited for 1923 based on this cast alone. However, it's just not drawing me in. Harrison Fords acting is dry. The gravelly voice; Complete lack of emotion like he's reading a script. Helen Mirren has a horrible Irish accent that isn't really needed at all. There is no \"Connection\" between these two. It's like watching paint dry.The story of Spencer is like a whole different series that makes zero sense. Not only does it seem disconnected, but his love interest \"Alex\" is the most unlikeable person. Stupid jokes. Misplaced sarcasm. I cannot stand her. I wish a lion would eat her, or she'd drown.I'll finish watching the series because I am curious how it will tie into Yellowstone and John Dutton, but after the beautifully written 1883, this is a let down.","rating":"6\/10","date":"20 February 2023"}

The pacing of the episodes leaves you wanting more but equally able to enjoy the moment, several times I had to pause to say \"no\" or \"no way\"!Sheridan has a way of getting you so invested into characters quickly but can be Brutal with them as well.I can only hope this leads to more seasons or prequels!The narration from Isabel May is a nice nod to 1883 and Ford & Mirren are perfect for the roles.","rating":"10\/10","date":"9 January 2023"}
{"title":"Started Well but.......","review":"I enjoyed the first 2 episodes, despite the obvious Wilbur Smith plagiarism for the African element. But I'm afraid that the terrible acting and even worse British upper class fake accent of the newly introduced Alexandra character is just too much to bear, but at least I now can take a comfort break during her scenes without having to pause the programme. It is a bit cliched in parts and doesn't compare favourably with 1883, or Tulsa King or Mayor of Kingstown. I'm not sure I'm going to stay with it but I'll give it another episode before deciding. At he moment it just smacks of a big budget but lazy writing to cash in on the continuing success of the Yellowstone soap opera.","rating":"6\/10","date":"9 February 2023"}
{"title":"Started off strong and went downhill fast","review":"I was excited after watching the first episode of this show, but sadly was more and more dissapointed in it as the episodes went on, to finally ending up disgusted by the last 2 episodes of season 1.The scenes between the couples are gag inducing. They are long and boring. Unnecessary female topless nudity in multiple scenes.The final two episodes contain graphic nudity and BDSM behavior. It's repulsive to include content like that mixed in with the respectful scenes between Helen Mirren and Harrison Ford. The sentiment they were trying to convey about a character's personality could have easily been done without the snuff pornography.The scenes with the American Indians are hard to watch. Sad.I once looked forward to new things from Sheridan; now I dread what filth they will contain as the episodes crawl by at a snails pace.","rating":"1\/10","date":"9 March 2023"}

The storyline and the writing are spectacular. Yellowstone is good but to me it has gotten a little far fetched for my taste but this show so far is flawless. You will fall in love with all the characters. It also has that old western feel to it that makes westerns so much fun. Almost has like a Tombstone feel to it or something.

{"title":"Great but full of let downs","review":"Packed with brilliant performances (Helen Mirren, Harrison Ford, Aminah Nieves) and scenes but ruined by Julia Schlaepfer's overacting and the cheesy dialogue during the romantic scenes. 'Alexandra's' British accent is embarrassingly dire. She repeatedly slips into a bizarre, deep, Germanic drawl and the unbearable drama school acting made us wince. Alongside the other, more serious storylines, and understated performances, her character is laughable, almost a caricature, dampening the impact of the series. For this reason the last few episodes became unbearable to watch. Beautifully shot and overall enjoyable but painful at times with Julia on screen (sadly)","rating":"8\/10","date":"28 March 2023"}

{"title":"The Sheriff from SOA, to creating the greatest modern western over 3 series.","review":"And the first time Harrison Ford has tried in along long time. And his first TV series. Just like Taylor Sheridan has gotten Stallone to act in his first series in 'Tulsa king' which so far is a perfectly paced crime drama that isn't too heavy and still keeps the cowboy feeling to it.. there's never been a crime Mafia series set in cattle\/cowboy country like it and it has Stallone like Ford, putting his all for his age, into the performance. Even tho many shots are obviously not Stallone with the character he's talking to, but using doubles. 5his has become significantly more obvious since the pandemic... actors wanting less interaction with lots of people makes it easier when his driver is talking to him and you can only see a half back of the head of Stallone. This happens in many conversational part of the series with him. But he chews the scenery everytime he's alone and has admitted in interviews doing a tv series is the most demanding and tiring he's ever felt working. Which from the guy that played Rambo.... that says alot about what Mr Sheridan expects from his lead cast. I highly doubt he'd hire Harrison Ford if he was going to play bored old man like he has for 3 decades of film. I feel like he's going to leave this series as his acting legacy. And with James Marigold directing the new Indiana Jones, the same guy that made Logan and got the best performance from the two older leading cast members. I mean since then, is sad so see Patrick Stewart in the newtrek destroyed by A.kurztman...nwith his acting being horrible compared to Logan.Explains how just after one episode I trust it will be a 8-9 out of 10 series. Just the amazing effort by one of the top 3 female actors in the world alive. Helen miren. And then seeing Harrison Ford not only acting for once, but so far doing it really well, Compared to the lead Dutton in 1889 he's killing it with his performance. And this is only after a single episode... but they both play the same character and that's a very hardened man, from loss and hardship.The incredible achievement by Mr Sheridan with yellow stone, then 1889... followed by Tulsa king and 1923 with such a incredible cast. Even if you somehow found this first episode too slow placed, I'd say give it 4 episodes before you make your mind up. I put off watching yellow stone until it's 3rd season... after trying to get into it... but one day I had nothing to do and gave it another shot....\nI'm so glad i did. The saga Taylor has created, will live on as the greatest modern westerns. Since around tombstone eara, westerns then had a big decline. Eastwood stopped acting in them with his last one in the 90s that I can't recall the name of... perhaps redemption ?TL;DR\nThis is another feather in the cap for the greatest show runner currently alive, with hands on witting and directing 3 currently running series. With one in its 5th season... never in the history of TV or film have extremely high production prequels with star cast members ever been put out so fast? 3 more series within 6 years.Mr Sheridan, I hope I'm spelling that properly\nYou've done something incredible with your 4 series within 5 years.. from SOA Sheriff to being up there in the top 5 best tv show runners of all time. I can't imagine how busy you are.If the series goes bad I'll update my score and review. But I highly doubt it will get worse from here.. just only get better.","rating":"9\/10","date":"18 December 2022"}
{"title":"ABSOLUTELY FANTASTIC!","review":"After ready comments. I do want to say 1923 has everything to do with the story line from 1883 and also in the future Yellowstone. People who say they dont get how the relate, well sorry for you,, but you just dont get it.. Africa story line and all of Spencer's adventures are him escapeing his own torment, what dont you get.. about Spencer and his running from his own pain. PTSD! I GET IT 100%. Helen Merrin is the best I've seen her. The story lines for all the characters is awsome. My favorite is Spencer and Alex's love story. Its so real. Their totally opposites, but know each other so well. Brandon Sklenar is great in this role, as (Spencer) a very humble-troubled young man with thoughts of the war he fought and how it hunts him. You really feel for him watching his pain. Alex is a girl after my own heart. Very smart, had a mind of her own. I love it. Their a great story, that needs in my opinion to end the story together and happy. After all the tragedies of \"1883\" and \"Yellowstone \". 1923 needs to end on a good note! An excellent show.

We watched episodes seven and eight last night and as the credits rolled for the season finale my wife and looked and each other and said 'is that it?' It'll be interesting to see how season 2 shapes up as the whole of season 1 seemed to be laying the foundations for it.Both Helen Mirren's and Jerome Flynn's accents I found to be distracting. Just cast Irish and Scottish actors to those roles as they just didn't work.It just didn't feel as well written, in terms of both the story and the characters and the 'big names' weren't enough to carry it over the line.","rating":"7\/10","date":"5 November 2023"}
{"title":"Gets Better as it goes","review":"This had a rough first episode. First, cowboys sitting in board meetings and town halls talking about sheep and cow grazing rights. Pretty boring.Then when there was drama and conflict, it didn't ring entirely true. While I appreciate the coverage of the schools that Natives were forced into and the horrors that were forced upon them because it should not be forgotten history, Taylor Sheridan just kind of throws together scenes of drama and violence for drama and violence sake. It doesn't always track. Eventually though, the characters will pull you in and I'm a sucker for westerns, so by the midway point, I was invested. Do I wish there was more attention to the writing and the plotholes and inconsistencies and historical errors? Yeah. But I'm still entertained at least.","rating":"6\/10","date":"13 December 2023"}

I am so fed up at seeing Teonna's face being pounded and now with Timothy Dalton's scene with the two prostitutes, yeah, sorry, totally unnecessary.There's something so cras and beligerent about this kind of story telling. I don't need to see the detailed violence against Teonna in order to believe that this is happening to her and has happened to many others. I don't need to see Timothy Dalton coercing a prostitute into beating her colleague whilst he watches, to know that his character is (also) a mysoginist. Its condescending and unimaginative to tell the story this way. There must be another way to do it.But perhaps not. Maybe it's just old fashioned titillation of the same kind of audience member you seem so keen to please.I have to wonder at the integrity of people taking part in these scenes. Really?

{"title":"too much graphic violence","review":"I loved 1883 even though there was a lot of violence. The level of graphic violence in 1923 seems excessive. It is important to show how indigenous people were\/are treated by the \"church\", by church run schools AND one does not have to actually show people\/children being beaten and kicked and dehumanized to make the point. I turn the volume off at those moments, or walk into another room but still my nervous system is violated as well. Seeing people brutalized is harmful to the viewers as well. There are other ways to make the statement. I may have to just stop and sometime read the plot. The acting is excellent - but too too violent.","rating":"","date":"20 February 2023"}

The characters are so compelling and the way it's filmed this absolutely breathtaking and exciting. There were many times in the African scenes where I just had to pick my job off the floor really really well done ! Highly recommend it and definitely waiting for season two to drop!

{"title":"World Class","review":"As a fan or Taylor Sheridans Yellowstone universe 1923 is a need to watch as well as 1883. Only problem with the series is the episodes seems too short. But that might be the addiction talking because you get swollowed up in the storyline and all the characters.A HUGE and brilliant move is the use of Elsa Mays voice making you feel her characters spirit watching from Heaven over her family.Whole show has not yet been released but seems like the drama is just as intense as usual after a solid storyline and character build up the first 3 episodes. Think we are in for a ride and can not wait for the next episode.","rating":"9\/10","date":"30 January 2023"}
{"title":"Lose Yourself in Near-perfection","review":"Writer and creator Taylor Sheridan has done it again with his trademark brilliant filmmaking. Just how good is Sheridan? Good enough to entice two more from Hollywood's monarchy into his fold: Harrison Ford and Helen Mirren. Ford has such strong presence, and Mirren is so good you'll forget she's acting. Add a solid supporting cast that includes fantastic narration by Isabel May (of 1883 fame), a great storyline, and great technicals like the musical score and cinematography, and you won't stand a chance: you'll be lost in this wonderful production. A one-hour episode will seem to end before it begins.I write this review after just four episodes. I crave more while lamenting the season's end after another four episodes. But at least there will be a second season, unlike 1883, a show so good that I and so many others were disappointed to see it end after a single season.I cannot recommend a series more strongly than I do this one.","rating":"10\/10","date":"8 January 2023"}
{"title":"Helen miren is a fox","review":"Helen Miren is an amazing actress. Tyler Sheridan is a genius. He keeps creating outstanding entertainment I can't wait to see what is next. I like how the scenery is center stage. The back story and character development is fabulous. I enjoy seeing the evolution of the Dutton family in parallel to America. There are several stories intertwined which make less than A list actors hugely important to the series. The emphasis on the plight of native Americans is just right. No politics, just perspective. Tyler doesn't go heavy on politics but give a great view of what it might have been like for natuve people. This series along with 1883 and Yellowstone give us a glimpse of what true freedom looks like.","rating":"9\/10","date":"27 December 2022"}
{"title":"WOW! WOW! WOW!","review":"I'm completely blown away with this series. Fantastic story, brutal scenes of violence, humour and realistic events that these people endured in that era. I was thoroughly entertained from start to finish. Harrison Ford & Helen Mirren together is just pure poetry. I cried, laughed and was constantly gripped by each episode. The only thing that let it down, just a little for me, was the dragging out of the brother trying to get home. The violence was horrific but I feel it was necessary to show just how barbaric things were for the Native Americans especially. It truly broke my heart. So excited for season 2!! Very well done guys. The best thing I've watched in a very long-time.","rating":"10\/10","date":"14 April 2023"}
{"title":"Another good series from Sheridan","review":"Another good series by Taylor Sheridan, everything is good, scenery, filming, costume design.Fantastic cast apart from Robson Jerome playing the part of a Scotsman. Surely with the budget and big names like Harrison Ford and Dame Helen Mirren the producers could have managed to get a real Scottish actor to play the part. Jerome's take on a Scottish accent is ridiculous and embarrassing.But too late now I just hace to grit my teeth as he destroys the Scottish language.Aprt from that lol, it's a damn good show.Harrison Ford plays it very well as the main character.The Kenya scenes are good sadly let down by the cgi leopards.","rating":"8\/10","date":"29 December 2022"}
{"title":"Great show, when it sticks to the story.","review":"I enjoyed 1888 and, of course, Yellowstone but this show stretches episodes with unnecessary sex scenes. Stick to the story. It's great enough without all of that fluff. Honestly, the additional 3 minutes are not worth it.As for the rest of each episode, I am enjoyong each part of the story. The interactions between Jacob and Cara are amazing. Teonna's journey is mesmerizing. And, Spencer and Alex have had one of this most exciting and unfortunate adventures that has aired in recent years. I can't wait to see how all the stories eventually merge and explode onto the screen.Best if luck with the strikes. Hope to see you back on the schedule soon.","rating":"7\/10","date":"30 October 2023"}
{"title":"Captivating","review":"This series is beautifully Written. It is one of the most tragic Stories I have ever watched. It is definitely It is full of suspense & uncertainty. Despite the tragic events these characters\nendure you'll find they still have the ability to love, no matter thick their skin is, all the while fighting to stay alive. It's hard for me to explain how this made me feel. All I can say is, with everything that we have going on today It doesn't compare to \"Anything\" that they went through. Watching this series I was able to feel Is they're Struggle and feel their pain. It definitely made me reflect on my life and the things that I've had to face it doesn't compare. There's so many great characters in this series I have many favorites.","rating":"10\/10","date":"8 January 2023"}
{"title":"Not Sheridan's best","review":"I suggest you watch 1883 and then 1923 (and yes, I watched them twice) back to back. The contrast is striking and not in a good way for 1923. The story seems paper thin compared to 1883 and the absolutely only things that redeems this series in the least is the amazing presence of Helen Mirren and Harrison Ford. Also worth mentioning is Brandon Sklenar. Other than that, there is not much there there, as sadly evidenced by extremely long scenes of sex, sadism and cruelty. These awful scenes seem to provide a \"filler\" but not much else and on top of that, the scenes are simply offensive. I sincerely hope that Mr. Sheridan can improve upon the story in season 2. I adore all things \"Taylor Sheridan\" but this series was disappointing.","rating":"7\/10","date":"4 March 2023"}
{"title":"Wasted 3 months of my life waiting for something to happen. Nothing.","review":"What an utter waste of a show. 1883 was great, but this heap of nothing just strings you along at a mind-numbingly glacial pace for 8 long, arduous episodes of violence porn, gore and sado-masochistic fetishism.Nothing is resolved. Disparate, confusing, purposeless, unrelated story lines never converge.Harrison Ford's Dutton is a self-centered murderer, killing everyone that doesn't bow to his family. Helen Mirren tries to imbue her character with a voice, but is ultimately ignored and put in her place by Ford's Dutton. Timothy Dalton's character is a disgusting, sick, monster of a human being. I can't even. I really don't care about any of these caricatures, I mean characters.The entire religious order of priests and nuns, every single one of them, are beating, raping and murdering all the children, just because, you know, the native \"mongrels\" are all demon-possessed.Native grandmothers and Asian moms are casually kicked, beaten, taken from their families by the \"lawmen\" and \"accidentally\" murdered.This show holds lawlessness up as some kind of virtue. The piles of bodies and blood never ends. And it's all irrational and illogical.Ford's character says it best: \"Hope is the surrender of authority to your fate, and trusting it to the whims of the wind. My family does not hope.\" Well, take that advice and don't hold out any hope for this show. Go do something else with your time. Anything at all.","rating":"1\/10","date":"27 February 2023"}
{"title":"Great potential let down","review":"The show is great, three separate storylines with a sense they're I'll eventually intertwine.I did really enjoy the first season but it's let down by the ending. The story builds but doesn't even remotely come together by the final episode, I know they probably plan a second season and shows often end on a cliff hanger to engage audiences for the second season but this first season builds and builds a story and then just ends. My recommendation would be to wait for season two and binge what will then be a great show. If you've seen the new dune movie you'll understand the feeling that they've released something not as a story but as an introduction.Season 2 should be great if they can bring it together but I'm just a little disappointed I watched season 1 so early, would of been better to come upon this as season 2 was being released.","rating":"8\/10","date":"5 March 2023"}
{"title":"Sheridan continues to dominate","review":"Ten years ago who would've thought Taylor Sheridan would be the powerhouse of entertainment that he is today. After putting out Hell or High Water I knew we were in for some great projects but never would I have imagined the broad scope. 1923 does NOT disappoint. Maybe I keep expecting to be let down but his shows have continued to shine through the other dribble. Harrison Ford and Helen Mirren are near perfection in an aged married couple role that are tough as nails. Surviving in a time period of dog eat dog to secure your families legacy they are at the top of their game. The side story across the ocean with Spencer fighting his own war and finding love only adds to the overall greatness. Paramount has also utilized the \"bring em back\" next week which seems to be working nicely once again for networks. The binge is gone. Oh well, I'll be back next week. Cheers.","rating":"9\/10","date":"19 January 2023"}
{"title":"Good not Great","review":"I have mixed feelings on 1923. I think it tells the continuing saga of the Dutton family in a good way. But I have issues with a few things. I agree with others that the gratuitous whipping sex scenes of the 2 prostitutes seem to just be thrown in the mix for really no purpose. It isn't important to the storyline-yes we get it-men we're sadists and brutes-but how does that pertain to the Duttons? It really doesn't. Don't know what or why Sheridan wanted to say with those scenes except to shock. The other violence in the story is the brutality of the natives at the hands of the Catholic schools. It was very hard to watch those scenes. But as it relates to Teonna Rainwater and does fit in the current Yellowstone storyline it seems more fitting to include that terrible dark history that was forced upon the nations tribes. I'm on the fence about the focus on Spencer Dutton and his British bride. I like Spencer but sometimes this veered off into too much soapiness. More focus on the two main characters would be nice. Love seeing Harrison Ford and Helen Mirren together.","rating":"8\/10","date":"11 June 2023"}
{"title":"First Season Good, But Some Disturbing Christian Bashing","review":"Just like Yellowstone and 1883, 1923 follows with some quite excellent acting, directing and special effects. With the series split into 3 different plot directions it makes for a constantly changing focus that was accomplished with perfection. The scenes in Africa were absolutely outstanding in every way. You really got the feel of that part of the series. The Montana scenes were equally good with both older actors putting forth fantastic performances. The Native American scenes were done well, too...but this is where I thought things went a bit wrong. In Yellowstone and 1883, we see both good and evil in the peoples and societies that the series focused on. However, for some reason, the writers\/directors decided to break with that tradition and show Christians as purely evil. I fully understand that Native Americans were treated poorly by peoples of the era and the so called \"Christian Schools\" were wrong in every way. But history tells us that there were some Christians within the clergy that opposed the harsh treatment of Native Americans during that time and most Christians were unaware of what was really going on. The depiction of Christians in 1923, however, really doesn't give a good example of this. It's way too one-sided, which is a departure from the first two series and I found it disturbing.","rating":"8\/10","date":"17 May 2023"}

{"title":"Another brilliant Yellowstone spinoff","review":"Dame Helen Mirren and Harrison Ford. Sounds like a winning recipe. And it is. The Duttons are once again struggeling to keep their way of farmlife in Montana. The patriarch, (Harrison Ford) Jacob Dutton, is fighting pretty much the same battles as John Dutton (Costner) did in Yellowstone. Very entertaining.There are two other very interesting archs to the story. One is Spencer Dutton. A disillusioned WW1 veteran. Now a hunter in Africa. Spencer meets an english girl whom he liked. Suddenly those two learned that they had to travel from Mogadishu in Somalia to Montana. Should be easy...The second arch is told from a school where native American girls are abused by catholic priests and nuns. That part was highly unpleasant to watch. There was a bit of revenge going on there that made it somewhat watchable...I normally rate TV shows after 1 season. Not this time. I did not like the last episode. Explaining why would meen spoiling. But I'm going to watch season two. I have to...","rating":"","date":"18 January 2024"}
{"title":"Another Hit!","review":"GREAT, LOVED IT. Every episode gets better and more exciting. Every character has a great story and they connect with 1883 and Yellowstone (in the future). My favorite is Spencer, how he's so broken from the war. He lost himself and its so obvious Cara (Helen Miren) his aunt has great love and respect for him and what he went through. She depends on him now in a way she knows he'll get things done in winning their range war when he gets home. I hope his story line continues with Alex, they have such good chemistry. After all they have been through , I hope there together and happy in the end of all of this!!!!","rating":"10\/10","date":"12 January 2023"}
{"title":"Sheridan has run his course for me","review":"First of all, I have really enjoyed a lot of Sheridan's prior work. Wind River is incredible, Sicario, Hell or High Water etc.1923 has a Wonderful cast. Gorgeous scenery. Pretty good story as well, despite a few critics on this point.But, it's all been said & done before from Taylor. His dark, grim nihilism and even postmodernist view of morality grows tiresome and depressing. Just pseudo-darwinian \"survival of the fittest\" played out in graphic detail. There is no right or wrong, only power. Logically, this leads to also being no objective truth. We just create \"narrative\" and we are locked into our own tribes.It seems hard to escape his bleak nihilistic themes in all the Yellowstone works, The Mayor of Kingstown, etc. It runs through everything he touches.In the end, there is nothing inspiring about throwing people into a dark pit and seeing which ones can destroy the others and survive.","rating":"6\/10","date":"26 February 2023"}
{"title":"Generally an enjoyable show","review":"I've just finished the last episode and I am saying, \"No No No!\" in my head. Ending on that cliff hanger is sad, but at least Alex is getting all the romantic adventure she could ever imagine. (And then some.... lions, sharks, and duels Oh my!)This show has the quintessential things Sheridan likes.*Power through corruption\n*Crossing morals\/laws while still fighting on the \"good\" side\n*America brutally beating down and wronging Native Americans\n*Violence\n*Rugged burly men with swagger being the real \"man's man\"\n*Women sacrificing themselves for love, to make their men better, and to make strong families\nAnd of course\n*Corny romanceSpeaking on the romance - there are a lot of captivating things about Alex. She is passionate, fully committed, adventurous. Some things don't make sense to me though. She is domineering and shows a lot of grit and decisiveness, but then became a screaming, bawling pile in the face of death. I'm not saying that I wouldn't be a screaming, bawling pile myself, but I think someone with that much determination and dominance would pull themselves together better. I know her lack of experience in dire situations would make it extra challenging, but she'd still be capable of taking part in on surviving. Also, her screaming was more like screeching and her bawling was definitely the ugly cry kind.I know that Spencer doesn't talk much and likes to be the observer, but I feel liked his acting needed to show more feeling\/love towards Alex. When they are intimate it is all kinds of steamy and passionate, but the other times don't really convey much from him.I love how the gal acting as Alex gets teary eyed in deeply emotional moments - not just when she's sad. I suspect that the actress is showing real tears and it impresses me. She definitely is the right actress to show the passionate emotions of this character. We all have to wonder how Alex will handle daily life on the ranch with no electricity, no running water, and the demands of cooking\/cleaning.I like the storyline following the Native American young ladies in the school that is trying to scrub all native out of them and just leave behind Americans. I am aware that those types of schools really existed, but I think the show overdid the school beatings and the villainous clergy. I eye-rolled at times because it was so cliche.The same can be said for the villainous, powerful, rich dude (Timothy Dalton) in Wyoming. I laughed when the men were blowing up a mine and Dalton walked away from the mine with his back to it as plumes of smoke and debris were flying up in the air. He walked away with all the bravado filmed in action flicks to show the he is so strong, so powerful, so in control that not even a big explosion can touch him. Oh come on!Setting aside these cliche and corny moments, I enjoyed the show. The acting is really well done which is to be expected with Harrison Ford and Helen Mirren. I will definitely be watching season 2.","rating":"8\/10","date":"5 May 2023"}
{"title":"Soap opera in a cowboy hat","review":"The show is good but as soon as it starts moving along the writer slams on the breaks with some melodramatic love scene. It exists in two worlds. The first feels the need to attract the boys with gunfights and horse riding while the other saturates the story with love scenes for the ladies. It's almost like two writers wrote the different worlds because they are so stark in tone but I guess it's all just Taylor Sheridan. Yellowstone and 1893 had a similar action\/romance dynamic but 1923 cranks the romance up to 11.They could have trimmed an episode or two out of the first season and it would have been much tighter.","rating":"7\/10","date":"17 July 2023"}
{"title":"Utterly Implausible Nonsense!","review":"I wanted to like this show but can't look past the poor attention to detail and corny storyline.It reminds me of the Wilbur Smith novels I read as a young teenager. The storyline is a typical formulaic semi-bodice ripper and far too romanticised.The accents of some of the characters are terrible. Jerome Flynn can't pull off a Scottish accent to save his life. Julia Shlaepfer sounds either British, German or Scandinavian and her accent changes from scene to seen. I wont even start on her lack of acting ability.Attention to detail is pathetic. Driving on an unpaved road in Africa where the motor vehicle glides along smoothly? That doesn't happen in modern times let alone in 1923! Take a look at the road they drive on too. The tyre tracks match exactly those of a modern vehicle and not the much narrower width and tyre size a Ford Model T (or whatever they're in). Lions don't hunt at night either. Nor do hyenas get into fights with lions on a kill if they can possibly help it.The scenes set in the US are just as bad. Gunsmoke is everywhere during shootout scenes except when it would get in the way of the camera shot - then it mysteriously doesn't doesn't happen.I suspect many viewers are unable to see past the star quality of Harri and Dame Hels. Lucky them! I wish I could. The producers must have blown their budget on these two salaries and had nothing left for vocal trainers, better actors, writers or cinematographers who weren't straight out of film school.Such BS it hurts my eyes to watch. 3 episodes was enough.","rating":"5\/10","date":"13 February 2023"}

It had many good and bad qualities that left it just flat with the fans. Not a waste of time, but still lacking.Here comes 1923! Holly Hell! Everything about this show is shaping up to be a short run massive award winner. It has the amazing story. It has the amazing talent.

{"title":"Magnificent","review":"I have never been a big fan of Westerns ....have always and only just reminded me of the cruelty of \"white supremacists\", the civilised people as we call ourselves and of how rare our actions, it has made it for us to meet a real Native American with their incredible amount of customs, rituals and wiseness, as we have done to most if not all, other tribal peoples around the world.However, Taylor Sheridan has really taken this to another level of casting, scripting and screenwriting, voiceovers, music and....locations...the land, oh my God the land. Simply magnificent. I am amazed this was not based on some best seller. Film for Film. The way we used to do it.Trying to find the script of 1823 to read as we speak, as probably it was my favourite out of three, and am devastated that 1923 season 2 is not out yet and neither is Yellowstone season 5 part 2!

The addition of major star power the likes of Helen Mirren and Harrison Ford doesn't hurt either. It 's a shame there will be only one more season.All the characters are interesting because we see, as in real life, nobody is all good and all bad. The writing, acting, cinematography, production design, and set decoration are impeccable.The devolution of the appearance of the Dutton homestead from Yellowstone to this series is skillfully done and ties the generations together just as does the dialogue.This is must-watch television.

Liked it much more than Yellowstone due to the better acting and interesting plot with its twists and turns.Impossible to get bored watching this I can assure you.Disappointed it ended so soon.Seems Taylor Sheridan is very good at his job, based on the many series he's produced and directed.Hope there's going to be a season 2.","rating":"9\/10","date":"7 April 2023"}

Helen Mirren is at her best in this role. Carra and Jacobs relationship is my goal for my older age. They are a force and stronger together and they know it. I love that Jacob, with all his strength is man enough to know who he married and just who the boss is. Spencer and Alex are so fun and the chemistry is electric. They are the Carra and Jacob of the future. Their return to Yellowstone is going to be fun. Unfortunately we have to wait a month to find out. Im feeling a bit upset about that.

{"title":"Very silly","review":"I enjoyed Mayor of Kingstown, quite liked 1883, and have heard good things about Yellowstone, so I looked forward to 1923. I'm not impressed. Some of the casting is very good but the characters are very black-and-white in a way that feels silly and caricature-ish. The Catholic nuns and priests are so unremittingly evil that they should have little horns on their heads, or perhaps forked tails. (Just in case you didn't get the extremely blatant message, Catholicism is evil, folks.) The Dutton men are all uber-masculine, especially the young Duttons, whose muscles ripple in the sunlight and whose women run adoringly across the grass to meet them, perhaps dressed in flowing white garments through which the last light of the setting sun shines, making them glow like angels. The women have no interest in the world other than to make the wonderful Dutton men happy and to be loved by them. To these women, their own deaths would be as nothing. The death of their man, however - well, after that, how could life be worth living? There is lots of looking deep into each other's eyes and kissing as the dusk falls.Mainly my thoughts as I was watching were: Spencer is gorgeous (and if gorgeous Spencer is enough for you, then, by all means, watch this show, and, yes, he does spend a lot of time without a shirt), it's unfair to the rest of us women that Helen Mirren is still this pretty, and Timothy Dalton is much more fun to watch than I ever gave him credit for.You might enjoy this show but you have to accept an awful lot of silliness if you do watch it.","rating":"6\/10","date":"26 February 2023"}
{"title":"Taylor Sheridan delivers again","review":"Taylor Sheridan delivers again, picking a monumental period in history. This entire season is set in an amazing era when the ancient world fell away and the roller coaster ride toward modernity began. We can see the seeds of the world today being sown, and of course, the writers take pains to inject wisdom and warnings about the state of affairs today, especially freedom of thought, speech and the pursuit of happiness. The Dutton family is aptly tough as nails, a clear carry over from the struggles of 1883 and carry forward to the ongoing saga of Yellowstone.Salute to Taylor's courage to explore the painful history of North America after the physical genocide of natives, namely their cultural genocide through church schools, associated humiliation, and many unmarked graves. This issue has barely been addressed in popular media. More historical wrongs are unearthed every year, so this issue needs to be highlighted and reconciled.The Kenya storyline is sweeping and romantic, taking me back to the glory of Out of Africa. Having spent my childhood there, I was enamoured by the accuracy and authenticity of the storyline. The great pains taken to reproduce Africa of the period were truly impressive. The romance between Spencer and Alexandra is for ages and makes one feel alive, and immersed in destiny.The calibre of the acting is just top class, especially from Ford, Mirren and Dalton. What gravitas and finesse. It is clear this tale is a multi-season arc of survival and greed, of revenge and ambition. Can't wait to see it unfold.","rating":"10\/10","date":"11 May 2023"}
{"title":"Good Actors, Good Photography, Depressing Story","review":"I am mostly impressed with Taylor Sheridan writing. We loved 1883 except for the ending, and Wind River except again maybe not the ending, haven't watched Yellowstone, but like Tulsa King so far.But we are on the third episode and although acting is very good and photography is great, but the story is mostly depressing and after seeing the Indian girl beaten for the third time, and we already know the depressing story of how the children were taken from their families and forced to live like the white people, seeing it again and the war between the sheep raisers and the cattlemen, it's just all too depressing. I couldn't help but wonder why Irishman would take a look at Montana Prairie and think that sheep could survive there after seeing them properly raised in the green fields and valleys of Ireland. And why they would ever attempt such a huge herd.Maybe we'll come back and give the story another try, the characters seem good and will developed, and I hope are more positive times in the story soon. My mother was born in 1913 and it wasn't easy living on the Colorado Prairie either, and I'm sure my grandfather and grandmother suffered through being immigrants from Lithuania in towns mostly run by English descendants. Even now, the Lithuanians aren't even mentioned in the town history where my mother was born and my grandfather worked the mines when he wasn't trying to farm. But they had left before Russia went through the big revolution, hoping for a better life here, like the Irish sheep herders. And they retained their sense of fun and love and found good things in the world to celebrate.Im just not enjoying the dark picture Taylor Sheridan is painting of thid time in Montana. Maybe he doesn't like to look on or at the bright side of life.","rating":"7\/10","date":"18 March 2023"}

This show doesn't hold a candle to the previous two shows, and I'm having a hard time staying focused. The oldest son looks like he's never going to get home, and the range war is at hand. Cut some of the scenes, and the nudity, as they are not necessary. If this is a one season show, they need to get to the chase. The bad reviews are getting more prevalent, and that's a shame since the show had a lot of promise. Now I hear Costner is about to leave Yellowstone. But we shall see. It's a typical problem of writing in a hurry, and painting one's self into a corner.","rating":"4\/10","date":"21 February 2023"}
{"title":"Why?","review":"Yes! Yes! Yes! To all the One Star Reviews. Unlike some of the others, I enjoyed \"1883\", and I enjoy \"Yellowstone\". Neither are to be taken too seriously, but highly entertaining for what they are. That said, all the petty faults I might find with \"1883\" & \"Yellowstone\", are the very foundation of \"1923\".I had no idea who the people in \"1923\" are or what they had to do with the ones in the previous related series. So, I looked up the Dutton family tree in an effort to better follow the characters, and I am still in a state of confusion.After two episodes, the Africa storyline still seems to have no connection to the Montana storyline??? Nor is there any apparent relationship between Spencer Dutton (Africa) and his uncle Jacob Dutton (Montana). Also, I kept wondering if the blonde elder lady in \"1923\" was one of the younger \"yellow hairs\" or the mother of one of them. Constantly, looking for some connection. Oh well.The depiction of the treatment of the indigenous native girls at the hands of the Nuns is just plain \"horror\". I have no idea if this part of the story actually happened, but I find it \"Squeamish\". So so uncomfortable to watch, with no clear motivation other than the Nun is tremendously mean, and the native girl is exceptionally angry. Meaningless banality!Will I continue to watch? Who knows? Can it get better? I love Helen Mirren, but she is miscast in this show. Harrison Ford doesn't work for me either.1923 is just a mean show with mean people, in what I was looking forward to being a link in an extended number of series of historical fiction about America West. Again, oh well.","rating":"8\/10","date":"30 December 2022"}
{"title":"The Ghost of Dick Van Dyke haunts you","review":"The accents are terrible. There should be no excuses. The 1883 attempted German accents were enough shame. Did they learn nothing? The current title holder for the worst Scottish accent ever, from Scotty on Star Trek is under threat here. Dame Helen Mirren does English so well, why she would lower her delivery with a half baked Irish accent is a shame.Directorially the spacious scenery footage competes with Michael Cimino's Heavens Gate. The natural beauty of the setting is superb, but should not be the selling point of the cinematography. Not sure a heavy weight import is going to carry this.","rating":"8\/10","date":"25 December 2022"}
{"title":"Good except for some of the accents","review":"I have been following Taylor Sheridan's epic tales since Yellowstone and admired the authenticity, the truer telling of the story and great attention to detail. However Jerome Flynn being cast as a Scotsman is a very poor choice. I don't think he's a great actor anyway but his accent is truly awful. There are plenty of really good Scottish actors who could have played the role or someone who can actually do a passable accent. When non Scot's actors try to speak Scot's they extend all the vowels - as if they all are trying to imitate Billy Connolly, forgetting that his was for comedic effect: and exaggeration when doing stand up. Helen Mirren's Irish accent isn't perfect but she plays the role so well that you forgive it.The nuns and the priests are truly awful and it makes me angry to consider these poor beautiful girls being treated so inhumanely. If ever there was an argument against celibacy in the clergy surely that's it- if they had all enjoyed a good ravaging now and again maybe those beautiful girls wouldn't have been subjected to such hellish abuse from their twisted understanding of God.","rating":"8\/10","date":"21 March 2023"}

{"title":"Two stories ... one outstanding, and one hilarious!","review":"In series one, there are two stories ... one outstanding, and one hilarious, but possibly not intended.The first story in the the American west is outstanding! From the European immigrant farmers, to the American Indians being hounded by a deeply evil bunch of Catholic priests, also a evil sheep herd (I kid you not!) and yes, of course, an evil land baron!The second story takes the cake! I must have been written by someone else. It is weird, and could be a series Monty Python clips, with unintended humour! Let me mention a few examples: The American game hunter hero, in Africa (Spencer), who is badly gored by a lion. With a bottle of booze, on his wounds, and a drink or two, and within days he is drinking at the country club, and within hours, he drives off with a Julia, who just met, and who (Julia) was in the process of being engaged by a member of the English royal family. A few days later Spencer takes Julia for a walk in the country, where they are attacked by a pride of lions (again), and where they escape by a tree. The two of them then start to travel to America by a series of boats trips, during which their first ship sinks, then are married in the second ship (with a following \"Titanic\" love scene on the tip of the bow). Fortunately, the boat did not hit an iceberg, given there it was off Africa. In the third ship Spencer (no relation to Diana's family, I assume) has a sword duel with Julia's ex-lover member of the Royal Family, on the deck. Things go badly for the ex-lover, who falls into the sea (the Goon Show's Little Jim would now say \"He's fallen in the water!') Anyway, at the end of the first series, Spencer is removed from the ship (not thrown in the water, but via by a lifeboat) without his wife, because the Captain explains that as Spencer has been badly behaved to a member of the Royal Family, and that the ship was named for the Royal Family (but paid for by taxpayers), he cannot be allowed continue the cruise. And, this all happens in a few days! So, he's still stuck in Africa, while his American family are pining for his return, to fight agains the evil land-baron mentioned above. We await for the second series, with bated breath!","rating":"8\/10","date":"13 March 2023"}
{"title":"Wonderful","review":"Beautifully shot, aimost entirely out on the planes of Montana, & what a stunning landscape. The huge Dutton lodge they call their home looks so out of place & pretentious that I almost wish it would burn down. This IS great TV but I expected more. The previous prequel 1825 ? Was brilliant. Loved every minute of it & it had a story to tell. In this one ...the latest I think, although I hate to say it, Taylor Sheridan might be running out of words or story. Sad to say 2 of the biggest disappointments are Harrison Ford & Helen Mirren. Not because they've aged, that's great. But I struggle to understand a word they say. And neither of them is convincing in their role. In contrast the young lovers of Spencer & Elizabeth ? Are wonderful. They could easily play a young Harrison & Helen..the chemist ry between the young couple is amazing to see. Why are there only 8 Episodes.","rating":"8\/10","date":"22 March 2023"}

At the rate it is going boat boy is going to get home just in time for 1973 season 1.The problem is that there is no real story outside of the standard bad guys want to steal the farm trope and Yellowstone has already beaten that dead horse to hamburger.It's watchable and mostly enjoyable but they are just trying to squeeze too many episodes out of not enough story.","rating":"7\/10","date":"1 March 2023"}

{"title":"Very good, but some flaws","review":"There is no denying that Sheridan is talented and prolific. Although I haven't watched much of Yellowstone (might get back to it one day), I absolutely adored 1883. The voiceover was tiring at times but everything else blew me away and moved me to tears, and Sam Elliott played a big part in this. I had therefore high hopes for 1923 and they have been largely met with good stories and acting, but not much emotion unfortunately and a few failed characters. The main reason for the 7 is how little I cared about Spencer and his girl, I ended up fast-forwarding through almost all their scenes abroad as they were too annoying. The rest was good.","rating":"7\/10","date":"26 July 2023"}
{"title":"Dreadful in just about every way","review":"What a disappointment these prequels have turned out to be. Yellowstone is enjoyable enough for what it is: a ridiculous melodrama with absolutely ludicrous characters and plot lines, but these prequels really just set fire to any notion that it's \"good TV.\" It's not \"good TV,\" but it passes for that to mainstream America since most other shows are execrable at the moment and since mainstream taste by nature tends toward the lowest common denominator.The acting is just silly in some cases. The British aristocracy, in particular, are extremely overblown caricatures.Alexandra is probably the single most insufferable female character I've ever witnessed on any screen. Never in my life have I seen a character who was written so smugly and entirely enamored of their own (very slight) cleverness. I cannot abide her and I find myself wishing for her demise every time she's on the screen. She's not cute, she's intensely obnoxious.None of the other characters are written well, either. This show is pretty low effort when you break it all down. I don't even know why I'm bothering, though, as the people who rate this show 10\/10 will just mark it as unhelpful. So whatever. Bad show, don't bother unless you REALLY NEED to know the backstory to Yellowstone.","rating":"4\/10","date":"27 February 2023"}

A very well in depth, well thought out combination of story lines each with there own satisfying degree of intensity, I couldn't get enough to the point where I was left flabbergasted at the end of episode 8, convinced that there was an episode 9 round the corner only to learn I've got to wait till probably the end of 2023 early 2024 for the next instalment, boooo! The only criticism I'd have which is basically a sense of my own personal gratification, is that when Season 2 is released, please release the whole season at once, I really struggle having to wait a week for each episode which causes me to have to wait even longer until all episodes are available for streaming.

The other one you wanted to keep watching but when you think about it there's no real story except ugh more words there's not even a real script.

The storylines on the ranch, on African safari and a native American \"school\" have been largely separate so I'm looking forward to seeing how they weave them together.Julia's character, Alexandra, is great - really expressive. Her German accent is quite obvious to a Brit though. I'd have kept the actress but tweaked her storyline to explain the Germanic twang.If you struggled to get into Yellowstone, I'd still give the origin series a chance. I couldn't get into Yellowstone series 1, only returned to it after enjoying 1883 and 1923 so much and now I'm hooked on that too!","rating":"8\/10","date":"14 January 2023"}
{"title":"1923 is a slow burner but the tension never breaks nor does Taylor Sheridan's writing, Ford and Mirren is brilliant as Jacob and Cara Dutton - My Ultimate Review","review":"Taylor Sheridan have created yet another brilliant western drama set in the Yellowstone universe. It's a sequel to 1883 and a prequel to Yellowstone, which follows a generation of the Dutton family in 1923, during a time of various hardships including Prohibition, drought, and the early stages of the Great Depression, which affected Montana long before the 1929 Stock Market Crash.There's two big storylines and one smaller, each with great writing and significance. Let's start with the biggest plot and what 1923 truly is about, it's about the Yellowstone Ranch where patriarch Jacob Dutton (Harrison Ford), whom are the older brother of James Dutton, and matriarch Cara Dutton (Helen Mirren), who raised John and Spencer Dutton as their own as they had no children of their own. John Dutton (James Badge Dale) being the oldest son of James and Margaret whilst Spencer (Brandon Sklenar) was their youngest. That's what the second storyline is about, Spencer had witnessed the horrors of World War I and travels Africa to track big game. There's two love stories in the first season but that's my favorite one. The other being the one about Jack Dutton (Darren Mann) and Elizabeth \"Liz\" Strafford (Michelle Randolph), Jack being John Dutton Sr.'s son and only child. Each is different and as powerful, but the romance between Spencer and Alexandra (Julia Schlaepfer) is my favorite and might be the universe's best after Beth and Rip, it's true love and you see it sincerely. But before I write about the third and final storyline, we have to write about the threat which the Dutton family is up against, it's Donald Whitfield (Timothy Dalton) who's a powerful and wealthy business tycoon, but also Banner Creighton (Jerome Flynn) who's a Scottish sheepherder and adversary of the Duttons. The smaller storyline could be seen as filler because of how it's focusing about a rebellious young American Indian woman who was taken from her family and placed in an Indian boarding school for girls run by the Catholic Church and the horrors we see her go through is actually things that actually happened behind close doors. Students were systematically stripped of their languages, customs, and culture. Even accounts of neglect, abuse and death at these schools which is some of the things we get to see through Teonna Rainwater's perspective (Aminah Nieves) and if you recognize the surname, this could very well be the grandmother of Chief Thomas Rainwater from Yellowstone.Ben Richardson directed episodes 1-4 and returned to direct 7-8, whilst Guy Ferland directed 5-6. Having the same director means that the vision of Taylor Sheridan will be concurrent, I personally think the two directors did a phenomenal job, Ben Richardson being the one who directed my favorite episodes and I hope these two returns for the next season if not Richardson taking rein of all the episodes. The direction and visual storytelling is all fantastic. I think the writing too is fantastic but felt like it dove in quality during the last two episodes, I think highly of Sheridan and making the antagonists one-divensional like that wasn't what I expected, though I think the writing was better in the earlier episodes for the antagonists. I think the rest of the characters are all well written with great character arcs, making the villains seem like an after thought which is fine as it's easy to look past, the other characters wouldn't be easy to look past as they are the ones we're rooting for. It is far from the rivalry John Dutton and Chief Thomas Rainwater has, but as I said, that's fine.What can I say about the acting? Other than that Helen Mirren and Harrison Ford as Cara Dutton and Jacob Dutton respectively, is really giving their A game here, their performances are one of 1923's many highlights. But the great acting doesn't stop there as the other lead actors like the supporting cast are all fantastic. Watching Brandon Sklenar become and act out the inner horrors of Spencer Dutton, it's a perfect performance and one of my favorites of this season. In a way, he's a character you could easily see yourself in, if you have been through something and have trauma. He captures the silent type and makes it all natural. Another performance I liked is Aminah Nieves as Teonna Rainwater, just because of how important her storyline is to the history, and just how raw it felt. You feel the emotions she's going through, the psychological horrors she's going through. Overall, a terrific performance which I hope will make her more known. On the antagonist side, I think Jerome Flynn was great as Banner Creighton before getting overshadowed by the great Timothy Dalton who brings a great performance to the role but also making him the threat the character is supposed to be. Let's finish this paragraph with some more praise towards Harrison Ford and Helen Mirren whose performances and chemistry on screen needs to earn them some critical acclaim and possibly some awards.The notable producers of the show are Taylor Sheridan, John Linson and Art Linson. The Linson brothers have produced all of the shows in the Yellowstone universe but also Sons of Anarchy and other films. I think the cast and crew, directors and writer, have combined their forces to create a show that might have the potential to stand alongside Yellowstone and 1883 in quality. Production design and art design, its terrific, the cinematography is perfect. I'm so happy that Taylor Sheridan got a much bigger budget, he said this \"I would argue that 1883 was the most expensive first season of a TV show ever made. This was much more expensive. Much more expensive.\" And the thing is, we notice that in every scene, the production is massive and they have created something brilliant. When 1923 is finished, I'm sure people will look back and call this a masterpiece.","rating":"10\/10","date":"10 March 2023"}
{"title":"Best casting choice since Tracy and Hepburn","review":"My Review- 1923\nStreaming on ParamountMy Rating 10\/10As I mentioned in my recent review of 1883 I haven't as yet seen Yellowstone the incredibly successful Western epic mini series created by Taylor Sheridan and John Linson that spawned the prequels 1883 and 1923.1883 followed the pioneering Dutton family history from the post -Civil war era as they made the perilous journey by wagon train from Fort Worth Texas to the great grassland plains of Montana1923 features the descendants of the Dutton family headed by rancher Jacob Dutton the brother of James Dutton played by Harrison Ford and his wife family matriarch Cara Dutton played by Helen Mirren .Every scene Harrison Ford and Helen Mirren are in together reminded me of possibly the most famous pairing in movie history Spencer Tracy and Katharine Hepburn.I say that as a sincere compliment to their artistry and chemistry together they are totally believable and I think their casting in 1923 is inspired.We see the Dutton's this time not on a perilous journey but involved in a fierce battle to save their beloved Yellowstone cattle ranch from sheep farmers trespassing to graze their flocks and unscrupulous land developers who see mining as the new highway to wealth and won't stop at any means to acquire the ranch.It's a very interesting era in America between the two world wars and the Great Depression where the post war boom time was about to end signalling the demise of many investors and land owners property and wealth .The most fascinating aspect of the story I found was the stark contrast of life and attitudes in the vast rural sparsely populated plains area of Montana at that time to the great populated cities of New York ,Chicago , San Francisco and Los Angeles where sky scrapers ,the movie industry and the roaring 20's would seem otherworldly to these ranchers and miners .The series 1923 actually helps me understand why America is the country it is today . Guns and rifles were and are still seen as the supreme right of each citizen , the result is still being seen in the violent gun crimes and indiscriminate shootings in America today .The series not only vividly depicts the inequality and cruelty that obviously still occurred in 1923 inflicted on Americas First Nations people by so called Christian educators to its justice system for crimes without trial.The story also explained to me why it's so difficult to bring guns reform to America when we witness James Dutton and his family's response to the sheep farming trespassers . Both parties revenge and use of guns just cause heartbreak and the last resort used by Dutton is lawful intervention.1923 also has the added ingredient of romance and exotic locations as we are introduced to Spencer the handsome son of James and Margaret Dutton (from 1883) played by Brandon Sklenar who is very impressive in a quiet but macho way.Spencer has been raised by his Uncle Jacob and Aunt Cara who were childless along with his older brother John on the Yellowstone ranch.Spencer after serving bravely in The Great War takes up big game hunting among other things in Africa and meets the beautiful English socialite Alexandra .They fall deeply in love and the glamorous Alexandra breaks off her engagement with the son of a British Earl.When Spencer is summoned to return home to Yellowstone by his desperate Aunt Cara he and Alexandra embark on their own perilous journey home by sea that in a way mirrors his own parents journey to Montana as far as danger is concerned.Enough of the plot I have to praise all the ensemble cast and producers of this entertaining series of epic proportions it's a credit to the creators and Directors\nBen Richardson who also directed Yellowstone and Mare of Easttown and Guy Ferland who directed 2 episodes.I will of course now watch Yellowstone even though it's five series that follows the sixth generation of the Dutton Family so it will be a while before I review Yellowstone.I'm so glad series 2 of 1923 has already been commissioned and can't wait to enjoy the pairing of Harrison Ford and Helen Mirren again they are so impressive.","rating":"10\/10","date":"11 April 2023"}
{"title":"Let down","review":"I watched S1-4 of Yellowstone, I was hesitant to start it but after like 4 episodes I was absolutely hooked, then when I was caught up to tv, it was mid way through S5 so I decided to watch 1883 and 1923 before I went back, 1883 took about 2 episodes for me to get hooked, and as for this, I am still waiting.I think this has to be one of the biggest slow burns of a season, nothing wrong with that but the problem is there is absolutely no Pay off for most characters and apparently there is a S2 on the way which I have 0 interest in.The rainwater storyline was the only one that had me, each episode I was hoping for more and more of that, the hatred I had for the priests and nuns, I was rooting for the native Americans and now I see why they hate the white folk, very justified. The love story was a joke, it was so slow, boring and unnecessary. The Yellowstone ranch scenes were okay, The Africa scenes were also a bore, obviously there are some great moments in the show but that's it, just some good moments, I don't think it was a good season, and if this is a limited series, dear god that's even worse.I am so unbelievably underwhelmed as I was so excited coming off the last 2 shows but this just isn't it. I wouldn't bother watching.","rating":"6\/10","date":"27 April 2023"}

Whether it be 1923, 1883, Mayor of Kingstown, Tulsa King or probably a dozen other projects. I seriously can't wait to see what his next projects could be. 1923 is a sequel to 1883 and is set in Montana in what appears to be some trying times for cattle ranchers. There's a few different plots going on but all are interesting. As usual Harrison Ford and Helen Mirren are flawless in their roles and the other actors seem to have been cast perfectly for their parts.

{"title":"1883, season 41","review":"I assume the rave reviews were posted while only the first episodes had been released, as they're quite enjoyable, but there's no way a self-respecting viewer can accept this as remotely decent drama after that absolute trainwreck of a finish. Man those last episodes were painful.When the 2nd season of a masterpiece is released so soon after the masterpiece itself it's usually not a good sign, especially when the star-writer is already doing so many things at once (Yellowstone, Tulsa King, Mayor of Kingstown, etc.). One can only have so much inspiration, and it was all used-up long before this season could be wrapped-up.So it has all the fat tricks of a botched sequel made under producers pressure and tight deadlines, and then worse. Fillers, added exoticism and spectacular events to make up for the lack of inspiration, hollow dialogues, soapy, fragmented storylines, corny romance, gratuitously lewd scenes, cartoon villains being pure evil in every possible way, music artificially building tension, cheap & almost explicit political messages (from all sides), etc.They obviously intend to make a 2nd season of it and maybe that's why the story is stretched so thin, but who would want to watch it?","rating":"4\/10","date":"8 March 2023"}

The series also has a generational aspect, which provides an opening for developing a family chronicle. I am not surprised (provided the quality is maintained) that this will be a series winner we can follow for many years.Overall, an environment worth watching is created.

{"title":"I wanted to like these prequels but they're dull","review":"I have been a fan of Yellowstone from the start. As silly as it can get, it is engaging and the storylines good enough to hold your attention over the series.So I was excited to start watching the two prequel series and boy, I wish I hadn't. I lasted about two episodes into 1883 and 1923 before giving up.Why? In short, they're dull. We are expected to care about a whole bunch of new characters - and man, are there a lot of characters - and their various side plots and sub plots. Storylines are slow and unsatisfying and in places the acting poor. Whoever signed off on Jerome Flynn's \"Scottish\" accent should be fired. He's a decent actor but what is that abomination?Even Harrison Ford can't save 1923. Here's yet another Dutton, oh look he's tough, oh look he's having the same problems we know Costner's Dutton will have in 100 years' time.The problem is, I just don't care about any one of these characters. At all. So I can't be bothered waiting 10 hours of TV to find out what happens to them. We know where the family ends up anyway. There was potential here, but it's not been fulfilled. There's too little story, stretched too thinly to \"fill out\" yet another series to try to get signups.","rating":"","date":"7 March 2023"}

So it comes as a very pleasant surprise that I find 1923 very watchable and the plot and dialogue very clear. I enjoy that there are a stories about different characters going on in parallel and in different locations and all of these have an element of early 20th Century history. Some of which seems unbelievable that it happened or was allowed to happen a mere 100 years ago, The scenery in Montana and Africa makes for a stunning backdrop and I adore the ladies' costumes. We have only been treated to 4 episodes so far - can't wait until 3rd February when more episodes drop on Paramount +.

{"title":"Masterpiece","review":"The Show is cleverly written, the characters delightfully three-dimensional. After watching all of 1883, the first few episodes of 1923 were spent subconsciously trying to piece together the Dutton in the family tree, which was pretty fun. You slowly get to know Spencer Dutton, and wonder how he fits. And then he meets Alex. Enter one of the most excitingly depicted romances ever brought to the screen. I've rarely felt like that, like I was in the relationship along with them. The viewer really comes to love their flaws and qualities and you see how beautifully they accentuate each other, different kinds of boldness personified. That exciting feeling of them being perfect for each other somehow suffuses into you, and you feel like you're really taken along on the ride, as if the romance were not just witnessed, but somehow felt. And it's not just Spencer and Alex, the relationship between Harrison Ford and Helen Mirren's characters are equally as brilliant ; a similar kind of love, but more mature. You can feel the wildness in their history, you can sense that they were just like Spencer and Alex once. Each episode has one \"Bang-Pow\" moment where you jump off the couch, kind of freaking out a little bit. It's fantastic writing. Equally as impressive, each episode has at least one beautiful insight that shakes you to your core, whether it be political, poetic, philosophical, or otherwise. All the characters are vulnerable and accessible. The villains are perfect, impeccable, human. More importantly, the action and pacing keeps a very strong tension throughout each episode, and each episode's conclusion is a climax leaving you panting for more . 1883 was the exact same. Taylor Sheridan is an absolute genius. The plot, story, pacing characters, and all of the development are braided together so expertly that while you watch the show, you just feel like the world makes sense, and that makes for a great television! I have absolutely nothing to fault the show... The only flaw I can find is that I'm left wanting more, a lot more! (Season two confirmed - fewf!)","rating":"10\/10","date":"11 March 2023"}
{"title":"1923","review":"Its good... keep me guessing what's going to happen next...the execution of the stories from the first episode it's amazing...the show is full of powerhouse actors pushing upcoming actors to fruition. 1923 is just sending a message to it's audience that life has no mercy, it has not friends or family and it teaches us to expect the unexpected.

{"title":"Great TV!","review":"I can\u00b4t wait for season 2. It felt terrible when it finished because we were looking forward to the next episode each week. I think this is the better TV show out of Yellowstone and 1883. Of course, we will continue to watch Yellowstone or 1883 if they have new seasons or any other spin-off. But the characters in Yellowstone got too exagerated as the seasons progressed. And the poetic voice in off and the storyline in 1883 were not as good as 1923. You notice the great budget for 1923 in the scenes in Africa, the boats, etc. And it\u00b4s so well acted. Really top notch. Can\u00b4t wait for the second season.","rating":"10\/10","date":"12 March 2023"}
{"title":"Bizarre, overly-dramatic,","review":"Very bizarrely-written show. Poor character development, many flat characters with outbursts of cheesy demonstrations which gives the show am immature feel. Many overly-dramatic scenes which lack cohesion in their continuity and feel randomly ordered. Hard to feel any sense of togetherness in the multiple (so far) disparate storylines. A lot of gratuitous violence (though likely accurate).Disappointing lack of progression from the first episode to the season finale. Surprised at the lack of plot development in the final episode. A LOT of filler scenes that feel unnecessary.All together a bit odd, but an okay romp for mindless watching.","rating":"6\/10","date":"8 May 2023"}

{"title":"Fantastic representation of life at the time...","review":"....unfortunately let down by one or two missed castings.Having said that maybe it's just me as others don't seem to see what I'm seeing.Personally find the relationship between Spencer and Alexandra boring. It's all played out, been done before and completely lacking in real chemistry.Speed of their relationship forming doesn't correspond with what's being seen on screen. Unlike 1883, Elsa Dutton fell in love quickly but it was believable each time.Moving past this relationship the series is fantastically gritty and very real. Aminah Nieves wonderfully brings forth the pain, suffering and strength of the Native Americans during this period.Helen Mirren some how brings elegance to her role of a tough ranch owners wife, Harrison Ford equally good as her husband.A far more believable relationship. Jack and Elizabeth showing love can exist in such tough wilderness.Well worth watching as with the other series in the telling of the Dutton family.","rating":"7\/10","date":"20 August 2023"}
{"title":"Too many shows Taylor","review":"Yellowstone great. Tulsa King great. 1883 pretty good, young blonde actress notwithstanding. Mayor of Kingstown (1st season!) great. This one is garbage. Writing, editing, directing all amateur hour compared to others. It would be unwatchable if not for Mirren, Ford, Patrick and Flynn. Dude clearly went for a cash grab and spread himself too thin. The 3 different story lines feel like different shows. They're hastily written and leave the viewer with the sense that producers were scrambling to put 50 minutes of content up on the screen every week no matter how shoddy. There's some gratuitous sex and violence that seems incongruous with the high bar set by Yellowstone as well. C'mon Taylor, you're better than this...like WAY better.","rating":"4\/10","date":"22 February 2023"}
{"title":"Great Show worth watching.","review":"1923I started watching this show because I really like Yellowstone. I wish my family still had all its land, so I could own a beautiful ranch. It would be so much better than being in a city. Hard work, but good honest work and the land is so beautiful. This show is so far a really good show. Now as much as I love the western shows and really want to own 10,000 acres of mountains and valleys and rivers and lakes. The one thing I hate about the time period is the nuns and Catholic\/Christians. The racism, hatred, the I am better than you attitude, etc. The show is very well done and put together. What an amazing time to be alive. When the world was still so very big and so much to see and explore. The world wasn't dying by plastic and man's over 8 billion residents. Oh the best part about back then No Trump or insane people thinking politicians eat babies or Lizard People have taken over the government.I always thought Jesus was for the poor and wanted peace. But the followers have done nothing since their inception in the later years of the end of Rome, but caused death and destruction. Treating these poor people like animals is just disgusting. I am \u00bc Chippewa and the rest Viking and Scottish. My ancestors on both sides have seen its fair share of brutality by the Jesus people. It is so much easier to talk to people and help people. Offer people things like soap and food and medicine. Help those who need it. Instead they think someone who isn't White Christian \/ Catholic is not human. Africans, Eastern Asians, Native Americans, Celtics, Vikings, Hispanics, Pacific Islanders, etc have all felt the wrath and evil that is the church. If you don't conform then you're not human, then you get whipped or hanged.Look at history and see what they have done. For example the plague was caused by Christians saying pagans were witches and what animal is associated with witches? Cats. What's so important about cats? Well they eat mice and mice carry lice which carry diseases like the plague. The Catholic Church invented some of the most ruthless torture ever invented and used it for hundreds and hundreds of years. The Crusades killed millions. The destruction of Africa. The almost complete destruction of the Aztecs. 90% of Native Americans were wiped out. World War 1 and 2. So much death and destruction by this religious group. Just look objectively at history and you will see for over 2,000 years what the root cause has been to almost everything shameful, horrific and so many massacres. I guess this show will show this brutality and that's a good thing. I hate when shows hide what really happened and how things were back then just to make things look happy and nice.","rating":"9\/10","date":"19 December 2022"}
{"title":"Once in a decade","review":"So, every now and then, maybe once a decade, there is a show that catches me, I mean REALLY captures me, like this one did. I liked Yellowstone a lot. My sister put me on it and I was reluctant because she generally likes sappy romances, but I gave it a go and wasn't impressed at first, but became pleasantly surprised. I watched the spinoff 1883 and thought it was pretty good. Not to the same standard but likely because it didn't last as long so I didn't get the opportunity to feel as attached to the characters. Now this gem came along and I was reluctant to go in but did ONLY because....well.... Harrison Ford? Had to give it a whirl. Started a bit slow for the first episode but episode 2, enter Alexandra and damn, I NEVER KNEW I HAD A ROMANTIC BONE IN MY BODY. Loved her interaction with Spencer and my ladyfriend of 26 years caught the smile on my face and tear in the corner of my eye when she ran after his car. She saw it before me so knew how I might react. Reminded me of her and I and our romance in it's troubled beginnings. Almost the same except I wasn't a hunter or a former soldier. Just a reckless loner. I expect a bad ending to their relationship, at least that's how I would write the story to maximize the effect. But my secret heartfelt hopes are that Spencer and Alexandra live beyond season one and are the legacy of the family in the modern age. Hope they live long lives together as I see consistency between my relationship and theirs. They are the reason I love this show as much as I do, but also I give a SUPER HUGE shout out to the acting of not only Harrison Ford, Helen Mirren and Timothy Dalton, but especially to Jerome Flynn....that guy is such an amazing actor, I would love to see him play a detective in his own show. He would make a badass, against the rules Dirty Harry!","rating":"10\/10","date":"19 February 2023"}
{"title":"It did not advance anything in eight episodes","review":"No idea where they are going with 1923, but It's not up there with Yellowstone and 1883. It started off so good, I like the program as part of the Yellowstone series, 1883 was quite an adventure. But 1923 delivery is too slow, and if we add to that that the streaming service half the time does not work efficiently, even with 5G 200Mbps. Of boredom, or because simply not even paying the signal work, I have had to leave chapters in half, to return later. The story did not advance anything in eight episodes, the time spent in Africa with the disloyal fianc\u00e9 either, by the way she is beautiful and I love the character, but now we have to wait until the end of the year. With all this issues I doubt it reaches the level of Yellowstone. Hopefully, the show can be salvaged with relevant story lines added.","rating":"8\/10","date":"4 April 2023"}
{"title":"Not what I expected, but I guess it worked","review":"I just got done watching season one of 1923 and wanted to give my full thoughts on it. So first off, I'll say, the way they captured the time period and setting was done at its best like 1883 was. Secondly, as much as it may hurt to say, I don't feel this show lived up to the expectations that 1883 was able to give us as I felt very frustrated at times with the show itself. 1923 got off to a great start, but once it got around to halfway through the show, it felt off. Another thing I was kind of disappointed about, is the fact that we don't get as much of the main characters as I thought we would, because they spend too much time I feel like exploring the side characters and villains more than the characters that are actually important. Harrison Ford I was excited to see in this show as Jacob Dutton, because it's been awhile since we've gotten work from him, but the problem I had with him is, he gets sidelined nearly halfway through the show and it was disappointing, because he was the character I was looking forward the most to seeing. Helen Mirren was a interesting choice as Cara Dutton and surprisingly, she had some of my favorite scenes and lines from the show. I feel this show wouldn't be what it is without her character. My favorite character out of the whole show I have to say is Brandon Sklenar as Spencer Dutton and I felt his character carried the show throughout its first season as well as setting the tone of the show and what is to come in the future. His character I felt is what this show needs to keep it afloat. His chemistry with Julia Schlaepfer's character Alexander was on point and I hope to see them again together in the future as well. By the end of the first season though, I feel like the show was left unfinished and left me unsatisfied. Overall, 1923 is a worthy addition to the Yellowstone Universe and I will be looking forward to season two despite some of the problems I've had with season one that I hope they adjust in the next season. Rating 8\/10.","rating":"8\/10","date":"1 March 2023"}
{"title":"Never have watched Yellowstone so only watched this for Harrison","review":"Well as I write this review I have never seen a complete episode of \"Yellowstone\".When I heard about this series it made my day that Harrison was going to be in it. He is my favorite actor and I have been following his career for over forty years.Pairing Helen with Harrison again was great casting.Now, for the show itself. The Dutton story was interesting. Show did have a lot of unnecessary character deaths in it.I did not care of the story going in different directions with different characters having nothing to do with the Dutton's.A big complaint on episodes seven and eight. The time wasted on the two \"ladies of the night\". Man was that time wasted and the unnecessary nudity. A put off for me. Two thumbs down.I am glad to see Timothy Dalton here as the main villain. He should have been brought in on an earlier episode.How many bad things & cliff hangers did they leave for season two? After \"Who Shot J. R.?\" first did this over forty years ago this show over did it on these cliff hangers.I will be awaiting season two. But, do hope some of the thing I mention here are fixed.","rating":"8\/10","date":"27 February 2023"}
{"title":"Mostly Good","review":"I watched both 1883 and 1923 back to back and I have to say 1883 was definitely better. I still enjoyed 1923, Harrison ford and Helen mirren are wonderful! The Dutton Ranch story is great! The Teonna storyline is hard to watch but I understand why it was included in the series. The one storyline that seems out of place and I really could do without is the spencer\/Alexandra storyline. I liked it at first but then it just started making me roll me eyes and I even fast forwarded some of their scenes. I get it! They are in love and can't keep their hands off each other... blah blah blah. I much prefer jack and Elizabeth, their conversations are cute without being nauseating. I really wish they would have skipped some of Spencer's journey so he could be back on the ranch by the last episode.","rating":"7\/10","date":"26 August 2023"}
{"title":"Unfortunate casting","review":"Absolutely love the story line and the first episode was great. Unfortunately, if you were looking for the Harrison Ford action star of Raiders, you were sorely disappointed. He remains a great actor however, his age shows ...both in his looks and his actions ,which impacts the character negatively.Helen Mirren does a spectacular job in her role. She is believable a tough, hard scrabble rancher who can do most anything a cowboy can do.The character of Jack Dutton has a great youthful exuberance.The origins of Yellowstone are crafted as amazing storytelling with broad, sweeping landscapes.","rating":"8\/10","date":"19 December 2022"}
{"title":"Good for the most part","review":"Sorry need to just say right out of the gate that people need to keep their politics out of reviews. Who cares if the actors are repubs or dems in their personal.life it's about the acting. The acting was pretty damned good, expecially Helen Miren she is one of the all time best. Supporting casts was good enough. Ok so two needless situations in my opinion. One, the Catholic father beating the nun for beating the student. And two, the Africa story line is completely unnecessary. The black sheep of the family could be in a hundred different locations why Africa? Also not every cowboy was a badass danger seeking bad boy. For the most part I liked it and hope it ends up being as good as 1883.","rating":"7\/10","date":"19 December 2022"}

Did I mention the lusty sex!? DRAMA! WRITING! ISN'T THIS SHOCKING?No, it isn't. It's lazy and aimless. I honestly don't know where this show is going or who it's for.

{"title":"Not a spin-off but a prequel","review":"1923: Season One is not a spin-off but rather a prequel to Yosemite created and written by Taylor Sheridan streaming on Paramount+. The Dutton family legacy is portrayed during the time of the Great Depression and expansion into the Western Frontier during the Prohibition years. Harrison Ford and Helen Mirren act as the next generation to help protect and save the Yosemite valley from naysayers and corrupt government officials. The storyline also follows Mirren's nephew Spencer Dutton (Brandon Sklenar) and his adventures throughout Africa. Besides the Duttons we also learn about the Indian tribes in the area where the kids are forced to attend and learn the Christian way. The series is very graphic with violence and the inhuman ways of life. It's a great slow paced series that includes Robert Patrick as the town Sheriff along with Jerome Flynn as the antagonist, and Timothy Dalton as the multi rich land owner adjacent to the Dutton family ranch. Great actors, good compelling stories, looking forward to the follow up seasons.","rating":"8\/10","date":"13 August 2023"}
{"title":"So much better than Yellowstone, though not as good as 1883","review":"Give us more Alexandra and Spencer, please! That was the best part of this series, by far, even though we didn't know it at the start. With so much gap in storytelling between 1883 and 1923, it's hard to follow along at first with this series, but it gets rolling and successful by the end of the season's 8-episode run. The least interesting storyline is the one in Montana, actually, as the brutal racism of the American frontier is an embarrassment to Christianity and the West as a whole. It's rough to finally see it accurately portrayed, America's second genocide; 1883 mostly avoided exploring the first genocide, of course, to focus on the Dutton move to Montana. This series demonstrates what lawlessness does to everyone, regardless of ethnicity. We can't celebrate that, and maybe that's the hardest part of this series to watch: the Duttons are not \"heroes\" like the Corleones might have been regarded as, as there is little ethical or moral code to their actions (save Spencer, of course). It's hard to root for Jacob here, even though we love rooting for Cara. Isn't that always the way it goes? Behind every allegedly great man, there is a truly great woman. Enough said there ... the casting and writing are pretty awesome, collectively: Helen Mirren is her usual brilliant self, but Julia Schlaepfer and Brandon Sklenar shine together on screen. But Timothy Dalton and Darren Mann do nothing for their characters. It was painful watching any scene with either of those actors. Still, can't wait for the next season-and maybe some filling in of the gaps between 1883 and 1923 would really help? Truly.","rating":"9\/10","date":"18 January 2024"}
{"title":"Excellent","review":"This series is simply amazing! The continuation springboarding from the 1883 series. Every single cast member is believable and I felt as though I was right there with them in every scene. Helen Mirren has long been a favorite of mine and she does not disappoint. Harrison Ford does an outstanding job of portraying his part as well. The rest of the cast compliments each other so well. The many lives and stories expertly intertwined into a masterpiece. 1883 and 1923 will be rewatched often in this house. These prequels to Yellowstone have been carefully thought out. Each detail meticulous in its execution.","rating":"10\/10","date":"27 March 2024"}
{"title":"8,8\/10","review":"I watched the drama movie with interest, I especially loved the director's successful cinematography. As the movie progresses in three different directions, an unexpected ending awaits you at the end. The costumes are exquisite. It reflects the atmosphere of the period perfectly. The actors have already proven their success. They impress again with their understated and exquisite acting. I can't say that I like Western style productions very much. I don't know if there will be a second season, but a lot of things were left unresolved in the finale. This can be interpreted as the second season will come. Whether there will be a second season or not, we watched a nice series of movies even in this state. Thanks to those who contributed.","rating":"8\/10","date":"10 September 2023"}
{"title":"Loving the series but....","review":"I've watched all of Yellowstone, 1883 and now watching 1923, just love these shows! However, the character Alexandra in 1923 is a cross between laughable and annoying! Her British accent is appalling and it would have been better if she were American- I can't see the point to the show with her being British? The scene of her in the tree after the car incident was ridiculous, with her constant shrieking. I get it would be terrifying but it just wasn't believable. I'm enjoying the rest of the characters however and seeing some familiar actors - Harrison Ford; British actors Helen Mirren and particularly Jerome Flynn again, always good value. Can't wait to see what's to come!","rating":"9\/10","date":"12 January 2024"}

Helen Mirren and Harrison Ford are great and their dialogue jyst fizzes with pathos and humour...Jerome Flynn is great but why give home a Scottish accent to deal with , either cast a Scottish actor or make him English .. Don't get me started on Alexandra !!!! You've cast 2 English actors for main roles so why not an English actress for the role of Alex ?? Her accent is like something I've never heard before .

{"title":"How long does it take to cross the Atlantic?","review":"I truly love the 1883 and the storyline that went along with it, it was awesome, but this dragging on in 1923 is boring to be honest, they decide to spend half the season in the crossing that normally takes maybe 2-3 weeksa then. But here, it drags on and on and on, by the time they make it to America I am sure they settled half the country already and nobody remember the Duttons that was suppose to come and rescue them.1883 had a pace to it, it was something \"new\" in most episodes, it did not drag on and on and on about the same thing all the time.This time the creators have stuck on a storyline and probably will rush the ending in the last 2 episodes, he will arrive like the second coming of Christ only to find he is no longer needed.BAH!! Only reason this gets even half the decent stars is the acting, the storyline itself can suck it...to slow and to boring.","rating":"6\/10","date":"26 February 2023"}

I don't look at or think about my phone and need to have no distractions to watch this.There is nothing not to like. Period drama at its absolute best.

I have already written enough about that in another review. 1923 should not more then 4 episodes without the useless shooting of animals, spencer's way too long romantic journey, the sadistic perverse timothy dalton, the pace of the episodes, the church i already know are hypocrites and the disgusting nuns and men with the cross of jesus who also want to say something in the name of god. Useless non-contributory and very annoying way of acting from even some big names. I think it was a mistake to make this serie. Soon we will get a voice over in every new serie.

I didn't read the movie plot, I wanted to be surprised.And I wasn't disappointed.I got sucked into the western and I was shocked, emotional, happy, sad, angry at the same time. It was an emotional roller coaster in every way. The actors were very well chosen, the story was exciting and interesting and most of all intense!I loved how they showed two sides, the ranch in Montana and the journey of the oldest Spencer Dutton and also him falling in love, battling his demons.The music depicted the intensity of the series and made the more emotionally connected to the characters and the happenings.It was one of the best built series I have ever seen, the accuracy was amazing.

I really appreciate having MANY different characters to be a fan of as well as the three distinctly different storylines (Dutton Ranch, Indian School, African Safari) all following their due course until the time we eagerly await their sync up.

You can't change history but in the future to NOT repeat the unpleasant & cruel things that happened to different walks of life that make up all of the world's civilizations. Can't wait to see how the story evolves to bring it all home to the Yellowstone present day!

Every single episode is worth watching over and over again. 1923 brings to life what it was like to live back in those days. When things were changing over from horses, to motor vehicles. And when electricity was something new. The love stories between the characters is very riveting. How is it going to come about? We can't wait to see. Teonna's story is so good as well. Will she survive? Will she find love? We are excited to see how it all comes together. The Africa scenes are edge of my seat! There is so much about this show to like. It's a must see for sure!

People here complain of the Indians being mistreated. If that is correct historically then it is what it is. There was so much going on in out young country at the time. A clash of city development and country range living and culture. Of progress and others living as it was. Now we see both were mostly right. Interesting to see the beginning of engineered items to do the work for you, refrigerator, washing machine, etc. One thing remains to this day. Someone always wants what you have.

{"title":"Tough to do it 3 times","review":"Yellowstone and 1883 are well done, with each having its strengths and weaknesses. 1923 has multiple threads, which requires careful writing. It's fairly well done so far. The Montana story is interesting, with the typically Yellowstone-honoring gorgeous scenery. Alternatively, the Africa thread is distracting so far, and the American woman affecting a horribly bad British accent is a result of unnecessarily bad casting. Plenty of British actors could've done a better job, and with an authentic accent to boot. The show's place among the other Yellowstone stories has yet to be earned.

I thought the first spin-off was great, but it became predictable and had issues I didn't care for, without getting into specifics and spoilers. I just happen to like this one better. The actors in 1923 seem more comfortable in their roles, although I do believe 1883 had some great stars, like the great veteran actor Sam Elliott, along with LaMonica Garrett, Gratiela Brancusi and the impressive Isabel May who were all standout. I can't really give a defining answer as to why, but this series seems to set the stage somewhat better for the future of the Dutton family. And what can't be said about the incredible cast? Harrison Ford, Helen Mirren, Timothy Dalton. All craftsman actors. And the under classman, Brandon Sklenar and Julia Schlaepfer are a feast for the senses in their scenes, they just leave any romantic wanting more. The amazing acting of Aminah Nieves, if she doesn't receive accolades for her performance then no one in her field should be able to call themselves a thespian.1923 is proof there's good talent left in Hollywood with Taylor Sheridan. I started following him with 2017's Wind River, and I knew then he was the shot in the arm Hollywood needed. Not saying he's the second coming of Stanley Kubrick or John Huston but I just wish Hollywood would clean house of all the garbage it's been pushing and replace it with more talent like Mr. Sheridan.","rating":"9\/10","date":"20 February 2023"}
{"title":"Competing Divergent Storylines weakens rather than strengthens series","review":"Of the 3 series: Yellowstone, 1883, 1923; I think this is the weakest. And it's still pretty good don't get me wrong but the Spencer\/Alex segment consistently completely stops the momentum every time it cuts to them...And Alex's affectations & speech manners, I'm not sure exactly how the character of Spencer is swept off his feet by her, but ahh young love, who can explain it?However this whole 1st season is building & leading to a big showdown of some sorts, the Duttons vs the tag team of Tanner the sheep herder & Timothy Dalton's sadomasochist businessman. All's he needs is a handlebar mustache to twirl & he could be a villain from bygone days...\nAnd the season ends with Spencer still across the pond just trying to get back to America. Obviously Mr Sheridan has a long view here but damn, it's a tough pill to swallow & a long way to wait for the \"payoff\". Kudos to Ms Helen Mirren, I think she kills it and the Spencer character is also well done, except he's dragging around the Alex anchor for some godforsaken reason. I don't buy that mad passionate love affair imho.And the cruelty & degradation of the Native Americans, while I presume rooted in truth, is tough to watch but powerful. Though I'm not sure where the intersection of that storyline is going to mesh w\/ the main story but I'm sure Mr Sheridan has it all planned out on a story board I guess.All in all, a decent watch (w\/ lots of holes & eye-rolls) but nowhere near great. 1883 = great.","rating":"6\/10","date":"4 March 2023"}
{"title":"Preachy & Melodramatic","review":"I enjoyed 1883. I didn't enjoy 1923. I found myself rooting for the Bad Sheepherders. The Dutton Family comes off as The Elites who hang folks they don't like, the law be damned. I found myself rooting for Banner Creighton, the Little Guy. There's no predicting precisely where 1923 is headed after this initial eight-episode season, but on the basis of its first season, it's likely not straying far from the path, earnestly espousing down-home values and the supremacy of the rural to the urban. In the most overt articulation of the material's ethos, Cara informs despondent Elizabeth that she'll have to accept that every aspect of her life comes second to cattle (and men), but that in return-as a frontier woman-\"you will be free in a way that most people can barely conceive.\" If only 1923 itself were freer of Sheridan's trademark clich\u00e9s.","rating":"5\/10","date":"1 March 2023"}
{"title":"Best show in a long time (Peak television)","review":"When a prequel surpass even the original, you know that it is that good! As Better Call Saul had already shown. But what 1923 did is that not only surpassing the original, but also the first prequel 1883...The cinematograhy, the writing, the cast.. this is indeed golden time of television!Although I'm a huge fan of original show \"Yellowstone\" and the first prequel \"1883\", I must say 1923 is the master work of Taylor Sheridan. There are a few things that make 1923 is more successful:1) Helen Mirren & Harrison Ford: They are excellent! Real acting lessons on screen..\n2) Spencer & Alex: It honestly the most cinematic thing I have ever seen on TV, besides their chemistry is on another level\n3) 3-story-setup: It's really interesting to watch and wonder how they all will be connectedI don't think two seaons will be enough for this storyline, I hope that we get to watch this masterpiece for more years.","rating":"","date":"12 February 2023"}

{"title":"Nice series highly recommendable to all American Patriots :)","review":"As an American Patriot I like this series very much - providing some valuable historic insights into America.Indeed, this interesting series teaches us some valuable stuff - so that we can attain the know-how to steer the International Community into a New Age of Peace and Prosperity :)However, as highlighted in this show, it should also be noted that Americans have to be careful not to succumb to the religion of gun- and land ownership.Ultimately living in Peace and Harmony with each other should be more important than primitive survival patterns; which regrettably mankind has still not overcome to this very day. This applies to the entire International Community.On that note, I would like to emphasize that Americans should educate themselves about European Culture - such as the finer subtleties and nuances of the English language, Etiquette, non-violent communication and French cooking - especially as it was France, Ireland, Spain and Britain - who laid the foundation of America; philosophically, linguistically as well as practically.Now it is true that America provided some vital assistance to Europe during those two dreadful world wars. However, such action by America is probably not needed anymore - as I'm quite that we will sort out this mess in Europe in a peaceful way :)My buddies in the CIA are super qualified to resolve these political problems, as well as my mates at MI6 - who are really solid, solid fellows. This of course also includes our joint operations with those fine ladies from the \"Direction G\u00e9n\u00e9rale de la S\u00e9curit\u00e9 Ext\u00e9rieure\" (DGSE) - who know a thing or two about upholding Liberty and the Flame of Freedom :)So Americans can rest assured - and learn from us English and French - how to resolve challenges in a peaceful way; as I'm quite sure the Wild West is over and done with :)Acting President of the United States, the UK and Russia, Mark - THE CROWN\/ POTUS.","rating":"10\/10","date":"6 August 2023"}
{"title":"Very engaging, but...","review":"I like this program, it's engaging and oftentimes suspenseful, but my biggest issue is some of the acting. In particular, the chemistry between Brandon Sklenar (Spencer Dutton) and Julia Schaeffer (Alexandria)--there isn't any! He's a terrible actor and she tries to compensate by over-acting. When I watch her mannerisms, she reminds me of a young Katharine Hepburn but without the charm. It's almost painful watching them interact together. I keep hoping Alex will be killed or get a disease or something to get rid of her character. Ugh! Poor Harrison Ford--he is so past his prime, it hurts. Helen Mirren is the real bright light in this show.","rating":"8\/10","date":"31 March 2023"}

I really do feel that Taylor Sheridan is listening to what everyone wants to watch. Captivating, no nonsense or agenda pushing great shows.Hat's off to you Taylor.

I spent the scenes with the dreadful Alex waiting for a) an elephant to trample her b) a shark to eat her or c) to just fall overboard. She's dreadful. End of.The scenery, the storyline especially that of the demise of the Native American girl (truly harrowing) and Sheridans impeccable script make for an exceptional series. It took me 3 - 4 episodes to ease in probably because Yellowstone was riveting from the get go and I wrongly expected the same.Stick with it doubters.","rating":"8\/10","date":"17 February 2023"}
{"title":"Great Stories with great actors","review":"Overall this show is excellent. My only two complaints are that the pacing can sometimes get a bit slow, and all the gratuitous sex and nudity can get tiresome. Call me a prude, but I'd sooner see more of the story with Teonna Rainwater and her family. I find that story arc very compelling.But that's really it. Other than that the show is great. Harrison Ford, Helen Mirren, Jerome Flynn and the rest of the cast are excellent. Jerome Flynn plays a \"bad guy\" exceedingly well. I feel his character is getting in way over his head. He's sold himself to the devil who is played exceptionally well by Timothy Dalton. Granted, he's not thee \"devil\" in the show. But \"generational money\" often breeds such.You can kind of guess the direction that season two will take. The Duttons are really fighting a losing battle, with their ranch and with time itself. It seems the world is evolving around them and they are being left behind.","rating":"9\/10","date":"2 March 2023"}

No one escape unscathed in this epic western, if you can call it that.Especially brutal is the treatment of native Americans by Catholic priests and local cops.

{"title":"What a great time to be alive to see Taylor Sheridan's Works of Art!","review":"What can I say? Well, after 1883 I was ready for something really good, but I didn't know that the results would've have been so good.Acting: top notch. Hellen Mirren and Harrison Ford are a perfect couple. I felt in love with the romance story between Brandon Sklenar and Julia Schlaepfer. For sure, the fact that there are players like Rob Patrick and Timothy Dalton is something you can't miss on screen.Budget: 200M in total is a hell a lot of money but, they're totally worth it.I am addicted to the realism of the creator, who, as he has done in other series he has produced (Mayor of Kingstown, Tulsa King, 1883, Yellowstone), truly succeeds in creating a very strong empathy for the characters and the context. I find that you feel part of something, you personify yourself in the story more and more.I hope a second season will be made, which, as of today, 17\/08\/2023, has been cleared for production.10\/10.","rating":"10\/10","date":"17 August 2023"}
{"title":"Not salvageable by Ford & Mirren","review":"The exceptional portrayals by Harrison Ford and Helen Mirren couldn't completely salvage this epic saga. I seem to be in the minority but there were too many disconnected storylines some of which were loaded with ridiculous circumstances of invented drama that didn't add to the story. I would have been more content if at least one of them was closed.The sociopolitical absurdities of the times do come out strong. US has some embarrassing history that some need to own up to. Forced attendence to \"indian schools\" is an extreme case of denial in US while Canada comes to grips in a long overdue time of retribution. Miscegenation was a new one with some of these laws in States well past 1960.Nudity and sadomasochism with Timothy Dalton seemed completely unnecessary but maybe there was a concern about viewership in the later episodes.Better close some of these plotlines early in season 2 or this could be called a redo of The Killing.","rating":"6\/10","date":"28 February 2023"}

The villains make it easy to root against and for their downfall. Scenery is immaculate and makes you want to vacation if not move to Montana.

We left the series. I thrn watched 1-4 of Yellowstone. I had to push through. Ted a tree playing Beth's we'd seen in British shows. She's excellent. Here they gave her a tiring character to play.. season 5 is iffy as to if I watch it. Having said that to get here, this is much better, than them. Helen mirren is excelkent as well as others.

The only difference is that now Indians get to live autonomously on reservations, not subjected to rules or regulations unlike any other conquered people on this earth. Cry me a river.

{"title":"Not much going on so far.","review":"To make a show great requires a lot of time and commitment, and with Sheridan spread so thin with so many projects, we're seeing the quality start to fade in what he's producing. I hoped that wouldn't be the case with 1923, but I worry it is.I'll walk through my impressions of the first episode, one by one:1) Elsa from 1883 returns with her questionable Southern accent, and offers some vague explanations as to how this series connects to the others.2) You get Jack and Jacob Dutton speaking in that signature \"Duttonesque\" way that mimics Costner's grizzled intonations and mutterings.3) Mirren is good, but not remarkable in any way. Harrison Ford is terribly old, but seems to fill the Dutton shoes adequately. I felt neither character felt like a \"real\" person, just what a couple of tough old Duttons should look and act like. I felt a little more care and attention could have gone into introducing each character, so we get to know them a little better.4) The Catholic school characters could develop into something interesting.5) Africa plot isn't great, maybe unnecessary.6) There's a few ridiculous moments, and as others have pointed out, some plot holes and historical inaccuracies.7) It's going to need to amp up the drama to keep me watching.Neither good nor bad, I'll give it a chance but I'm not seeing the spark or magic that was so evident from the first episode of the original \"Yellowstone\" so long ago.","rating":"7\/10","date":"23 December 2022"}

How many f-bombs in one sentence do you need to tell a story? Not this many. And can they convey how 'bad' the bad guy is without long, drawn out S&M scenes?

Then we cross over to a scene where there is a guy hunting a lion and I'm thinking is this going to be one of those things where Alan Quatermain meets Indiana Jones? What are we doing so far away from Montana and why am I watching the murder of a lion? Then we witness the physical and emotional abuse of a Native American girl and I am cringing at the gratuitous violence. We have Harrison Ford in this spinoff who's performance is only what I can only describe as wooden. He does act well but he lacks that swaggar and humour that made him famous.

{"title":"Yellowstone in the roaring '20s","review":"\"1923\" (S01, 8 eps, 1 hr, Paramount+) is wunderkind Taylor Sheridan's much anticipated sequel to \"1883\" as well as another prequel to the popular \"Yellowstone\" series - all TS creations. \"1923\" had great promise but it's a product of extremes: violence to big game animals, Catholic nun and priest cringe violence to Indian pre-teens and vice-versa, and all fights are just brutal. There's just a lot of brutality that's really over the top. There's also a signif amount of nudity and sex so be ready to FF through those since they're only there for hormonals, don't add to the story\/plot at all. Our protags, played by yester-year superstars Harrison Ford (80) and Helen Mirren (77), aren't well cast in this since they seem too tired and fragile to be believable as their grizzled characters. Former '80s \"James Bond\", Timothy Dalton (77), is much more vital as cruel businessman \"Don Whitfield\". The Dutton family gets into a dire contretemps with rival ranchers and they really need their soldier-son Spencer to join the fight but he takes all of season one to even realize this while he's doing the post-war safari thing in Africa taking up with sassy society blonde, Alexandra. Seriously, by season's end, he still hasn't returned to the Yellowstone ranch, though he's halfway there maybe. This series mainly suffers from a plausibility crisis with me constantly telling the wife while watching \"ah c'mon, that wouldn't have happened in 1923!\" And with all the gunshot injuries and brutal beat downs, most of these characters should've died of infection within days given there were no anti-biotics in that period. The saga is good but Taylor hasn't done his best writing for this production. \"1923\" has been greenlit for a second season but I hope he makes it much more plausible than this one was.","rating":"7\/10","date":"18 March 2023"}
{"title":"Not As Good As You'd Hope and I'm A Fan","review":"First I am a huge fan of Taylor, so far as I am concerned he can do no wrong. Mayor of Kingstown is the best show on TV bar none.Yellowstone was superb then not then great again. On its cinematography alone it can be watched endlessly. Beth is as authentic a character as Walter White was.1883 is flawless. Just flawless.I had high hopes for 1923.But it's flawed and flawed badly. My first question is why is the cinematography so poor when Yellowstone is heart achingly gorgeous?Harrison Ford is just not credible as a murderously tough rancher. Has he ever played a really serious role with deep character? And he cannot ride a horse so it isn't him and it's jarring once you notice. To be fair at his age it's not to be expected. So why cast him?Helen is better but what is it with the accent? I thought she'd been there for a couple of generations? In addition it's also not her sometimes and that's also jarring.Then there is the whole anti British they need to get rescued by an American nonsense for the jungle stuff. Not to mention the Furyesque stupidity of our hero machine gunning and beating hoards of Germans single handed. Taylor! What are you doing?! Its a casting disaster, Brandon Skienar is very pretty but seems to have stepped out of a Marvel film.Jack Huston was fantastic as the psychologically damaged war vet in Boardwalk Empire. They should have had him in the role. After watching Cole Hauser as Rip which must rank as one of the best casting decisions of all time it's just disappointing.1923 feels like it's been messed with by studio execs when it should have been made with the love and authenticity of Yellowstone and 1883.","rating":"4\/10","date":"10 February 2023"}
{"title":"The Adventure and The Drama","review":"Honestly, I can say that this version of Dutton family is different from Yellowstone and 1883.1923 shows more on the turmoil time for the family and the long awaited boy is having too much lucky and unlucky events (not to say that is too dramatically overkill), so I feel a little bit of lame on the story pace, but my problem is that I already fall in love with the Dutton family story, so I keep on going and I hope that in season 2 of 1923 the pace will be more enjoyable rather than problematic adventures.No doubt that every cast plays their characters quite well, but the story needs to be worked out a little better, I have one scene that I really hated so much, is when Hank got shot in the back, it was really showing a recklessness that should not happened that way. Hank should be more cautious and high aware of the situation.But overall, I enjoyed watching this series, but less enjoyable than Yellowstone and 1883.","rating":"7\/10","date":"20 March 2023"}

They attended church and were God fearing. They often were left in charge while men went to war, left for stock shows and or went on long cattle drives. I really am sick of the Tarzan & Jane scenes, stripping scenes, and other made for male eye candy scenes that are thrown in to titillate and keep the story R rated. I'd like for my son to watch it with me without embarrassment and trashing women. Other examples are the nuns treatment of Native students. We get the point of the treatment in some of the government mandated boarding schools of Native children. Sheridan takes it way too far. Sensational of situations like this are not necessary and again make it adult viewing. The graphic violence in Sheridan series are worse than any R rated movies out there. I believe this is unnecessary and keeps Sheridan from the list of some if the greatest story tellers like Spielberg and Eastwood who both get into the essence of the story and the characters that tell their stories.","rating":"6\/10","date":"4 January 2023"}

Why are there jaws-size sharks in the open ocean? Why are there suddenly posses of muderous catholic priests? Why would you see someone you know the second you arrive in a large city like London? It makes you feel stupid for choosing to watch it after a while.Not sure if Sheridan is just drunk on success at this point, but, after 1883 (a purposeful, thoughtful historical fiction), this is beginning to feel more like a tired, wistful political slog at best or a trashy western soap opera at worst.","rating":"3\/10","date":"20 February 2023"}

The way they tried to glorify killing a fully grown elephant and half a pride of lions without a care in the world in episode 3 didn't sit right with me. So far the \"good parts\" of this show are almost non existent.

Spencer's storyline is a solid 8-8.5, Jacob a 6, and Teonna a flat 2. Thoroughly enjoyed Spencer's adventure and looking forward to season two, but was not a fan of Teonna's story. Also far too much unnecessary and repulsive sexual content that could've been done without. We don't need to see everyone have sex and a dude watch hookers whip each other.

It would have you believe that the vast majority of people alive in 1923 are insane, sadistic psychopaths. Too many examples to even list! Waiting for the reveal that the catholics are actually demons wearing skinsuits.To write an entire season of a program with multiple story lines and never come close to tying them together is an insult to the viewer.

Both are excellent and provide the gravitas around which the main arc of the story revolves. Where the show loses its way (and badly in my opinion) is the arc involving Spencer and Alex in Africa. Despite a good start with the storyline, unfortunately Julia Schlaepfer Is hopelessly miscast (her accent is awful) as Alex and she's not helped by some awful writing. It's like watching two different shows at times. One's a brilliant western drama, the other a mills and boon romance which you'll find hard not to fast forward! Overall though it's worth watching.","rating":"6\/10","date":"14 February 2023"}
{"title":"Far too drawn-out and inferior to 1883","review":"I really wanted to love this show, but sadly it let me down nearly on all fronts. The first three episodes are actually pretty great, but after that all storylines hit the brakes hard. Bafflingly little story is told over the rest of the season. The producers clearly wanted a second season, and it shows in how absurdly long scenes and episodes drag out while making no significant headway with either plot or character development. When there finally is action, it's full of predictable tropes and\/or gratuitous violence.There are good characters and great actors here, but the corresponding writing is surprisingly lack-luster. Harrison Ford and Helen Mirren are excellent together but take a back seat in the second half of the season. The other two main characters, Spencer and Alex, are not unenjoyable to watch, but their storyline trudges on endlessly while making no progress. There is also an extremely violent and dark storyline based around a Native American teenager in a re-education school that has no clear tie-in to the rest of the plot at all. You could skip every scene in that storyline and it would not effect the rest of the plot one bit.The season ends with uninspiring cliff hangers. One was mildly interesting (though not exactly typical season final worthy drama - it mostly involves property tax law), and one that was caused by such ridiculous circumstances and stupid, out of character actions by one of the protagonists it had me rolling my eyes and wishing the episode would just end. This show had a promising start but leaves a mountain to be desired. Maybe rewatch 1883 instead.","rating":"6\/10","date":"7 December 2023"}
{"title":"A Great Turd!","review":"This show is an absolute dud. It started off quite well with engaging characters in fairly intense situations but by about episode 5 the bad acting and crummy script made it too tedious to continue watching. 3 major gripes: actors mumbling, almost necessitating subtitles on - villains too evil to be believable - and extremely disappointing performances from 'name' actors. Whoever directed it shows a great lack of taste in showing OTT violence and allowing the cast to overact to cartoonish standards. Who in hell is the great white hunter and what is the relevance of his adventures to the family?The boring love story between him and his English girlfriend would barely qualify as an adequate hallmark adventure. The three stars are for the nice scenery.","rating":"3\/10","date":"17 February 2023"}
{"title":"Casting was very good except for...","review":"This is a great series, with many high quality actors, the story line, the directing, the scripts, and the editing are all first class. Choosing Harrison Ford was THE winning decision for the producers. The locations for the story are very believable, and beautifully filmed. However, the casting director choosing Julia Schlaepfer was a huge mistake. Every other actor in this series is beautifully portrayed. Watching Schlaepfer, I could swear that I'm seeing a spoiled, mouthy 8 year old girl, instead of a grown woman. She was a very poor choice for that role, and is totally unbelievable to portray what should've been a mature, grown woman.","rating":"6\/10","date":"18 July 2023"}
{"title":"Good, not quite as good as 1883","review":"Almost everything about this shows predecessor was perfect. Hard to follow on the heels of that. This does an okay job, but it's clearly plotted for something much, much longer. And the stakes are entirely different. In 8 long episodes, probably 4 episodes of things happen. It has some pretty great moments, but it is spinning its wheels in favour of a very slow burn, which is unfortunate. Setting the bar so high and trying to clear it an entirely different way is not the best foot forward,It's far from bad though. It's the contrast that hurts it. There's still great performances, thankfully. The sometimes? Return of the narrator of 1883 is very welcome too. The new characters seem well situated. It just feels a bit toothless, to me.","rating":"7\/10","date":"11 February 2024"}
{"title":"Could be better - drags on","review":"Great scenery, acting and storyline. It started with a bang...very interesting, captured my interest. I look forward to watching each episode weekly. AND...nice to see that each episode runs for an hour rather than short little episodes of a half hour that most series have. However, I find there is a mismanagement of the time allotted. Almost every scene drags on to the point of boredom. Just want to stand up and scream - get on with the show.Only one other point to make and that is the part of Alexandra. She has to be one of the most annoying characters I have come across in a very long time with her constant long winded babbling that her character is made to do. Along with that is the phony accent...the babbling and the phony accent, well you watch it...see what you think.","rating":"5\/10","date":"12 February 2023"}
{"title":"Mmmm... still on the fence!","review":"Relatively entertaining iteration of TS's tale of the Dutton family. Definitely not as pretentious as the Yellowstone series, which I couldn't even finish. & not as coming of age, as 1883. Harrison Ford & Helen Mirren are excellent. Directing is solid. Writing... yeah, sometimes it feels like storylines are too drawn out. It feels like real time, that it's taking Spencer Dutton the time it's taking him to return to Yellowstone. Like, come on man... get on w\/ it already! Overall, the series is entertaining so far, b\/ I'll reserve my final judgement until the end... b\/c there have been plenty of miniseries that started strong, b\/ had craptacular endings.","rating":"7\/10","date":"4 March 2023"}
{"title":"Watch worthy !","review":"I loved Yellowstone, but did not enjoy \"1883\". This one has great storyline (unlike 1883). The characters are interesting and have several layers. The plot is strong and the script is well thought through. The story is intriguing and this show has kind of two parallel storylines but both equally good and they made sense to the viewer. Much like yellowstone the good and the bad are very clear but like in any good story the \"good\" have some \"bad\".The story moves forward in a satisfying pace since both the parallel storylines are equally intriguing.I generally enjoy shows that take place in the 1920's and one of the storylines gives plenty of 1920's fashion.","rating":"7\/10","date":"17 March 2024"}
{"title":"Bad acting and bad writing","review":"The entire plot line with the Dutton in Africa is a big bust. Sheridan wanted to try his hand at \"other\" epochs, and he failed miserably. The entire show lacks continuity. Actors using generic \"southern accents\" that lack authenticity is rampant. Ford doesn't bother at all. Modem goes with an Irish accent. Hair and makeup doesn't make any efforts to be authentic. Modern haircuts, Botox, and foundation often distract me from thinking it's a \"Western.\" These inconsistencies don't affect Yellowstone, but a historical piece needs to be devoid of Hollywood glitter when at all possible. Overall the show is a huge budget yielding nothing of value.","rating":"1\/10","date":"12 April 2023"}
{"title":"Mixed.. at times enjoyable","review":"At times enjoyable, Harrison Ford and Helen Mirren good as always. Brandon Skenlor also stands out. Scenery fabulous whether Montana, Africa or Mediterranean.Was really looking forward at the start of the show to look at a different generation of Duttons in the Yellowstone and the challenges to their existence at start of 20th century.Stories ok. Probably true to the time as the further expansion into the west, hard winters and the Great Depression collide. Period detail great. The government schools for native peoples and some of the treatment by clergy and education officials are stories that need telling. Show overall is mix of western, family drama, caricature and soap.Characters stereotypes. Acting mixed. Some accents horrible, particularly Jerome Flynn trying (so bad is unwatchable) to do Scottish and Julia Schlaepfer failing at upper class English..By the end of season Im not really no bothered about the characters or what happened to them.","rating":"6\/10","date":"4 March 2023"}
{"title":"A worthy sequel to 1883? Not quite...","review":"1923 lacks the lyricism that made 1883 so compelling and immersive - in 1883 that was a lyricism of storytelling, sight, and sound - and actors who grasped how not to overplay their hand.1923 is a harsher product, and for me it's not helped by the leads Ford and Mirren, they don't disappear enough as actors for my liking - but I'm sure some will probably find this comment to be a nitpick.In lots of ways 1923 is a fine drama and a good sequel to 1883 - and at least we still have Isabel May's lilting narration as Elsa Dutton - albeit from the grave (although we could probably do with more of it as it helps lend a dreamy quality to the series).That being said, 1923 definitely lacks something that 1883 had in spades - 1883 drew you into the story and made you care about its characters and their outcomes - for me, 1923 doesn't accomplish this, nor do I particularly like what the Dutton's have become - they're selfish and don't play well with others.The series is, however, well aided by the relief from the western front that we get in the pursuit of Spencer Dutton and his new (and playful) wife Alexandra's story and journey.The production design and cinematography are, consistent with 1883, top notch - as is the work by the ensemble - but I don't really like these people whose story we are viewing - it's hard to be sympathetic to arrogance..","rating":"7\/10","date":"24 February 2023"}
{"title":"It's a drag","review":"I would love to give this a higher rating because it started off so good, but halfway through it came to a slow crawl. They need to speed it up. Do a time jump like they did on House of Dragons. I feel like we're gonna spend the whole 3 months traveling with Spencer on that boat. There are two episodes left and I know they are gonna drag this on and Spencer will show up at the Yellowstone at the end of episode 8 \u00f0\u0178\u02dc\u00ab\u00f0\u0178\u02dc\u00ab. Unfortunately that means that they will drag it on with a bunch of griddy take over politics, new electrical appliances, snail mail and cruelty & punishment from those unholy priest and nuns and that's not what I was envisioning with this series.There's a season 2 and that's where the action will pickup, but I really wish they would have done this like 1883 and just told the whole story in one 10 episode mini series. I find myself fast forwarding through most of it because it's so boring in long and drawn out. Absolutely zero excitement. Maybe there's something else coming that we don't know about. Looks like we got another heavy hitter with Captain Shipley (Benjen from Game of Thrones). Hopefully they don't use that talent just to get them across the water or heaven forbid have anymore incidents while traveling on the water. We haven't seen any pirates yet. I really don't care about Spencer and his annoying wife's travels, they just need to hurry up and get him to Yellowstone before anybody else gets unalived.Maybe they're dragging this on until we get to the next episode of Yellowstone or until 6666 starts.","rating":"5\/10","date":"13 February 2023"}
{"title":"Good and interesting","review":"You know what you're going to get from Taylor Sheridan: gratuitous violence, gratuitous sex, and a gratuitous sprinkling of the \"f\" word. Just be prepared. With that out of the way, I like the new slew of Dutton family characters - but there should have been a clearer picture presented of who begat whom - I need a \"who's your daddy\" family tree or flowchart. The one thing to me that is a major, major negative is the Elsa voice over. When I heard it again, I at first thought it was Helen Mirren's character. Second time I heard it-- oh crap, not dead Elsa again. NO MORE ELSA VOICEOVERS.It is definitely interesting enough to stick with, want to see what Spencer does when he returns to the ranch.","rating":"7\/10","date":"23 January 2023"}
{"title":"Started Out Great...","review":"It slows down starting with episode five. It really cracks me up that they had a mid-season finale for episode four and the season only has eight episodes. In fact, Paramount is silly crazy doing that with Yellowstone so much I lost interest in that show.The first four episodes were moving right along and then BAM! They make you wait a month. They have just aired episodes 5\/6 and it really seems like they're dragging it out until the actual season finale. For those who have watched it so far can probably already tell you what will happen in the season finale which is just a repeat of episode four.They will make us wait until season 2 for what we were expecting in episode five. Sorry for being so vague, just avoiding spoilers and making sure I meet my character quota.Some reviewers are saying there's just bad acting and it's totally boring. I disagree. It's definitely worth watching. Despite my complaints, I still give it a 7 and will even upgrade it if they defy my expectations.","rating":"7\/10","date":"14 February 2023"}
{"title":"So disappointed!!! Kinky sex scenes ruined the show...","review":"This series has scenes of totally unnecessary sexual violence and demeaning characterizations of women. I WAS so looking forward to this show. They had to ruin it with kinky sex scenes; particularly in episodes 7 & 8. I had to shut it off. They should have called it \"50 Shades of Yellowstone\".The good Harrison Ford and Helen Mirren scenes can't make up for the raunchy sex scenes. If you enjoy watching women whipping each other, senseless threesomes, and lingering zoom shots of Julia Schlaepfer in super flimsy clothing, this series is for you. This show is clearly designed for a macho male audience,I've never written a movie review before, but I wanted a way to send a message that this show sunk the Yellowstone trilogy.","rating":"1\/10","date":"26 February 2023"}
{"title":"Too slow and too much waiting","review":"Loved 1883, and really enjoyed Yellowstone, at least the first two seasons. 1923 unfortunately lacks enough story to cover the eight episodes so far.The main drive of the story is centered around the return of Spencer. Spencer is in Africa, for some reason. He is an interesting and complicated character. So is Banner, but the rest; not so much.Harrison Ford, gritted and worn, mumbles long monologues about the land. His wife, Helen Mirren kneels outside the house in agony almost every episode, and much time is dedicated to these moments. She also writes letters, and that takes some time too.All the while Spencer is on, or about to be on, his way back. He is repeatedly delayed: No ship is due, his alternative vessel, a smaller boat sinks. He is then finally thrown off the next ship, and the first part ends.What is the point of keeping us all waiting?If it continues at this pace, we can hardly expect him to arrive during the next eight episodes either...","rating":"6\/10","date":"21 March 2023"}
{"title":"Too much soap opera and historical lies","review":"Overall it's a good show, most of the cast is great, well directed, great photography, generous locations, and so forth. My main problem with this series is that romances are so corny, and it spends too much time in Jack and Elizabeth's love story which I don't care at all. Spencer and Alex story is more interesting, but the last scene on the small boat it ruined it all, so corny and off Spencer character.The other problems I found have to do with inaccurate historical events or lies. But we all know what culture dominates Hollywood and that they don't waste any opportunity to throw the catholic church under the bus with all kind of lies (and I'm not a catholic). Catholic church had nothing to do with indian \"education\" in the 20th century, let alone in Montana.Spanish catholic church had a great influence in the former mexicans territories (in the South) up to the early 19th century. Moreover, one priest says he was in Argentina a few years back doing the same, but Argentina got rid of the Spaniards and became an independent country in 1816, and it didn't actually have the \"indian problem\" while it was a Spanish colony. This \"problem\" arose during the expansion to the South in late 19th century and was \"resolved\" by the militaries during the so called \"Desert Campaigns\". The remaining native population was never \"civilized\" by the catholic church.","rating":"6\/10","date":"22 March 2023"}
{"title":"Like the stock market 6 years later","review":"Crash and burn. What a terrible slip, fall, tumble and implosion. At it's best (end of episode 2) I was very curious about the era and how the show might help viewers understand what it felt like to live then \/ there (post Ind Rev \/ wild west, etc). I was also interested in the characters; in fact, mesmerized by the chemistry of Alex and the Dutton guy. The show had great promise; and then, like the Russian hockey team in 1980 and the Patriots in 2008 all that promise gone. Alex and what's his name became an awful caricature of themselves and their journey boring and ludicrous. The.story about the Native girl, whatever importance this might have in the future, I think the writers are definitely doing her an injustice by telling the story the way they are. Other increasingly boring facets are the evil, pathological rich white guy, the evil religious white guys, the evil rancher white guys, the evil Irish sheep guy... Crash and burn if you ask me, I couldn't care less what happens.","rating":"2\/10","date":"27 February 2023"}
{"title":"Good Except ...","review":"We were enjoying this show - multiple interesting story lines, solid writing, and excellent actor portrayals in both of the prequels. The violence included in the boarding school storyline is graphic and distributing, and yet historical in context. Perhaps the intense nature of the storyline is to add weight and importance to this oft-overlooked part of history.The last couple episodes have had some additional elements that seem to be twisted and unnecessary. The wealthy mining representative starts abusing two prostitutes. Viewers understand he is a devious and dangerous man without having to include this.","rating":"6\/10","date":"1 March 2023"}
{"title":"Feeling a little grumpy....","review":"Unlike most of the other commentators, I'm pretty disappointed in a couple castings. With the possible exception of Maggie Smith, Helen Mirren is THE premier British actress. Given her history of roles, I'm having a heck of a time seeing her in a Depression era Western. I'm trying to adapt. And Harrison Ford feels like he's trying too hard to fit the role. Where's Robert Duvall when you need him? All that said, it's got some interesting story lines and look forward to seeing how it evolves. In my opinion, it'll take a lot to surpass \"1883\".... PS Although \"Yellowstone\" has become more or less predictable, I couldn't love it more-if only for the scenery. Glad it's such a big part of the story.","rating":"7\/10","date":"3 January 2023"}
{"title":"Don't waste your time","review":"This show takes excellent actors and puts them in a show that is full of excruciatingly slow scenes and glacial plot development, alternating with scenes that dwell on violence against women to an extremely uncomfortable and unnecessary degree. We really don't need to see Timothy Dalton making the prostitutes beat each other and beating them himself more than once to know he is a really evil person. This show is all broad brush strokes and no subtlety.I tried to watch for Helen Mirren and Harrison Ford, but I can't even watch for them. Pretty scenery will not make up for poor writing and plotting. This show is a hard pass for me.","rating":"2\/10","date":"26 February 2023"}
{"title":"Taylor Sheridan or Mills and Boon?","review":"Sadly, 1923 is a bit of a hot mess. The Montana segments, both with the Duttons and at the Religious school are both excellent, but the African arc is turgid, far too long and straight out of a bad Mills and Boon story. The character of Alex is awful, has a terrible accent and generally spoils most scenes she is in. Sklenar isn't much better, mumbling through his dialogue when he is actually required to say something rather than just take his shirt off.There's just so much of this romance too. No sooner has one scene ended, than we get another basically the same and this goes on for half the season. It might be bearable if the dialogue was decent. By the season finale we've descended into parody with a ludicrous Titanic like setup and a duel to the death on a ship's deck. It's like watching a completely seperate series. Terrible.Harrison Ford and Helen Mirren are superb of course, great to see them back together on screen, but they get precious little within the narrative. The two characters set up to be the most annoying, Jack and his young wife, are two of the best and most interesting characters but they get suffocated out of the story by Spencer and Alex's dull romance.Personally I think it was a great shame to kill off James Badge Dale's character so early. As our only link to 1883 he was someone I was really interested in seeing more of in the story.Timothy Dalton and Jerome Flynn show good promise as the antagonists but have so far been set up very one dimensionally. Having already witnessed Dalton being a voyeuristic sadist in an episode, I'm not really sure we needed it again in the next just to drive home the fact he is amoral and totally evil. Teonna's arc also suffers here with her segements feeling too isolated in the main story, where they should be leading it.There's a lot of promise here, but unlike the slick and elegant execution of 1883's through line this has slowed down consistently, and it was obvious from the moment that a second season was announced that this season would be a meandering setup for what's to come. Ok so far, but a long way to go before it gets close to rivalling 1883. Less travelling romance and a lot more of the range war would be a great start!","rating":"7\/10","date":"28 February 2023"}
{"title":"Please leave out porn","review":"I absolutely positively loved this series. Very good with one huge exception, there's no reason to put fully naked women in the series and multiple times for more than a flash. In fact, it was blatantly out there for a good amount of time, and the things they were doing really really strongly leans towards a porn section in the series. Please leave this out the storyline is excellent without it.!! If it's in the next series, I will not be watching it. The storyline is extremely intriguing. I loved it but I'm hugely disappointing that they had to put this in the series. Stop the porn please please !!!

{"title":"Squandered potential","review":"The 1923 story held great promise and I was looking forward to it. Unfortunately I find the writing is bad, the storyline doesn't move at all, the dialogue is often soap opera caliber, and the music is horrible, unrelenting and at odds with the story most of the time.Eight episodes in and Spencer still has not made it home. (Ulysses had an easier time of it). How many times do we need to be told\/shown that Alex loves Spencer? (we got it after the 7th or 8th time we were told). How many more obstacles can be thrown at Jacob? How many times must we watch gratuitous violence to get the idea that Whitfield is a bad man? (we get it already, he's not a nice guy, move on).On the upside - Helen Mirren is extraordinary and perfectly cast. She makes the show watchable all by herself.","rating":"3\/10","date":"27 February 2023"}

Big fan of western dramas and Taylor Sheridan series in general. Unfortunately the actor\\actress who plays the head nun has the worst Irish accent I've ever heard, its excruciatingly bad !I can't figure it out is she from the north or the south. Truly awful!For a big budget production with major stars Helen Mirren and Harrison Ford is a bit embarrassing.

{"title":"I was looking forward to watching1923, but...","review":"Generally, I do not write reviews on here unless I have given something at least an 8 rating. But because of the contrast, at least for me, from the exquisite 1883, I thought I would share this.I was so excited to watch the continuing saga of the Dutton family.But 1923 had a different feel to it compared to 1883 or Yellowstone.I am actually kinda of bored with it, (I admit I am on episode 4).And the violence afflicted upon innocent children is just too much for me. I have been skipping over the parts where the so called \"people of God\" find it necessary to beat someone's heritage out of them.I think it would be better if the graphic-ness of these scenes were edited out. Men beating the crap out of each other, I can handle, but the abuse of innocence, is where I draw the line, especially since I knew this is how Native American children were treated at one time.Cruel Wasichu.","rating":"6\/10","date":"18 January 2023"}
{"title":"Trope filled romance novel","review":"1883 started out well and then lost its way. 1923 amplifies all the glaring weaknesses of 1883, starting off poorly and deteriorating into a slush filled bore-fest.About halfway through the second episode, during one of the Spencer story-line romantic scenes my wife turned to me and said \"It's a freakin' bodice ripper!\"The music drones and then swells. The baddies are nihilistically cartoonish.The story is unfocussed: Is it about a range war between cattlemen and sheepherders? Is it about the atrocities in forced assimilation schools? Is it about the endless roadblocks to the damaged but supernaturally competent Spencer's return to Montana, or is it all just narrative blah blah to link scenes of declarative romance?By the last episode, I really didn't care.","rating":"3\/10","date":"26 February 2023"}
{"title":"It's just kind of... meh.","review":"Although I enjoy the show, it doesn't hold a candle to 1883. That show was a ten. This one is also taking a break for over a month after just four episodes? What in the hell is that about? Just when the story would get interesting with Spencer heading home to help save the ranch from the inbred sheepherders, there's a break. For absolutely no reason whatsoever. I also find the relationship between Alex and Spencer happened a little too quickly. I just don't really like this show as much as any of the other Taylor Sheridan shows. And I think a lot of that has come from the casting, and also the character development issues, especially for Alex and also the sheepherder. The original Yellowstone show has also started to get pretty boring. 1923 is better than that show in my opinion.","rating":"7\/10","date":"22 January 2023"}
{"title":"Let down by one storyline","review":"Six episodes in and I am starting to wane. The story about the ranch is ok, (despite Helen Mirrens accent) the young American Indian girl is fascinating if a bit gruesome but by far and away the worst part of this show is the Spencer storyline.He is supposed to be a master hunter but his first job we see him trying to hunt a leopard, he watches a woman get taken by the leopard and only then decides to shoot it. He only seems to be able to shoot animals from point blank range with his shot gun so the idea of him being a master hunter is laughable. And as for the girl he meets, Alex, she has to be one of the most annoying characters on tv. Her fawning over Spencer is nauseating and the dialogue between them is even worse.","rating":"6\/10","date":"8 March 2023"}
{"title":"God awful!!!","review":"Yellowstone is entertaining, though at times it can become draggy and boring, and I was really looking forward to the backstory prequels. After a terrific 1883, I expected the same quality from the 1923 prequel, but I feel totally let down and abused by this garbage.Brutality for brutality's sake, senseless, mind-numbing banality, ridiculous dialogue and comic book characterizations . . .what a HUGE disappointment! Can't believe I Iasted 7 episodes . . .total waste of time and brain cells. Surprisingly, given the cast, the acting is wooden and uninspired. The plots are straight out of any pulp fiction bodice-ripper, truly laughable, cringe-worthy, and predictable.","rating":"1\/10","date":"19 February 2023"}
{"title":"Entertaining, soapy prequel but too gory","review":"I found \"1923\" entertaining, mainly for the tense battles between the ranch-owner Duttons and their various dastardly adversaries, which is basically the same conflict we see playing out in the modern-day \"Yellowstone.\" Helen Mirren shines as expected in her role as the Irish immigrant Dutton matriarch who is devoted to her family.Both of the nephew characters are very appealing and drop-jaw handsome. Quiet, loyal Jack and beautiful Elizabeth make an appealing couple, and their storyline was moving and much more believable than the wacky adventures of Spencer and Alexandra.The Spencer\/Alex storyline was so far over the top that it seemed like a silent movie-era adventure serial; maybe that was intended. It was a fun romp that should have wrapped with their shipboard wedding scene (with Joseph Mawle, Benjen Stark himself, officiating), safely crossing the Atlantic and making it to Montana-a season-closing scene of the Duttons reuniting at the ranch would have been moving drama. Instead, the writers cooked up the ridiculous duel with Alexandra's royal ex-boyfriend on the ocean liner. Very silly. Still, I found myself rooting for these two crazy kids.All the Montana storylines were full of action and drama. Perhaps unrelentingly grim. The story starkly illustrates the overwhelming difficulties of life in ranching in this time period, as well as the systemic persecution of native Americans and anti-Asian racism. I think the writers could have made a greater impact with these messages without the depictions of extreme sadism and gore. (All of the Dutton sagas seem to have cartoonish levels of gore, sadism and violence. Every character has Navy SEAL-level fighting skills and an arsenal of weapons.) The devious businessman out to swindle the Duttons out of their beloved land is a bizarre sexual sadist, too? Every Irish Catholic priest is a sadistic murderer as well as a military-trained gunfighter able to track natives for miles in the wilderness? A teenage girl being abused suddenly turns into an MCU-type superhero fighter? Hard to believe, and I think realism would be more compelling.","rating":"6\/10","date":"1 September 2023"}
{"title":"I quite like this hokum","review":"It looks like a Wilbur Smith novel but I do like it.Surely hanging several sheep herders and then being shot by a mob, one wielding a Thompson machine Gun would get to the ears of the authorities?Jerome Flynns Scottish accent is absolutely awful, as are many of the other actors attempt at a Scots and Irish brogue. Much as I like Mr Flynn, they could have got a Scottish actor to play the part. Or hire a new Voice Coach.I love the Tugboat with its Rope strop auto pilot system, why did we spend millions to Sperry for the Electronic system when a piece of rope would do the job?And sail it at night with all lights in the wheelhouse and on deck blazing away. You would not be able to see out at all to avoid other ships etc.And the lovely ships voice radio with perfect reception akin to 21st century VHF in 1923 when White Star Liners at the time had to tap messages out in Morse Code.But heyho its a story I guess.Entertaining.","rating":"6\/10","date":"15 February 2024"}
{"title":"This is crap","review":"In a rush for money Sheridan and Paramount et. Al. Pooped this series out. It is nothing more than caricatures built to suit cherry-picked historical events. They should be ashamed of this crap.There's no real story crafting or development here. We couldn't finish watching the 2nd episode it was that bad. It's a McDonald's cheeseburger called \"filet mignon\" and served to a naive and gullible audience.Good:The acting is fine, simple fare for Ford and Mirren. The supporting cast does fine as well.The panorama scenes are great.The recreation of the eras sets were detailed.The bad:The African scene of man vs. Leopards confrontation scenes are stupid and fantasy, built only to present the caricature of the great hunter vs powerful animal. Why wouldn't the Englishman not tell Spencer that he suspected there were two leopards? Also, leopards are easily spooked and the second leopard would have run at the sound of the first shot. Let alone after being stabbed by Spencer and shot at a 2nd time. This is a BS story and with just a little effort and creativity put into story development and crafting the same effect could have been achieved.Also Spencer's statement, \"once they get a taste for man, man is the only one they eat\" is asinine. Leopard tastes man it will still eat other game; it is not driven to eat only humans.It's bizarre listening to Elsa's voice narrate the events since she's long dead. It's got that \"chick flick\" style that was overused in 1883. It gets tiring listening to her narration in that southern accent.And my goodness, why couldn't they have gotten a real Irish actress to play the lead instead of Mirren. She's a great actress but why be bothered with her fake Irish accent?The Catholics were all just malevolent caricatures. The head Priest saying, \"I am compassionate but I am not merciful!\" LOL. The abusive Priest could have been made to be abusive without him making such inane statements.Harrison Ford isn't challenged to really act. He could be playing Indiana Jones and it would be the same acting style.Hollywood puts out a lot of crap nowadays and people are easily entertained. I prefer to see some actual work put into the story. We won't bother watching the rest because it isn't worth our time.","rating":"3\/10","date":"28 January 2023"}
{"title":"And","review":"Because of Spencer and Alexandria's story! I've only ever cried once before about a love a couple shared! I also like Teonnas story as well but they only showed that story line periodically. I don't like Yellowstone! I've tried it umpteen times and always have to turn it off! That said I liked this but for the story lines I mentioned. I love Jerome flynn! He was excellent in Ripper street and Got but I didn't like his character here or the fake Scottish accent. I've not much patience but I do like slow burners but this at the start was kind of all over the place not knowing what it wanted to be( maybe due to all the separate story lines but in the end I hope they make a second season because I want to know what happens with Alexandria and Spencer!","rating":"7\/10","date":"28 May 2023"}
{"title":"Good show, but a bit disappointing","review":"I absolutely loved \"1883\". I could not stop watching it. It was mesmerizing. It is one of the best shows I've ever seen. The writing was superb, the cast sensational (Sam Elliott!), the acting laudable, with rich characters, a compelling storyline, and top-notch production. And Elsa! My goodness, she is the BEST female character I've ever seen in a tv show! What a fantastic portrait of a woman! Such a breath of fresh air on the screen! The portrayal of Native Americans is also some of the best I've seen. This series was epic on so many levels and I can't say enough good things about it.However, \"1923\" was a bit of a let-down.First, the transition from the first series was almost non-existent. Yes, Elsa narrated a bit on a few episodes (her accent was noticeably different, though), but there was little explanation of what became of the Duttons. After this intense, magnetic, emotional saga of the family's journey, I expected to find out what happened next. But there was almost nothing. They arrived. They died. End of story. Oh, John survived. But he was a minor figure in \"1923\". I had to rewind to even figure out who he was. Then he was killed off. And suddenly there's this cattle empire run by James' brother, who was never even mentioned in the first series. And a third child? Maybe I'm dense, but I didn't realize Spencer was that child. Again, I had to rewind and try to figure out who these people were. In fact, I googled the Dutton family tree to understand who all the characters were. Apparently I'm not the only one, because there were several sites with the Dutton family tree, so obviously others had to try to figure it out, too. It was all just a bit confusing. There was a real disconnect between the two series. The original Duttons were just swept aside. It felt like \"1923\" was a totally different show. The only connection was the Dutton family name.Second, there was an obscene amount of violence. And lots of gratuitous sex. I'm not against sex, or some violence. But it just seemed that the writers were trying to cram as much blood and nudity in as they could. It wasn't necessary. The beatings of Teonna became unbearable to watch. I understand that it was realistic and that First Nations people were treated horrendously, but this show is not a documentary, it is dramatic entertainment, and seeing her continual beatings made me feel sick and sad (and how exactly did she survive all that? Especially with no concussion, brain damage, broken bones, etc?). And what was that business with Whitfield and the sadism? That was really off-putting and totally unnecessary. It was obvious what a cold, ruthless (psychopathic?) character he was without those scenes. Production wasted a lot of screen time with all this sex and violence, when they could have developed the family characters more and blended the backstory in better.Finally, the show just stopped. There was no satisfying ending. The story didn't wrap up. It just stopped. Did Alexandra make it to America? And who was Teonna? Her connection to the Duttons was never explained. She was a completely separate storyline that made no sense. Was she related to Sam? Did she go on to marry a Dutton? What is her place in this story? I searched for more episodes. I thought maybe Paramount just didn't broadcast all of them, but no, that was the end. It made no sense. I looked on IMDB and it seems there will be a second season. I am waiting for that before I watch \"Yellowstone\". I haven't actually seen that yet. Maybe that's why some of my questions are unanswered. I really hope it's better than \"1923\" and as good as \"1883\".","rating":"7\/10","date":"18 October 2023"}
{"title":"Overly cliched and just flat","review":"I don't get the overhype of this show and can't explain the high ratings here other than that most of the people will \"eat\" anything regardless of quality as long as it's hyped.It's like Sheridan got tired or brainfogged after 1883 which was superb by the way. This one is just a collection of cliches. While I was more than willing to give more chances to Ford-Mirren story even though it was putting me to sleep from the get go, the Africa story just killed it for me completely. I stopped watching around episode 2-3, it's just so banal and uninspired all through and through: from the Spencer character, who is an uninspired cliche, to his love interest\/ love story which both are uninspired cliches, to his \"adventures\" which are, you get it, uninspired cliches. And I love adventure genre, but like well made ones that keep you on your toes.This is an utter dull disappointment. So far it's a first real dud from Sheridan for me. Sometimes I wonder if the script was secretly written through the generative AI, because the whole thing feels regurgitated.","rating":"5\/10","date":"1 July 2023"}

Things just keep going further and further in this show as well as Yellowstone. It just doesn't need to go to the places it goes. The story lines are so good and Taylor makes us care about the characters that we are supposed to care about, but it would be really great if the females could keep their clothes on. I mean what is the point of most of this female nudity other than exploitation? It would be so great if he would cut that out.My favorite of all of the Yellowstone saga was the one set in the 1800's.","rating":"6\/10","date":"14 March 2023"}
{"title":"I remember this as a movie title \"Legends of the Fall.\"","review":"I'm a sucker for anything western and Taylor Sheridan is very prolific in this genre with good stuff to his name, but after episode one it seems this is a re-telling of Legends of the Fall-which was a horribly sad movie.Let's see:\n1. Large, well established (and by all account rich) rancher? Check.2. Young, fun-loving son with a sexy young fiance' that just doesn't get the ranching lifestyle. Check.3. WWI vet with PTSD that travels to Africa to hunt big game. Check.4. White establishment degrading native Americans way of life. Check.If the older brother comes home from Africa and the young fiance fall sin love with him and the brothers end up in a feud, Im done watching. Until then I'll keep watching because it's a western and for the first time in a 40 year career Harrison Ford is actually not playing himself.","rating":"6\/10","date":"29 December 2022"}
{"title":"Old Garbage That's Difficult To Watch","review":"The third series starts off well. All the things you like from Yellowstone and 1883 are there. Big country, horse work, survival through the struggle, it sucks you in quickly and then takes a turn and just sucks. What ruined 1923 for me was the unrealistic people surviving after being shot like 6 times. The unrealistic relationship between Spencer and Alex drags way too long. The manufacturered drama seems so science fiction rather than historical. Timothy Dalton's character is just nasty. Fighting for the Yellowstone seems like a background that is mainly forgotten because the writers are too busy with their heads stuck in fantasy land. Understandably, just like 1883 and Yellowstone there are some difficult things to see, but at least those series make it part of the story instead of hot garbage.","rating":"2\/10","date":"27 February 2023"}

It seemed a lot like work.I'm not in love with the scenes in Africa. I hope the plot brings this storyline into the fold soon. It's beautiful but distracting.A couple huuuuge complicated issues are nodded at. Colonialism in the African continent and continued persecution of Native Americans are such complex topics. I'm glad these issues are mentioned but episodic television is limited in how much exploration can be done. But I'm glad to see Sheridan at least trying to get the word out about the existence of the forced boarding schools. Check out Three Pines in Canada for a more thoughtful treatment of the issue.","rating":"7\/10","date":"2 January 2023"}

By episode 8 it is just wierd filler in order to fill up the episode. Characters are way over the top. Lots of T&A in order to keep some viewers.I understand that Yellowstone is very popular, and the desire to prifit off that. But do it with a little class for God's sake!I also don't like the portrayal of every ethnic group being savagely beaten. Let's face it, bad stuff happened back then. But does every person of color need to be persecuted just to get viewers??","rating":"3\/10","date":"3 March 2023"}
{"title":"It's like that hit movie everybody likes","review":"I 100% agree with Sunraider. Despite three all star actors this is the first Taylor Sheridan show that I don't organically connect with. The boarding school is too disturbing for me. 1883 and Yellowstone have their share of annoying characters but the storyline draws you in. Monica is like Skyler from Breaking Bad but not as bad as GOT's Joffrey Baratheon. Her bereavement is gracing her character with a higher tolerance level for now. I DNF the first episode of White Lotus either. I guess the second season is better? I'll leave this alone and keep enjoying Tulsa King. It was love at first sight.","rating":"","date":"2 January 2023"}
{"title":"Just make it the Spencer Dutton show and I'm good","review":"I have high hopes and excitement getting started into this show. With big names like Harrison Ford and Helen Mirren, I expect something far superior than both \"Yellowstone\" and \"1883\" offerings. \"1923\" is still a well-made, decent show, but is utterly disappointing and does not live up to the high standards and expectations. For one thing, I find Harrison Ford surprisingly rather bland in this. Helen Mirren has her moments but her character is not that exciting either. None of the supporting characters are compelling - we have the boring young Jack Dutton and his one-dimensional wife; the forgettable cast of sidekick cowboys; and the laughable thief, banker, priest, and nun villains. The one highlight of this show is the Spencer Dutton character, played by the dreamy Brandon Sklenar. I can't wait for him to get to the Dutton ranch already, and this show is sure taking its sweet time for that to happen. Frustrating, and enough already. Instead, we get this storyline of Alexandra, his adventurous and rebellious bride, who has also become a very annoying character especially with the way she speaks with a deep cracking voice when trying to say something tongue in cheek. At any rate, if Alexandra gets Spencer Dutton on the screen, I'll take it. Even an annoying character like her doesn't tarnish the interesting mystery of a tough brooding man in Spencer Dutton.","rating":"7\/10","date":"6 March 2023"}
{"title":"Entertaining but subtext is heavy handed.","review":"Yet another spinoff of Yellowstone from Taylor Sheridan. His passion for the subject matter is evident and is only surpassed by his occasional clumsy subtext.Sheridan's politics \"lean\" right, to put it mildly, and his messaging in both Yellowstone and this series are often heavy handed using over-the-top characters or Taylorsplaining dialogue.Example from Yellowstone: The introduction of the Summer Higgins character - A rude vegan who is written as ignorant to all real-world things at Yellowstone but over the course of the season she is schooled both by her life on the ranch and by Beth, who beats her physically and always had the better taunts.An example in 1923: The Taylorsplaining by Jacob Dutton in the middle of s1ep7 of how evil government is and how it's coming to take your speech and other rights. Maybe a little more subtlety would have been in order. He even has the Indian characters jumping on the bandwagon -\"Who shoes horses? Government.\" Well actually \"the white man\" or \"everyone but us\" would have been better answers. BTW, the treatment of the Native American girls by the church is an abomination and unfortunately is probably an accurate representation.Regardless of some of its shortcomings, I give the series a 7.5 for entertainment value.","rating":"7\/10","date":"22 February 2023"}

That's well over fifty percent, for a series trending at 8.6 with 11k marks and counting... and counting. Many of the 7 reviews are actually far from positive. I haven't read all of the 8 and over reviews, but what I have leads me to believe that the services of chatgpt have been well engaged. And for an average score this high, with this strangely elevated vote count, relative to the actual sentiments expressed by over fifty percent of real people, there is little doubt some algos have been recruited as well.

{"title":"NOT DUTTONS","review":"In 1883 we saw the Duttons move\nand claim their land in Montana.In the first episode of 1923, it is clearly stated that Elsa Dutton's mother's brother (Harrison Ford) comes to raise the boys and tend the land. He makes an empire out of this place. All of this is clearly stated in the first episode.With this being said, they are not Dutton's. Elsa's mother would have had a maiden name not being Dutton. Am I missing something here? I don't think so it's very clear that these are the maternal relatives and their name would not be Dutton. Overlooking this one flaw, I find this series to be quite good. I'm looking forward to the second season when the nephew is Spencer makes his way home finally.","rating":"7\/10","date":"21 April 2023"}

Please, address this for future viewers. We really enjoy the 1883, 1923 and Yellowstone. As an equestrian the horsemanship is great. The scenic shots of both America and Africa are amazing.

{"title":"Don't waste your time","review":"Okay... how on earth can this be a sequel to the amazing 1883? This show was terrible. Are we kidding? The main love interests were so terrible and SO cheesy! As in Spencer would suddenly fall madly in love with Alex of all women. And she was exhausting. And the poor native girls in that school! With the terrible abusive nuns! It was as if they just wanted to depict sex and most terrible abuse you can think of, without any other story line. It was what's wrong with all American television. Not enough character development and only caring how pretty the actors are. 1883 had a lot of realistic elements. The romance was maybe a little over the top. This one was like watching some marvel super hero wrestle two lionesses and kill them with his bare hands? What the heck. Lame. Ending is lame. Stop after 1883 and I hope that they don't continue with this show. The ending made me think they will though...","rating":"2\/10","date":"21 April 2023"}

We get it, it's dark where the scene is being filmed, but presumably the production company has location lighting available to properly light the scene. I''m in the first 15 minutes and there have already been two scenes where I've been reduced to hearing dialogue against a black screen where nothing can be seen or made out. Who thought this was a good idea, and why? If this is an artistic choice on the part of the director, i'd say it was poorly conceived. I haven't seen enough of the series thus far to have an opinion regarding the story content.","rating":"6\/10","date":"26 December 2022"}
{"title":"Confusing and hard to follow","review":"As much as I love the franchise, Yellowstone is exhilarating to say the least but doesn't seem so much as historically prominent, 1883 was awesome and felt more thoroughly researched , but this new prequel 1923, is difficult to follow for me, its all over the place, bouncing from area to area and people to people, cant keep up with who is who and what they're doing and how they fit into the family. The cast is great of course, but parts of the story are very disturbing and hard to watch, especially the mistreatment of the Indian girls by Nuns no less smh. Its hard to realize how bad they were treated in that day and time in the USA smh. Hopefully things will start to come clearer for me soon as the story progresses lol. I'm guessing there was a lot of in-depth research done to make sure the info is true and on point, so as not to be misleading to those of us who weren't there, but I would've had a difficult time going through that research finding all this info on the mistreatment of the people during that time smh. I surely hope the remainder of the series gets easier to watch.","rating":"7\/10","date":"30 December 2022"}

It's disappointing that so many fine actors that have done so many great roles chose to take part in this series.

{"title":"Huge misser after 1883","review":"While I BEYOND loved 1883 (and Yellowstone), with its beautiful scripts, narrating and extraordinary acting, I found 1923 a total disappointment:Too many storylines that don't add value to the main storyline. Even the main storyline moves forward too slow, with countless irrelevant sidetracks.The character Alex is unbelievably annoying for so many reasons. If she was intended to replace Elsa's playful, fierce look on the world, this was the biggest flop of the series.Elsa's narrating is used, yet only a few times, and - again - only half baked, and with way less \"spiritual\" insights than in 1883.

{"title":"Extremely slow and unnecessarily gruesome","review":"Bookended by 1883 and Yellowstone are the strengths of this series. The story is unnecessarily slow, and lingers on depictions of sexual violence for far too long. The pacing is way too slow, and by the last episode, it had gone from \"must see\" to \"watch if nothing else is on,\" for me. I'm interested in the Duttons generational story, but at this pace, it will never be told, because viewers will grow tired of the protracted story, that could be too more efficiently told while still including plenty mesmerizing visuals of Montana and Cowboy life. Sheridan, with all his series, is being spread thinly and i suspect that he may \"Game-of-Thrones\" the Yellowstone universe. Tighten it and tell stories that make an grand epic.","rating":"5\/10","date":"5 March 2023"}
{"title":"Overall, it disappointed, considering the praise it had gotten","review":"1923 presents a mixed bag, weaving interconnected storylines but stumbling in various areas.Notably, Jacob Dutton's depiction as an old wimp lacking strategic intellect and grit disappoints.The drawn-out and overdramatized romance between Spencer and Alex overstays its welcome, bogging down the narrative.The delayed climax of Spencer's return as the Dutton legacy's savior and warrior arrives too late, dampening viewer interest during the show.The show's excessive mini drama stories and irrelevant violence over western violence detract from its historical authenticity.It felt like a soap opera and didn't have the magic of 1883 or Yellowstone.Despite some engaging moments, the lack of impact by episode 6 leaves viewers disenchanted, leading to a disappointing finale with episode 8 which is an utter disappointment of the show.TV shows that I score 8 and above are exceptional, with minimal flaws, while those I score 7 or below are good, but fall short of reaching the elite tier.","rating":"7\/10","date":"17 April 2024"}

I don't care about any of the characters. Too many and none are distinct. The setting makes such a strong impact in Yellowstone but is forgettable here. Painfully dull with three competing narratives with no connection between the storylines. As others have noted, this is strongly reminiscent of Legends of the Fall, a movie which I never cared for. Two episodes in and I don't have any idea what the main storyline is or who we're supposed to care about. I'll stick to Tulsa King.Update 2\/19\/23. God-awful.

{"title":"Rote melodrama with nary an original thought or idea. Visual, verbal, and thematic bore.","review":"Once again, I have gone against my better instincts to watch an acclaimed show created by a streaming service, this time on Paramount+, which already has a fairly poor track record. Outside their turgid Star Trek shows, they have the Yellowstone franchise, which has already yielded us the entertaining if nihilistic spinoff '1883'. Now we jump ahead to the year '1923', and the trouble begins. The performance of Sam Elliot somewhat saved '1883'. It says a lot that not even the presence of Harrison Ford and Helen Mirren can make '1923' even remotely worthwhile.Of course, these two stars, the only real ones the show has to offer, are only there a fraction of the time. In true streaming fashion, the narrative is split up into a bunch of dragged-out plot lines, none of which are any good.Thread No. 1 follows the Dutton family, now played by Ford and Mirren. They play sheep farmers who have conflicts with other sheep farmers. If this doesn't sound like the most fascinating plot ever, that's only because I haven't yet described the filler threads that showrunner Tayler Sheridan uncorks from his posterior and wraps around everything.Thread No. 2 follows their nephew Spencer, who is big game hunting in Africa (?), killing all kinds of animals for fun. Eventually he meets a British woman, and, callous colonist-sympathizer that he is, falls in love with her. Their snail-paced romance takes them across oceans of melodrama along with literal oceans. Occasionally they grace us with tantalizing bits of nudity; someone has to fund the intimacy coordinators. Obviously that is the prime purpose for this plot-line since it barely relates to the other ones.Thread No. 3 is by far the most dopey; an anachronistic misery-porn tale of Native Americans being abused at a boarding school run by violent priests and evil nuns. These segments are stuffed with over-the-top violence, all in an attempt to wring sympathy from the viewer. It's like Sheridan is trying to be the flip-side anti-Catholic version of Mel Gibson, but lacks the latter's emotional sincerity (let alone storytelling acumen)---he's less laying his tortured soul to bare and more violating the story with shallow activist stereotypes. For, despite his constant pessimism and supposed realism everywhere else, he can't depict the Indians as anything other than noble put-upon victims of cartoonishly perverted Christians. Disney's Pocahontas for the revisionist rabble. It's inane. It's pandering. It's pathetic.","rating":"1\/10","date":"1 March 2023"}

After this he takes on a couple hundred German soldiers with just a knife and pistol but comes out on top. I ignored these things along with other bs and the usual ignorance about Americans 'owning land' (if I turn up and murder a town in America now I'm a mass murderer, if I did it 150 years ago to the people it really belonged too I'm a settler) The turn off point for me was in episode 2 when attacked by 2 leopards, which never happens even as they tried to bs away by saying they're a mating pair (they don't hunt while mating) superman again survives with barely a scratch.

{"title":"A Somewhat Disappointing Spinoff Of Yellowstone","review":"A somewhat disappointing spinoff of Yellowstone, in which most of the characters are cartoonish.The casting is generally not bad, Helen Mirren is excellent, and Harrison Ford, although one of my favourite actors, looks a little too old for this role.The characters are caricatures, especially the nuns and priests. They are so evil, it's hilarious. Well, this isn't a documentary after all, it's fiction.Brandon Sklenar is perhaps the only character, besides the character played by Helen Mirren, who looks and behaves like a somewhat normal human being. In any case, the quality is nowhere near Yellowstone, where the characters are complex and layered.This all looks like another one of those shows where instead of having fun, we get another hard lesson about how all people are evil, and some are especially evil. It has become tiresome and destroys any possibility of fun.It's a shame, I was expecting something close to the quality of Yellowstone, and I got another boring and tedious series that isn't really worth watching.Too bad, this could have been great.","rating":"4\/10","date":"27 December 2022"}

The only character worth caring about is the Indian girl. Sure hope she gets a happy ending, all the rest are hard to have any sympathy or concern about.

{"title":"Just one long, drawn out scene for shock value after another","review":"I loved 1883 and really enjoy Yellowstone, but I have had it with 1923. I get it history was brutal; many situations present day are brutal. Humans have a way of bringing out the worst in each other. Someone always wants what the other has. It's a story as old as time, but I don't need to be reminded of it every time I try to watch a show I looked forward to and should enjoy. This show is just too much all the way around - it's violence against women, violence against Asian Americans, violence against Native Americans, Big Industry vs. The little guy, the Royal Family vs. A commoner, the violence committed by leaders of the Catholic Church, etc. How many social issues are you all trying to pack into one show? It is just one long, drawn out scene after the next. The story doesn't actually move; it's just a bunch of shock value. You want a shock value scene here and there, fine, but this is just over the top. The character I have really enjoyed is Spencer and his love interest. They make her out to be a babbling bimbo, but I figured Montana would mature that character. I miss the voice over of Elsa. I really liked that. I've lost interest in the show. Time to find something else.","rating":"2\/10","date":"28 February 2023"}
{"title":"Seems drug out","review":"The story lines seem so drug out. It's going in 4 directions and seems to be in the super slow lane with all.It's been several episodes of the perils of Alex and Spencer trying to voyage back to Montana.Shes allegedly British however her accent is non existing. So much time is spent on their relationship scenes. I understand he is part of the main family. But too much time is spent on his un-story.Could be alot better done...... with the multiple story lines which leaves alot unknown all tied into each epidosde. It makes it almost hard to follow along.The previous prequel(1883) is much better. This one seems forced.","rating":"4\/10","date":"20 February 2023"}
{"title":"Spencer's girlfriend is turning me off from the show.","review":"I don't know if it's just me, but I cannot can't stand Spencer's girlfriend!! I absolutely hate it when they spend an entire episode on Spencer and his super annoying girlfriend! SHE IS BEYOND ANNOYING!! The show can do without her REALLY. Every time she's in danger, I want her to be eaten by a lion....a shark.....elephant or just drown in the ocean. Who thought she was a good addition to the show?!!! Her face is just not easy to look for at that long. I'm sorry but I can't. I'd rather look at an avocado tree grow!! Everything else is great on the show...but when it's an entire episode spent on him & her...I just get mad because I feel like wasted so much time and I can't ever get that time back!!! I'm not trying to be mean, I just think her role is terrible and overly annoying & they give her too much camera time. Almost like pointless content. Good thing is that I didn't see her in the Dutton family tree. Lol!","rating":"2\/10","date":"14 February 2023"}
{"title":"Such potential mostly wasted","review":"Great cast, great period costumes, amazing landscapes wasted on this melodramatic downer riddled with gratuitous brutality and pervasive injustices toward the characters we're supposed to sympathize with. Apparently the cliff hangers are supposed to make viewers return for season two, but they just underscored the glacially slow pace and lack of satisfying resolution of the multiple story lines. Though the mores of the time are depicted, that's uneven\/ Arrive for Ford and Mirren (and the rest of the cast) and the scenery. Leave for the gratuitous brutality, thick melodrama, and grimness. Overall, a case of largely wasted potential.","rating":"4\/10","date":"26 February 2023"}
{"title":"Boring beyond belief","review":"Prequels are not easy on TV or in films. Often they are disastrous, like the Sopranos prequel on TV or the Butch Cassidy prequel in film. TV avoids them, but films don't, yet about the only prequel that outdid the sequel was The Godfather 2. IMO Not a single TV prequel was any good (think Bates Motel v Psycho) and this one is just like those.I didn't see Yellowstone but I don't think a prequel requires seeing the original to make a judgment about the prequel. I did avoid Yellowstone because when I glimpsed portions, it seemed boring. Little did I know that you could be even more boring.FWIW I'm a big Western fan. My best films of all time include westerns (Wild Bunch, Jeremiah Johnson, Outlaw Josey Wales, Ride the High Country, the Magnificent 7, etc.)This series is boring. Hard to keep my eyes open. When they were open I saw Helen Mirren failing to keep her accent and looking as bored as I was. Harrison Ford seems to be wandering around as if he's at his ranch rather than being filmed.","rating":"2\/10","date":"26 January 2023"}
{"title":"Three or Four Episodes Drawn Out to Nine","review":"Given this family's history and future, and the time it takes place in, this had the groundwork to be the best of the Yellowstone universe. The casting was excellent, the three storylines had powerful foundations, and the costumes and cinematography were incredible.But the timing absolutely flopped here. Taylor Sheridan was clearly distracted with Yellowstone or another project when producing this one. The episodes are unbelievably drawn out to the point where an episode ends and you ask yourself, \"Okay, what actually happened? Nothing.\" Spencer and Alex's storyline started as the most interesting, then became completely unrealistic. One thing after another just makes the viewer go \"OH COME ON.\" The whole point of the season is to see what happens when the Duttons have to defend against Dalton's character and yet it never happens, and Spencer is still on the other side of the ocean, basically where he started, and the Duttons have chose to do nothing but sit and wait for him to arrive. We're basically watching paint dry at the Ranch.Teonna's storyline is heartbreaking and gripping, and Aminah's acting is incredible. But her storyline also could have been told so much more powerfully in half the time.It seems to me that Sheridan is purposely drawing out a one-season story into two seasons just for the sake of making an extra buck. We'll watch because we're invested in the family, but nothing about this season has been satisfying from an entertainment perspective.","rating":"3\/10","date":"27 February 2023"}

I'll wait for Yellowstone to come back on. Big disappointment. 1883 was incredible. I loved it. This sequel is just bad. The torture of the Indians brings our history to its knees. Shame on us. Those poor people. This part needs to be told but why ruin it by nudity, sex? I know, I know a lot will think I'm a prude but I don't need to see a naked woman bent over a table while another naked woman beats her with belt. Sorry but just too sick for me.

I loved 1883 but I'm finding the utter violence portrayed in the story about the Indian school and the surrounding take on religious themes being evil very hard to take. There are messed up people in every part of society but we don't accuse everyone in those situations of such hideous cruelty and ignorance. The last edition of 1923 was despicable in this portrayal of senseless violence and now nudity on top of that! I don't care for the actors except, Mirrren,the man who plays Spencer and the ranch boss. Yuck to this drival.","rating":"3\/10","date":"20 February 2023"}
{"title":"Latter Half drags a lot with a confirmed Season 2","review":"It would seem that 1923 Season 1 has 2 seasons with the first 4 episodes broadcast in Jan 2023. That was great and just like 1883, one hoped that the story would end in 1 season as there was not enough for Season 2. But then around early Jan 23, 1923 got a greenlight for Season 2. That changed the next 4 episodes look stretched out and dragged. Seems more like what was earlier for 4 episodes will now be shown in 12!!. So you get all sorts of tangents including a terrible and boring version of any English rom-com on a ship. That was helmed by a beautiful but outrageously bad stereotypical English actress. Episodes 5 to 8 were so bad that one could fast forward and not skip anything but the boredom.","rating":"4\/10","date":"28 February 2023"}
{"title":"Needs help","review":"I really loved 1883 and the original Yellowstone but this installment is seriously lacking. You are telling three different stories that don't relate to each other. A lot of good actors but no real story. Having two hookers spank each other with a belt?? Is that really part of this story. I don't understand what the writers are trying do with this. How can you make two great stories and then fail this poorly with such great actors. Many scenes are much too drawn out and leave you wanting to say \"come on already\". Pitiful use of what could have been another hit. This is definitely a huge miss. Awful!!!","rating":"3\/10","date":"27 February 2023"}
{"title":"Slow moving and arduous","review":"I keep hoping that Spencer will arrive at the Yellowstone property, preferably without Alex (Julia Schlaepfer), her incredibly appalling English accent and zero on screen chemistry with Spencer. It is beyond me as to why an English actress could not have been chosen for this role. I constantly cringe during every over-acted scene that she is in and only hang in because I have enjoyed 1883 and Yellowstone so much.I'm finding this slow moving and arduous, six episodes in, although I have enjoyed the Indian School storyline. Furthermore, I have no idea where this storyline is heading, however I guess all will be revealed in time. I live in hope that Spencer arrives home before the final episode of season one, as I do not believe I could sit through another season of this snooze fest.","rating":"4\/10","date":"12 February 2023"}
{"title":"Helen Mirren is amazing, the rest just rolling downhill","review":"Massive Yellowstone fan, loved 1883 even more, thought Taylor Sheridan couldn't help but produce hit after hit with this universe... and then I started watching 1923.Helen Mirren singlehandedly makes this series worth watching just for her performance. Very believable, compelling, transports you into the world, just like most \/ all characters from the other two series do. Harrison Ford is ok, but no match to his onscreen partner... however perhaps there will be more promise in the latter half of the season as the latest episode seems to show a shift in his character.But by far the storyline, and one particular actress in that storyline, that really lets this series down, is the whole Spencer and Alex thread. The chemistry between them is completely non-existent and given the intense love and chemistry that has been seen by Beth and Rip in Yellowstone or from Elsa in 1883, this pairing is completely unrecognisable within this universe. And what makes the whole thing excruciating to watch is in particular Alex. Her fake English accent is really hard to listen to, especially when she decides to lower her voice to channel the spirit of Winston Churchill or someone similar, whilst trying to interact with Spencer and portray \"chemistry\". Its really really hard to watch!So on the whole, this series has for the most part been a let down, especially when considering the heights that were reached with Yellowstone and 1883. Whatever they changed for this series, I really hope they change it back for future series otherwise the magic will truly be lost.","rating":"4\/10","date":"15 February 2023"}
{"title":"Was good in the beginning- now I'm missing over half the show","review":"I was super excited for this show and get the subscription for it, watched the first 3 episodes and was hooked on the main storyline.The opposite for the opposing storyline wanted to scream at scenes of the Catholic verses natives. The second, totally unnecessary storyline, of the nuns harming the schooled native children was appalling. The whole thing- all the way to episode 8 has been this way. First off- totally disgusting Movies for shock value are not my thing. I don't appreciate the nudity that started throughout the whole episodes from #4 on. Not only of Rainwater gal- but of all the women. Especially the dance hall gals. I'm now missing over half of each episode for how they're filling in the story to make the episodes longer with nudity- brutality- and racism. Thanks-No Thanks. Seriously DO BETTER.The only reason I stuck with it so far was for spencer- and Harrison Ford and the wife. The only reason this review has any stars is for those 3 people and the storyline behind them.The rest has been dung.I also was disappointed at how Harrison strung up the bad guys- they needed to have done something worse in real life for Harrison's character.","rating":"3\/10","date":"27 February 2023"}

Why do you have to ruin it with completely unnecessary sex, nudity...basically porn? It has NOTHING to do with the storyline and trashes the whole show. It's a total shame! It was tolerable when there were romantic intentions but then you have to up the gross by adding prostitutes, nudity and lesbians...and just when you think that you've fast forwarded through it...it comes back again for absolutely no reason. Extremely disappointing and unnecessary.

{"title":"Initially good, then too much doom and gloom","review":"Initially loved this, but as the stories progressed the who show became full of negative story lines, gratuitous violence and some boring acting as some scenes became soppy and over acted. Brilliant acting from some of the leads, but the doom and gloom just became tedious and depressing. I'm not shy of violence in TV shows, but the amount of cruel violence here, plus some real creepy kinky sex scenes, which though plausible are just, for me, over done and too confronting. Hopefully the show can be salvaged in series two and some positive story lines added. Despite my negative review, the show is still worth a watch.","rating":"5\/10","date":"5 March 2023"}
{"title":"The script is more clunky than a Model T Ford","review":"Whoever wrote this script has 2 tin ears. It happily kills off the minor characters so the righteous indignation of the mayor ones allows them to indulge in brutal violence.The pompous speeches, the the feather weight philosophising and the Luddite hatred of all things new is soooo dull... these characters predict the future so well, I am sure the dolts who cherish this crap will idolise them.And don't get me started on the British love interest. Only a yank script writer could think she would speak that way. God she is so irritating!This whole genre of new cowboy shows are somewhat insidious. They are a new kind of revisionist crap, they pay lip service to being more even handed regarding treatment of indigenous people etc but in the end hold up the traditional values that saw them slaughtered.Oh and the bad guys are pantomime bad !","rating":"3\/10","date":"27 February 2023"}
{"title":"Great film quality but the writing really lacks in quality.","review":"As the season goes on, you get many questions by the end of the season, none of those questions are answered. The film quality and acting is stunning the writing leaves a lot unanswered and everything is a cliff hanger. Too bad film quality and acting quality isn't enough to sell the beginning of a story that never goes anywhere. I wish there was more to say about the show good or bad, but no questions were answered. I really expected more out of Taylor Sheridan. He's considered one of the top show producers right now, but this show really brings down his overall quality. I think he's making too many shows right now, so he can't focus on a good one. A lot of the end of this was just a fill of space and personal opinions.","rating":"2\/10","date":"28 February 2023"}
{"title":"Left Hanging","review":"This is just another one of those series that is going to run on and on. Poor acting! Especially by Harrison Ford. Multiple story lines that don't seem to be related to each other especially the residential school stories. No ending to all these story lines. Much like the Yellowstone series. This is very disappointing after viewing all eight episodes. Unless you like stories with no endings, I would not recommend seeing until they have another season and I could only view it after reading all the reviews in hope that they may have endings to all of these multiple stories. Would not recommend viewing this series.","rating":"5\/10","date":"21 June 2023"}
{"title":"Real men.","review":"At first glance the 20s street scene seemed to suggest there might be room in the series to set it against some interesting social history, but the camera quickly rolls past the screaming temperance women to focus on the real meat of the drama, a group of suitably grizzled generic rancher types led by gravelly voiced Harrison Ford. Jerome Flynn goes over the top as a generic English sheep farmer, surrounded by more generic sheep farmers. These scenes were followed by the obligatory Indian school brutality scene, where we were treated to a feast of generic psychopathic nuns and clergy. Violence, or threatened violence, seems to be the beginning and end of it. There is no proper script, since all speak in clich\u221a\u00a9s, no actual characterisation, and no real people, apart from the single proper actor in the briefly visible form of Helen Mirren. Unfortunately Mirren has nothing much to do in this world of gruff, generic rancher types. A catastrophic mess that almost achieves the status of parody.","rating":"1\/10","date":"19 February 2023"}
{"title":"Just a little too silly","review":"This is such a disappointment. The combination of Harrison Ford and Helen Mirren in a western setting promised so much but I'm afraid this is a fairly ridiculous production which I couldn't get to the end of. Whilst there were a number of daft scenes in the first episode the actions of Harrison Ford's character in deciding to casually hang a number of men at the end of episode two defied all morality and common sense. That act was made more ridiculous too by leaving the men tied up and sitting on their horses. The somewhat far fetched African hunter scenes seemed grounded in comparison! At least that segment also had a lightness to it that the western segment desperately lacked. I'm afraid I'm bailing out mid season. Hopefully it will improve but life is too short to invest more time in this.","rating":"5\/10","date":"23 April 2023"}
{"title":"Too slow.","review":"One to many. Great actors shame about the direction and timing. Should have been four episodes. Very disappointed and resentful that I had felt I had to watch after such a promising start. You owe me four hours of my life. I felt that many actors particularly Alex were caricatures. How could you have made such a mess? Sometimes I had to turn off the sound and skip scenes. I do not like being negative but this was really awful and made me even more appreciative of the BBC and excellent dramas like Happy Valley. When will streamers learn that the longer you take and the more money you spend to stretch a thin plot the more people switch off.","rating":"1\/10","date":"4 March 2023"}
{"title":"Underwhelming season 1; slow and unrewarding","review":"The character development is slow with obstacle after unbelievable obstacle placed in front of the protagonist, Spencer, as he tries to return home. This series is so much slower and more boring than 1883. 1883 had the pace and excitement of an extended movie, with strong progressing narrative episodes partnered with continuous character development that keeps you interested. Much like a Band of Brothers approach; story, momentum, and self-contained to one season.1923 has interesting characters but they grow so slowly it's boring to watch. The first couple of episodes established a lot of promise for the quality of the series but then the narrative just stalled to a snail's pace. It's an absolutely tedious series compared with 1883 and doesn't match the expectations created by the previous series, nor even its much-enjoyed predecessor, Yellowstone.In 1923, we are acutely (sooo acutely) learning the difficulties faced by this pioneering family but they are boring to watch and over emphasised. The most interesting story arc is that of the Native American girl overcoming her horrible oppressors and finding a path back to her life with family and on the land. The Dutton-side of the narrative is a broken record of \"we are downtrodden and old\" and the journey of Spencer and his American-as-British (terrible accent) wife is full of nonsensical difficulties. I tried embracing the nonsense of their journey but then we got to the end of the season and we hadn't really gotten anywhere. It was so boring and I feel deceived; like this is the click-bait version of a tv series: all promise and underwhelming delivery. 1883 and Yellowstone are brilliant but 1923 is just flogging a dead horse. It could be great if the episodes we halved and pace doubled.","rating":"5\/10","date":"26 February 2023"}
{"title":"What is the point","review":"Can't understand if this Sheridan fellow wants me to like the Dutton or hate them. They do not have any redeeming qualities other than the selfish desire to keep what they have acquired over time. Keep it or at the very least not allow others to have it. They love the view so much that they are willing to kill to keep it and are unwilling to allow others to gaze upon it. And while I do like Spencer - I just watched the episode where he tosses a master swordsman overboard after he himself having never held one disarmed the master twice and then was able duck away from a pistol being wielded by the very same master swordsman. This seems like some very convenient writing on someone's part and I will say that my fervent desire is that there is an end to this series so that I don't have to watch it with the hope on my heart that I get to see all those idiots die. Please Sheridan - write reality just a little better.","rating":"2\/10","date":"25 December 2022"}
{"title":"Waste of time","review":"I love Yellowstone and I enjoyed 1883 more than I expected to. I had no idea who the stars of that show were, but when I found they were country singers, I was hesitant. That said, they did provide wonderful, authentic feeling performances.I was truly excited to start this series, but so far, it has fallen flat. This show, 1923 is a wash out so far after two episodes. The story line is all over the place; it is disjointed and confusing. Harrison Ford is not believable as a cowboy, but I think it is more the script than his acting. It seems Helen Mirren is not much of a presence as they spend too much time with alternate story lines.Switching to Africa where leopards are killing people is too far-fetched for my taste. The scene where Harrison Ford decides to hang the men who had the audacity to graze their sheep on land he wanted for his cows, was totally bizarre; his acting that scene was ingenuine and forced.I read it will end with the 2nd season. I doubt I will make it past the first.","rating":"5\/10","date":"26 December 2022"}

Will he take acting lessons before series 2?At what stage will Danaerys Targyran step in with her dragons - the only way I can see of salvaging anything from this miserable plot?The Catholic Church seems to take a bit of a beating too - wouldn't it be nice if some of the other unpleasant religions were pilloried too?","rating":"4\/10","date":"1 March 2023"}

How many times do we need to see those two kissing and looking into each others eyes? Are they trying to show us the passion they have for each other? Because it's failing that and just tedious rubbish. At a guess I would say it's about 2.5 hours of this nonsense.Not to mention when they were stuck in the ocean on the upturned boat and he fought off sharks with a rifle that came of nowhere.... After they had been stuck on safari in a tree fighting of lions with the same rifle.It's absolute garbage.

Violence in shows don't typically bother me, but there's something so vile about what happens in this show, it's disturbing. I can't decide if the writers are trying to convey what happened to Native American girls or are trying to live out some type of depraved fantasy.All other characters in the show have defined motivations, but scenes with the priest, nuns and Native Americans seem to be there just for the sake of violence. Outside of that, the writing is good and the acting great.","rating":"5\/10","date":"14 February 2023"}

Yes, this is a straight-up soap opera dressed up vaguely like a drama\/action series. If it were a less-enlightened age I'd type that Sheridan's oft bizarre heights of success are solely based on this satisfy-wife's-soap-opera cravings while tricking husband into thinking more action will happen than ever does,Remember, I wrote *if* we were in a less enlightened age, so no beating me up, that was just the easiest explanatory shorthand.

Sunset kisses and cheap dialogues like Danniel Steel books.Beautifull blond ladies with fake lashes lips and hair styled at the farm like going to the prom.Acting of most of characters paralel to the dialogues hard as timber in Montana.Also hard to stand this Brazilian soap opera poses.Extremelly dissapointed.","rating":"1\/10","date":"12 March 2023"}
{"title":"Execrable","review":"From the highs of 1883, 1923 charts the decline in quality to the lows of Yellowstone.1923 is where the Duttons started overacting and the screenplay started straining everyone's credulity. Nasty attempts at Scottish accents, mixed up history and a bunch of yeehaw Murcan ranchers makes it hard to like any of the characters. The show is a mess of competing themes and moronically simple storylines. I know this is supposed to draw people to watch Yellowstone but they really should have left it at 1883 - a far superior show than either 1923 or Yellowstone.Feels like it would have been better if this series had died on the nineteenth century prairie as did most of the cast of 1883.","rating":"4\/10","date":"5 April 2023"}
{"title":"It's a total car crash...","review":"Before I start: I hardly ever write reviews. I'm usually so engrossed in the story, I don't think about it. Watching 1923 changed this. During the whole season, my voice in my head went: got to warn people. This is dross. It's pulp.And here is why. So Yellowstone is amazing, in every aspect. The studio (?) probably thought: lets milk this some more. 1883 was produced and was also a great show. Another hit.Then someone said: lets keep on going. Having seen 1923, it feels like Taylor Sheridan only lent his name to this and a writers room was established, where they started with: we need some big name elderly actors. Check. A young hot shot and a pretty girl. Check. And we need a mysterious brooding dude for the romantic parts. Check. Oh, and we need gratitious nudity and romance but also rough violence.And we got it. The dialogue writing is terrible. The story lines utterly unbelievable and lacking of logic. Harrison Ford acts Harrison Ford. The blond and pretty Michelle Randolph was miscast as she belongs in a Baywatch movie based in California, not 1923 poor Montana. Brandon Sklenar is supposed to be a brooding Montgomery Clift or James Dean but ends up being a card board boring sullen numbnuts making bad decision after bad decision while his love interest is simply annoying with her incessant jabbering. Their journey in this story is completely and utterly un-realistic. They simply have to endure everything one can imagine. Attacked by lions, by evil people, shipwrecks, shark attacks and more. Martians coming in, dinosaurs on the rampage and a bout of diahrrea were all that was missing from their story.And then the violence. It's simply revenge porn, this movie. Utter atrocities are interchanged with sappy sugar sweet and overlong romantic scenes. The only actors capable of shining are Helen Mirren, strong as ever, Jerome Flynn as the bad dude and Jennifer Ehle cast against type as the nun from hell. I had to take a shower after viewing this tv show. Utter crap and I say this with respect for Taylor Sheridan and all he brought us before this. Give this one a big miss.","rating":"2\/10","date":"23 March 2023"}

I won't watch this show anymore, nor will I watch any of the other Yellowstone shows solely on principal. I feel like walking dead and game of thrones started that crap so now every show thinks if they do the same thing it will make them a good show. Instead of coming up with their own creative ways of keeping an audience, they follow a practice that is taking advantage of people.

Priests are savage who kill for Christ. Native Americans are treated as less than dirt. If you are looking for man's inhumanity to man- this is for you.If you must watch, only the scenes with Helen Mirin, Harrison. Ford & the characters in Africa are worthwhile. All other characters are merely 2 dimensional.My guess is the the very talented Taylor Sheridan is now either exercising his demons, over extended or farming this out.It's quite sad, in my thinking.","rating":"1\/10","date":"20 February 2023"}

Harrison Ford looks very thin and aged and has no strength in his voice to command that he's the top guy you're not supposed to want to cross. It all seems like they're still rehearsing and haven't got it right yet. And the story line!! The English lady who thought she could catch up with a moving car?

It started well but the last couple of episodes have been 75% flannel. Why has he resorted to gratuitous nudity and over-long love interest scenes? He didn't need it in his other series. That's normally only used to get (some) viewers interested when a series starts, such as Game of Thrones etc. Also, what is with the awful upper class English accent employed by Spencer's wife? To be honest, we've been fast forwarding through most of the scenes in which she's been present. First we just laughed. Now it's just utterly annoying.","rating":"5\/10","date":"20 February 2023"}
{"title":"Very disappointing","review":"This is my first ever review, but having just finished the final episode I just had to comment.After thoroughly enjoying 1883 I could not believe how disappointing this show was. There was no continuity in the storylines, all the gore in the religious school, which I guess could well be true, served no real purpose except to create one of the storylines without any relevance to the overall story. This detracts a lot from the superb story and acting in 1883 and even Yellowstone, which I did watch first and enjoyed a lot of it, even what I call the \"bad' bits had relevance to the overall story.

It is so sick that if not for the few minutes of romantic interludes we would have turned this off very early on. This was so disturbing that I will never watch another TS written series ever again. Forget Yellowstone. He should be embarrassed that this came out of his brain. Every episode was filled with one contrived situation after another. The kitchen scene with the two girls was enough to make me feel dirty and just 'icky'. There was not a scene in this series that we didn't say - no way did that ever happen. Shameful.","rating":"1\/10","date":"28 November 2023"}
{"title":"Confusing and disappointing.","review":"I didn't get on with Yellowstone so decided to go back to the beginning. I gave 1883 9 stars and I really enjoyed it so it lit my fire and I was looking forward to this one.I got through two episodes....... Such a massive disappointment. First disappointment was that the family tree veered of course so much without explanation that I had to look it up and find out who Harrison Ford and Helen Mirren even fitted in. They had the same surname but that seemed all.Second disappointment was that Harrison Ford and Helen Mirren were awful. I love both of them but Harrison spent the entire time growling at everyone. I know a ranchers life is hard but honestly, is there any need to walk around looking angry at everyone. Don't get me started on Hellen Mirren's Irish accent. It was completely unnecessary. I mean, if they're come from there why didn't He have an accent too?The whole thing discombobulated me. I expected the time line to follow through with the same characters until they got to John III. Don't expect this. This has got one star because I can't give it none.","rating":"1\/10","date":"29 July 2023"}
{"title":"Amateurish","review":"I came her to see how Harrison does, knowing how badly his latest Indy Jones is doing. Not really much better here.Plodding, verbose, loquacious. Cardboard cutouts for characters. Scenes droning on so long that I threw up my hand's yelling \"okay, we get it. The Catholic School Nun is sadistic! Let's move on!\"\"New\" Socialism ideologies sprinkled in for good measure with oddly feminine male ranch hands and train conductors slipped in to meet diversity quotas. I swear there was a girl dressed in men's clothes with the fakest western mustache I've ever seen.An hour in and I'm done. What is the point of this series?","rating":"3\/10","date":"4 July 2023"}
{"title":"Not up to Yellowstone or 1883","review":"Harrison Ford doesn't convince me. He is a great actor, but he is too old for this part. He doesn't scare me and his gruff cowboy schtick seems forced. The cutaways when he does anything physical are obvious and jarring. Plus, he is only in about 5 minutes per episode.As others have said, the African safari sides are too long and unrelated to the Dutton Ranch. The Indian schools, while a good nod to the bad stuff we did to them, are far too long, too unrealistically brutal (and no spoiler, but the nun while bathing? Please..).Plus this side story drags on far too long and takes away from what little story we have at the ranch. And when we have that story, it is.Yellowstone 10\/10. 1883 10\/10. This one needs help.","rating":"5\/10","date":"29 December 2022"}
{"title":"Forced, Predictable, Boring","review":"Every now and then we're treated a juicy piece of dialogue, but beyond that it seems to start in the same direction Yellowstone has already gone.The characters are shallow and clich\u221a\u00a9. We've seen them already played by different actors in different shows, but they are the same none the less.The story is predictable and somewhat juvenile. There's none of the grit of the original Yellowstone's first seasons and all the soap opera of the its most recent one. In a word, it's simply \"boring\".The wasted potential of this is a shame, especially when you consider how good some of the creator's other projects are.For me, I think I will be bidding farewell to the Duttons all together.","rating":"4\/10","date":"29 December 2022"}
{"title":"Highly overrated","review":"Dropped 5 points just for using the annoying Elsa voice from 1883 & adding the annoying Alex character. How people can listen to those 2 & give a 9\/10 rating is beyond me.She's up in a tree & the lion expert told her to be quiet, & what does she do, makes more & more noise.Every Sheridan story keeps pounding us over the head with his blatant anti-American themes, as if our past history is worse than any other country. If it were up to him we'd have to move because we became America in a way he doesn't approve of, such a pathetic view from a so-called American.Has he ever looked at the history of how many settlers were killed, no, too busy with his propaganda. There are tons of stories where complete families, including kids, were killed when the opportunity arose & probably thousands more that were never reported.Another theme in a lot of Hollywood shows is anti-religion. I'm not religious at all but the constant bashing of religion, as if they were all bad, is really sad. It's all part of their agenda to brainwash the naive. The amount of good they've done far outweighs the bad, but that doesn't deserve any acknowledgement I guess.","rating":"4\/10","date":"15 February 2023"}
{"title":"not worth watching","review":"We first watched 1883 which was pretty good. After watching 1883, we started watching this before watching Yellowstone. However, I think after watching 6 episodes we had quite enough of it. We didnt enjoy watching it at all. It is actually quite terrible. Ruined the good vibe of 1883. The worst part of it is Alex's fake british accent.I feel like all the 6 episodes we have watched could be summarised in maximum two episodes easily. I think if they didnt have stretched it too much it could have become a good series and would have been a nice story before moving on to Yellowstones as recommended by others.","rating":"1\/10","date":"20 February 2023"}

Things were going well until it goes to a story of catholics beating up on non-white girls . And the scene went on for some time.The thing is I'm sick of these tropes and themes from Hollywood. I might be wrong , but it is meant to stir drama and emotion and work the viewer - psychologically speaking.Why these ideas ? Thd non-whites.. are they the victims? And the evil oppressors. ... the catholics ?I'll see how the episodes go from here. But any more ideas that I don't approve ...and it's going off.Thanks for reading.","rating":"5\/10","date":"19 December 2022"}
{"title":"Terrible Storyline","review":"This show does nothing but promote rich over poor, bad over good, supposed class over normal people and the terrible treatment early Americans laid upon native Americans. You can have all the beautiful mountains and ranges that you want, all the good acting and directing that you want but to continually show the cruelness and stupidity of the human race is ridiculous. This is nothing but a terrible show and does not deserve to be aired. Unfortunately I cannot think of enough words to describe the arrogance this show perpetuates but I will just say it is a disgrace that people are willing to spend their watching such trash.","rating":"4\/10","date":"27 February 2023"}
{"title":"Bad writing and horrible acting for the support cast","review":"The plot in Montana is nice but it Is too thin. The b and c plots are also thin, but they are also poorly written. This is made more obvious with horrible acting.Th c plot is cultural token way to address the Native Americans plight.The Africa\/ Spencer story is too long and irrelevant. His live interest is played by an actress wiling to do nude scenes. They give her lines with more than three words and it is just a monotonous string of garbage. Their story is nonsense and does nothing to further the storyline. The subplots are ridiculous and not realistic. I am sure they will only reduce the Montana plot to garbage once they combine them.Not even Mirim or Ford could save these peoples lack of acting skills.","rating":"2\/10","date":"26 March 2023"}
{"title":"So, what is it really about?","review":"There's 3 storylines. Ancestors of Yellowstone's nasty cattle ranching characters are fighting Irish sheep herders in bloody fights. Okay. Their WWI soldier relative is a hunter in Africa who needs to return as his family suffers in these fights. Allright. But there's non of the edge of your seat, moving moments of the other prequel. Most distressing is a story line of the brutal treatment of native American women in a Catholic school which after 4 episodes has zero connection to anything else. And that's where I decided, regardless of the two fine stars, enough and goodbye. 1884 had great characters and a linear story of the real west settlement struggles. This is just nasty.","rating":"4\/10","date":"15 January 2023"}
{"title":"The colonial Kenya storyline is cliched rubbish","review":"Only watched this for the Africa segment, hoping for some semblance of a colonial era Kenya storyline, came out completely underwhelmed by the acting and story there. Sheridan did minimal work researching the region, for the time and setting, and it shows in the tripe excuse for a colonial Kenya storyline.Apathetic American guy with PTSD is seemingly the ONLY one who knows anything about wildlife despite Kenya being a British protectorate at the time (I'll give Sheridan credit for checking Wikipedia at least for that bit). As expected, all of the Brits are ignorant, etc, apparently White Africans don't exist in Sheridan's universe (ones who would often work in these wildlife management jobs and function as hunters).The story tries hard to make it look like only the American is fair to the native Kenyans and treats them as equals, but in reality they are treated as incompetent buffoons by him when it comes to the hunt, more like his minority sidekicks to prove just how better he is than the actual white residents of the colony, rather than them functioning as actual trackers or gun bearers of any competency or agency. For historical note, many trackers and gunbearers often saved the lives of their white colleagues and employers. They were pros. The ones in 1923 hide in the bottom of a tent for the majority of the actual hunt like scared babies.On that note, the American isn't a very good hunter either, as it was his yelling out that endangered the lives of his two native Kenyan friends who ran to the rescue. He is then so insistent blaming the evil colonial Englishman, yet shows 0 remorse for his own actions that directly got his friend killed. Of course, Sheridan writes the British colonial character ignorant of the fact a female leopard might maul someone. Laughable! Only the American knows anything about animals, yet most of these colonists have lived there for already decades.Sheridan's American grumbling-apathetic warhero with a deathwish who comes to dispense justice to the evil colonial empire makes all of the Englishwomen enamored, tittering and flirting because they've never seen an American before (give me a break). We already know he'll enter into a tryst with the engaged Englishwoman who I can only assume has a much older fiance.Apparently these types of protagonists are the norm for Sheridan's writing, so I won't be back for more of this cliched, poorly written slop soap-opera-in-disguise that unfortunately had to include a poor glimpse of colonial Africa.","rating":"2\/10","date":"29 December 2022"}
{"title":"Drawn out piffle","review":"This is the most drawn out, boring show of all of the Yellowstone genera. 1883 was depressing but held interest, Yellowstone is a soap opera in cowboy hats- but a guilty pleasure. This one is just so boring. The entire series is just wrapped around Spencer getting home and there isnt much else. And i gotta tell ya, i am sick of getting yet ANOTHER episode where Spencer is still headed home. Im over it at this point. And the OTT sexual violence which didnt do anything for the story which means its just there to show brutalizing women... this was a hugh let down compared to the others. I wouldn't recommend this one.","rating":"2\/10","date":"6 March 2023"}

I don't understand who anyone is and what they are doing but just doing what Duttons & Co do, kill people and be just plain old unlikeable people! I'm tired of Yellowstone, it's kind of like Lost in that I feel Sheridan is just making everything up as he goes. He's a terrible writer and loves when there is no happiness or peace! I'm so over anything Sheridan. He has too much going on and it shows! What a waste of time & talent! I'm glad 1883 was only one season. Hopefully 1923 will be the same and this will be the last season for Yellowstone. I think everyone is getting tired of the violence just to Have violence! I dislike every character on any of the 3 shows besides Kaycee. Beth & Rip remind me of Bill & Hillary. What a joke this all has become! Everyone says they'd love to have friends like the Duttons, believe me you wouldn't! Non stop drama gets old very fast! Quit before you completely fade away Sheridan! Now that I'm done watching S01 this is truly a pathetic attempt to combine Sons of Anarchy & Legends of the Fall! What is up with all the modern day showering together? The S&M?

It's only been 40 years from 1883 to 1923. So little\nJohn Dutton from 1883 should be somewhere in the mix. Instead we get 78 year old Harrison Ford. Where did he come from? What relation is he? Please, explain all this. Otherwise it doesn't follow the storyline from 1883. The only thing in common is the ranch. This doesn't compare to 1883.I'm gonna say this is one confusing prequel that doesn't follow suit. It seems to be a stand alone series not a prequel.

Helen Mirrens \"Irish accent\" is the worst \"Irish\" accent since Sean Connerys in Darby O'Gill! - (The Englishman playing the Scottish man is as bad). And they didn't bother too much with regards to research. Ireland isn't part of Britain! It was invaded by the British, but always Ireland.It jumps over the phone to different storylines, poorly. It seems that the writer has been bathing too long in the success of Yellowstone and 1883, and just threw this together.Don't think I'll make it past episode 1, 1883 was excellent, this, so far is absolutely terrible!","rating":"1\/10","date":"20 February 2023"}

A woman peeing unaccompanied outside a tent in africa when in those day a pot was standard in everyday life...... With professional hunter to guard the camp from know danger.... Ridiculously stupid.

{"title":"More soap from TS","review":"Once you run out of original ideas, you end up with not enough content to fill the time. They must have paid Mirren and Ford a ton of money to persuade them to film this fluff. The storyline about those two in Africa, then Europe, is just cringe-worthy, like the acting - similar to 1883. The story of the Native American girl showed promise, then devolved into a soap opera, like the rest of the series, only bloodier. It is really hard to keep watching a story without a single likeable character, not the least because none of the characters gets enough screen time to get fleshed out. Of course, for some of them, like the blond British girl, that is a blessing, rather than a curse. It seems Sheridan has a thing for such creatures...","rating":"5\/10","date":"12 March 2023"}
{"title":"What Is This?","review":"Apparently if you watched all the other Yellowstone stuff, this show may be right up your alley. But for those of us who didn't see them, this is really boring. Heated arguments about grazing rights? Yee-haw! Remember Star Wars episode 1 and how that was all about trade disputes? That movie sucked and so does 1923.In addition, that Africa storyline... who the hell runs off with a crazy-eyed woman when they have literally said 50 words to each other? And they get \"engaged\" like 2 days later? Both are broken and bananas. It's not romantic, it's insane. Nobody in their right mind would do this. Granted, I know that neither one is \"in their right mind\", but it's still so over the top to be laughable. And she claims to find his death wish lifestyle \"romantic\", yet even after he explains what he does the first time she encounters wildlife she goes on a diatribe of how it's not romantic, and how dare he expose her to such danger, and she never wants to feel that again, etc. What the heck did you expect? It's freaking Africa you crazy eyed loon! Please let her get eaten by a shark while she's swimming in the ocean or something.And for the love of all that's holy please liven up that nonsense about cattle and sheep.

James and Margaret are replaced with Jacob and Cara. No flash backs to fill in the gaps or reason for character changes. Where on earth did these come from. According to their characters they are in their 60-70's.OMG when will people learn that Harrison Ford can't really act. Everyone has an accent apart from him, even Helen Mirren doing an Irish accent along the line of Tom Cruise in \"Far and Away\". Some people saying Harrison and Helen are perfectly cast OMG seriously. Think you need to get some glasses or hearing aids.So now we have moved from hardened cowboys from 1883 to senior citizens who are totally different from the characters who started the Yellowstone.Jacob surviving 9 bullets in the 1920's from machine gun, having to wait for doctor to arrive, seriously should have let him die in the first episode and save us the laughable story, and placed Cara as the Matriarch, would have been more believable.To think this might be getting a second season but 1883 didn't, whats next 1963.","rating":"5\/10","date":"7 February 2023"}

While i admire mister costner's production values casting and story, giving in to network pressures to just create more and more episodes to keep people coming back - it's just plain stupid. Just like with the walking dead they will milk you and milk you and milk you until there's nothing left but dumb television.Sir, You have the top shows in television. Why on earth must you resort to these parochial high school film class tactics to string people on to another season? It is so unnecessary -people will come back for the story.. The thing is they've been doing that for eight weeks and you could have told the story like you did with 1883. Just tell the story and get the hell out of the way. Don't milk it, don't water it down, don't stretch it out for no reason other than a money grab.Forgive the brief digression, but it's bad enough the networks are allowed to crap all over these artists\" creations with advertising ( In spite of it already being a paid service), but not even crediting directors or actors on most of these streaming services (showing credits in high speed or in a box so small you couldn't read it with a telescope). Everyone from the film crews to musicians - I'm so sick of the way this industry craps on those on whom they depend for their very existence.At least you finally decided to allow yellowstone to end (or at least he's announced he's leaving it according to the media). I fully expect them to milk that for at least another five seasons however being the cash cow that it is.You think this guy would have enough spine to stand up to them. Well count me out i'm done.

Harrison Ford as a rancher just seems like piss poor casting. The safari story doesn't make any sense. Random elephant attack, climbing up a short tree then escaping lions then cars just rolling up out of no where. The woman screaming one second then getting bomfed in the backseat of a car. 8.6...

Possibly one of the most predictable shows I've seen. The narration by Elsa was the only good thing and why I signed in and gave the show a 1 instead of just bypassing the whole thing.The side story with Spencer is just pap for the screen. Cute girl, story doesn't move anything forward. I'm on the last episode now and I am shutting off the television.Now I'm just adding a few sentences to the review to make it long enough.

{"title":"It's Tyler, alright.","review":"This show follows the same narrative of dealing with life and lives the unconditional and brutal way, as has been Sheridans trademark, in my eyes. I have seen it before. In Yellowstone. In 1883. And in Sicario - which I still love, by the way. The brutality is what you get when watching anything from Taylor and that is ok. But what is this using nubile Elsa Dutton as the beholder of wisdom and voiceover for this series? It felt strange in 1883 already, that this girl shared all these thoughts and life experiences owned usually only by people with their whole life behind them.And Harrison Ford is really just a shadow of himself here. I guess his role is a bitter man. But he is just broken, man. Lifeless and tired. And when Elsa turned up with another voiceover, I turned off.","rating":"5\/10","date":"5 January 2023"}
{"title":"The Africa storyline is offputting...","review":"Other than that, when they stick to the western storyline of the Dutton family it's OK, the overly mellow dramatic storyline in Africa with the dumb, rich lady and Spencer is not good... Watching these 2 claw t eachtoher while murdering beautiful animals in their own terrain is a hard pass. Stick to the formula.At least the mellow drama with Elsas storyline was more interesting in terms of it being in America and the historical background of the Native people on the land. There is no chemistry between Spencer and this whiney, rich, entitled woman that threw herself at him and insisted she tag along. Every time they are on screen it's cringe worthy.

{"title":"It's about harsh and cruel people","review":"I understand the initial appeal for these Yellowstone shows but after a while the shine wears off and you realize that there are no redeemable characters and the story, that's not all that engaging to begin with, starts to drag on. 1923 is no different, unfortunately. There are three threads to the story in the episodes I've seen so far: The first is the story of a Dutton and his wife who are in conflict with some local Irish whose sheep keep grazing on the Dutton's land (the GALL!!). The second appears so far to be completely unconnected and is about a poor Native American girl who is being brought up (and abused) in a Catholic school somewhere on the prairie (I think). The third is about an estranged (I think) son of the Duttons from the first story who appears to be trying to make a life for himself in Africa. The acting is fine, the cinematography is movie quality, but the story is just kind of...boring. Not enough that I won't watch it anymore but definitely not appointment TV. I usually turn this on when I can't think of anything else to watch and my wife is busy or something. I think it's been well established that the Duttons are terrible people but so are pretty much all of the characters in these shows, including 1923. Even the Native Americans who you would think would be the heroes, look kind of bad too much of the time. When you boil it down, it's just a bland story about land ownership going back about a couple hundred years and what lengths people will go to preserve it. That would be fine with me if there were at least some interesting or even likeable characters along the way.","rating":"5\/10","date":"31 January 2023"}
{"title":"Happy \"ladies\"","review":"Having watched Yellowstone and 1883 I was eager to continue with 1923.First, it is very confusing to not continue the straight family story line from the two previous series. Now all new names and everyone is an uncle to someone. You basically have no idea who these people are.Then, three main story lines are going on, with no connection to one another. What is the point? You keep on waiting for them to connect somehow, but nope. Which becomes weird in the end. You don't really root for anyone either.The filming and locations are so bad! You clearly see that they aren't outdoors filming. They have build up wooden planks with a blurry image of mountains in the background. As if someone has set up a large back-drop. Surely someone could Photoshop (insert other tool) this better. When they are inside their large house, it looks like a fake set, which it also is of course. When they are on the little tug boat everything looks so fake it's ridiculous.When we were on the last episode me and my partner both realised that this series weren't about horses, cattle, ranching, wild west at all. More of a romantic story you care little about.The last straw for me was when the two prostitutes the Irish guy hires, are soo willing and silly. Should this be considered sensual? Let me laugh. And when Timothy Dalton arrives in the house they sit there half naked? Why wouldn't they get dressed when a stranger walks into the house? And when he makes them brutally abuse each other with a belt it's just too much. First they cried and were sad, then started to like it???? Seriously. Who in the writers team has this idiotic fantasy even. Also, why didn't they just leave the house? Timothy weren't there all the time. Just open the door and walk out.The abuse\/rape scene where two naked actresses removes all stars from this review.This show is filmed through the male eye showing unnecessary explicit abuse to women, both the prostitutes and the native American girls.","rating":"1\/10","date":"19 June 2023"}
{"title":"Sadly ruined in the last 2 episodes!","review":"I do not like Yellowstone because it glorifies horrible characters and makes them the hero's of the show. Beth Dutton needs to shut up and grow up. But 1923 seemed to be different. It had amazingly strong women characters and brought long overdue attention to the mistreatment of Native Americans. It showed the strength of senior citizens with Harrison Ford and Hellen Mirren giving fantastic performances. But in the last 2 episodes it showed almost complete nudity, gratuitous sex, and torture of 2 women which only promotes objectification of women. It was disgusting! My husband and I are both very disappointed in the directors of this show for turning something so promising into utter filth.","rating":"1\/10","date":"2 March 2023"}

Scenery of course is jaw dropping the writing is fantastic maybe they are trying to do to much to fast and are losing the allure that Yellowstone and 1883 captured. Slow down please. I really enjoy everything Taylor Sheridan is putting out and really hope the rate he is working at doesn't jeopardize the storytelling . This is pushing it.

Glorification of paragons that could never exist, nor would given some of the absurd contexts the characters are thrust in.It's not complete garbage, but I do tire of the cheapness of the attempt to bring back some credulity and longing for a non-existent persona.There is cognizance in the plot of moments and contexts which probably did occur and were disgusting to behold, but they are not the focus of the series, rather some justification of why it should be allowed in the modern era.","rating":"5\/10","date":"29 December 2022"}
{"title":"What a letdown!","review":"Beautifully filmed with legendary lead actors, the first couple of episodes looked promising. Then it started to get absurd. The sneering, cartoon bad guys, the fetishized violence, and the awful accents made it almost unwatchable.Jerome Flynn does his best as a one-dimensional baddie with an unintelligible accent. Is he Irish? Is he Scottish? Who knows or cares? Timothy Dalton is fun to watch as the evil businessman until they decide to make him pervy instead of just a central casting Snidely Whiplash villain. Whose idea was it to hire a Shakespearean actor and have him watch prozzies whip each other with a belt? These two outstanding actors are completely wasted, but still eminently watchable in poorly written parts.What is the fascination with people beating one another? Nuns don't just rap knuckles, they beat them until they bleed or do nasty things to their young charges. Then a sadistic priest has a go. One nun gets a ferocious beating, gives a beating, gets another beating, and eventually gets murdered. We have to wait until the next season to find out what the Catholic school had to do with anything because they never link it to the Dutton family.Let's talk about the vigilante priests. More ferocious beatings? By priests? Since when did priests get all macho? We get it. Hollywood doesn't like religion, Catholics in particular. Low hanging fruit, people.The accents are a farce, even Helen Mirren's, but her acting bails her out. Not so the girl who plays Alex. Her main purpose is to be blonde and spout perky gibberish in a fake English accent. And she's a countess. Of course she is. It's tragic that there are no actresses in England. They had to find a California girl shallow enough to play such a twinkie.This series had so many possibilities but just went wrong in so many ways.","rating":"2\/10","date":"6 March 2023"}
{"title":"No wonder the 20's dragged","review":"Hoping that this series was going to be as good as 1883 and Yellowstone unfortunately this was not the case. Looks good on paper with an excellent cast and the backstory to the Dutton dynasty however, after 6 episodes I still don't know where the series is going. The most interesting part of the story so far appears to be behind the Rainwater Indian side. The rest of the story about cattle barons vs sheepherders is so predictable with the usual English ? Even the retuning son from Africa complete with bride, who appear to get from place to place no problem at all, complete with a full exotic wardrobe. Not impressed at all.","rating":"5\/10","date":"14 February 2023"}
{"title":"Not worth the watch\uf8ff\u00fc\u00f2\u00ee","review":"Before I start, I absolut love Harrison Ford and Helen Mirren, fabulous actors, but no not in this. They both plod along like they're in pantomime, no passion in the acting, and as for the rest of the cast, nah not a lot to say, OK but not great. Jerome flynn, to say his role and acting is mediocre compared to his fabulous loveble rogue character in Game of thrones, in that he was amazing, in this very forgettable. Brandon sklenor should be the next he man or tarzan. So many life and death encounters in such a short period, fighting leopards lions and elephants, lifting cars back onto the road, surviving an overturned boat and throwing royalty over board on a cruise ship, really are you serious!!! Julie schaepfer, lovely girl, but forgettable. But most cringing if all is the accents, I believe Americans don't see the issue but when your frome Europe especially Ireland and Scotland its like listening to someone scrape fingernails down a chalkboard, omg terrible. Jerones Scottish accent, Helens irish accent, Jennifer's irish accent ( sister mary) is diabolical and offensive to the eardrums to listen too. I cannot believe they couldn't find an Irish and Scottish actors to play these parts. If you cant do it, DONT!!!! I am totally a western fan, but I won't watch anymore, it could never come back from this atrocity so for me so I'll give the rest a miss.It's no Yellowstone, sometimes the origionals are best left to be enjoyed, you can only get so much milk from a cows udder, Taylor Sheridan, move on buddy, yellowstone is a 10 out of 10\uf8ff\u00fc\u00eb\u00e5\uf8ff\u00fc\u00eb\u00e5\uf8ff\u00fc\u00eb\u00e8\uf8ff\u00fc\u00eb\u00e8","rating":"5\/10","date":"21 April 2023"}

I did not like Helen being cast but she is doing well although her age is off for having a 20 year old child. I would rather see one story at a time that are related. I hope they edit the other episodes so they fit better together. It would be better to show one story at a time.

They were also poorly acted by them as well. I wish they would have been better a making a well rounded and talented cast. It pales in comparison to Miran and Ford. The villains were pure stereotype. They make the time period seem to be from 50 years prior and fail to properly consider the modern world and judicial system in their ranch wars. People kill each other, steal cattle, kidnap, beat all the time and no law is considered or used and for no real reason.","rating":"5\/10","date":"25 March 2023"}

What is the point of the African hunting storyline - it's absolutely gross to see endangered wildlife killed for no reason - especially when it's misinformed and doesn't fit into the narrative's whatsoever. Also who cares about Irish settlers - nobody. This series isn't worth watching anymore Ep 3 is enough to stop continuing.Taylor Sheridan is a sellout and it's impacting his writing ability.

{"title":"ohhh no","review":"Just because you can, you shouldn'tSicario was just a great movie, as is. Simply continuing in the second part wasn't just good enough .. The result speaks for itself. Same thing with this 1923.... Continuing the story from 1883 wasn't just good, had to mix Kenya, or that party with the nonsense nuon, totally meaningless.I stopped watching after the first 15 mins, because H. Ford's performance was just doul. He should retire for good. Helen Mirren thinks she is playing Queen Elizabeth. The rest, with their forced fake accent.... Storyline is just off, Sheridan should have continued 1883 instead of this.","rating":"1\/10","date":"1 January 2023"}
{"title":"Not,Impressed","review":"Taylor Sheridan cannot write himself out of a paper bag. There is nothing about the first episode that even remotely entices you to look forqard to episode 2. Sheridan showed us in his groaner 1883, he doesn't know diddly crap about entertainment. There doesn't seem to be any sort of storyline anywhere to be seen. The subtitle says it's a Yellowstone origin story but there a total absence of expository matetial to guide the viewer on who is who and how the characters presented lead up to those in the Yellowstone series. This was a major shortfall of 1883 too. One would make better use of one's time watching 50 Shades of something.","rating":"1\/10","date":"19 December 2022"}
{"title":"Bizarre just to be bizarre","review":"Disjointed, convoluted and overly violent for no purpose. No point in watching! Done wasting time on it. 1883 was much much much better. This is just a commercial piece to cash in on the Yellowstone's popularity. Big name talent of Helen Mirren and Harrison Ford can't save it. Also, narration by Isabel May is the only connection to 1883 and her accent is truly strange. It is not a recognizable Tennessee accent as portrayed by the writers. No value add to continuing with it in 1923. Africa scenes seem to be an excuse for going to a exotic place to film for the crew and staff. I guess the next series will be 1974 or some such nonsense and have scenes in Antarctica.","rating":"1\/10","date":"16 January 2023"}
{"title":"Worst high rated show this year.","review":"I cannot for the life of me see how this is rated so high. It's so unrealistic and soppy. It's a classic dime store cheap romance novel. Come on all you higher raters! If you like soap operas, this is for you. It's got nothing that follows fact, yet it is disguised as some kind of historical piece. Garbage. Also did not appreciate the slipping in of the right-wing agenda by justifying killing your enemies in the name of right wing land rights \"I'm entitled to my land because I have to protect my family.\" Also the acknowledgement to Native American lifestyle is good and the abuse they suffered from the Christian missionaries was welcome. But then stupid romance was thrown into that bit of the show. Very sad.","rating":"3\/10","date":"13 March 2023"}
{"title":"Totally Confusing !","review":"Nowhere did I find in this 1923 series in it itself or on the IDMB app that explained the connection between 1883 Dutton family of Tim McCraw and Faith Hills characters .Only in the Wikpedia writing of the shows characters, and a website called The Wrap characters does it tell the viewers how 1923 is linked to 1883.Taylor Sheridan has made a HUGE snap poo on leaving out the connection.You,Mr. Sheridan, should of started this Yellowstone saga, with 1882 instead of 2021 or whenever the first episode of Yellowstone was shot. This back and forth only loses viewers in my opinion, depending on what generation they watched first. As usual, Mr. Sheridan's character's profanity usage adds NOTHING to his shows, and loses alot of viewership. Too bad someone or some company doesn't take it on theirselves to do survey that includes asking viewers their like or dislike of the profanity usage and how much should be allowed.Remember, the initial show is shown on the Paramount (regular) cable channel.Personally, no one under 20 should be watching it. Oh yeah! I forgot! That's who Hollywood wants to watch ALL of their shows, the exact age they seek is 18- 35 years old.","rating":"4\/10","date":"4 January 2023"}
{"title":"Such a let down after 1883","review":"1883 was flawles, so I had high hopes for 1923 and Yellowstone. Sadly by episode three my hopes were dashed. I find the jumps from Montana to Africa jarring, and the sub plot of Spencer and Alex's one day romance and proposal unrealistic and contrived. Her accent, whilst probably correct for the time was grating to say the least, her character was vapid and she seemed the least likely person he would be interested in.Montana fared better, but I would have liked a better explanation as to the characters relationship to the characters in 1883, other than that provided by Elsa's narration. The gun fight in episode three was ridiculous, where would a sheep farmer get a machine gun from for heavens sake? Like everyone else I dound Helen Mirrens Irish accent annoying and felt that both she and Harrison Ford were miss cast, as they seemed to old to be running a farm even with help.I'm unsure whether or not I'll make it to season 9 or even start Yellowstone based on this. Still think Taylor Sheridan's 1883 and Tulsa King are both outstanding though. I think 1883 bnefitted from only having one famous actor in it, as I found HF and HM distracted from the realism.","rating":"5\/10","date":"27 August 2023"}

Why has no one in Hollywood learned yet to NEVER NEVER NEVER have an actor fake a Southern accent? It ALWAYS sounds stupid. ALWAYS.And then, to make this moronic character splatter her \"oh I'm soooo profound\" spectacularly failed fake accent across every single episode with her unneeded narration compounds the utter ruination of a coulda been good show.","rating":"2\/10","date":"24 January 2023"}
{"title":"1923: Star Wars meets Queen Elizabeth","review":"This prequel to Yellowstone is an absolute mess made even more unwatchable by contrived and unconnected subplots and the tired acting of Hans Solo and Queen Ellizabeth. In particular H. Ford's performance is so lacking in energy his dialoge sounds disembodied,like it is overdubbed.as an afterthought. He obviously is way to old in real life to bring any belivabilty to his performance as a working cowboy. I noticed that provided him with a real gentle horse to ride in the cattle roundup scenes.Helen Mirren has played so many English matron roles that her performance in 1923 looks like Queen Elizabeth goes Montana on vacation.The main plot is right out of Star Wars the Empire Striikes back. In this version, the sheep play the role of the white uniformed storm troopers with the ranchers defending their cattle against the spread of the Evil Empire of sheep.The subplots offered in Africa with the Big Game hunter and the scenes of brutality and abuse at the Catholic Indian School seem disconnnected from the main plot and are obviously needed to make the boring main plot more interesting.1923 is an example of what happens when artistic creativity meets huge success and lots of money. Sequels and prequels are then required to keep the cash cows feeding on the range and the sheep continuing to pay for it.But I am sure Taylor Sheirdan can find new ways to continure beating a dead horse.","rating":"2\/10","date":"29 December 2022"}

A lot of the storyline like Spencer's love story or Banner's behavior at the court among others are just forced emphasis on trying to create an emotion rather than focusing on the actual story. The storyline for the native Americans was still better than the rest but even there some of the scenes were just provocative instead of relevant or worthy. Overall, this series could have been a movie and it'd have been a lot better to show only yhe relevant stuff in 2.5 hours rather than adding random BS to make it an 8 episode story. Don't watch it if you know the story already.","rating":"5\/10","date":"27 March 2023"}
{"title":"Don't bother","review":"I give this 2 stars just for the gorgeous visuals and attempting to capture underused time periods and settings (like Safari Big Game Hunter Adventure, and cars replacing horses-interesting). I like how Sheridan took the children from 1883 and made them the heroes of this series. There are some stunning blonde women to fawn over. Sadly that's where my praise ends.James Badge Dale as one of the boys was wasted without a single good dialogue scene before he was killed off. Why?Sheridan seems to have a Steven Moffat problem of spreading himself too thin over too many shows, then they all lag in quality (Sherlock and Doctor Who in Moffat's case). Yellowstone was great but Beth has made that show unwatchable for me. The insufferable smug b-h that is smarter than everyone in the room is the only female character Sheridan likes to write. Talk down to Harrison Ford some more, Helen, put him in his place...I'm very sorry for what happened in Catholic boarding schools to Native children, but cranking the cruelty up to 11 does not make good entertainment, it just turns your audience off and turns my stomach. Watch a documentary if wish but this Hollywood depiction of circumstances is laughably bad. The Catholics are 1-dimensional cartoon villains. You couldn't write ONE sympathetic priest or nun, they were just all 100% evil? Lazy and boring. That's not how you explore history, by presenting everything one sided. When a priest is saying the Lord's Prayer as he tries to murder a poor helpless Indian, tells him his people should be wiped from the Earth, then priest is scalped and you're supposed to cheer for that moment-disgusting. Another priest about to kill the Native girl says something so blasphemous I won't even repeat it, that a priest would never say. We get how you view religion, Taylor. Twisted and heavy-handed does not begin to describe this show. I usually don't get \"offended\" but I hope they lose their entire Christian audience, which is a lot of people. Done. I just skimmed the last episode to see where Ford's story goes and I'm treated to a 3 minute (not exaggerating) gratuitous scene of naked prostitutes beating each other for Dalton's pleasure and Dalton's cartoon villain saying \"I'm a businessman. The word 'decent' doesn't apply to me.\" Haha, ok, that's some nuanced writing there. More F-bombs than a David Mamet script, in the 1920s?? And Pillow Talk. Endless scenes of couples lazing around chatting. Ford is watchable but his acting is pretty rusty.For pity's sake, take a screenwriting class, Taylor. Balance out your characters on the good\/evil dial, and pick up the pace. Winging it by your own rules is starting to fall apart. I liked the first few seasons of Yellowstone, Mayor of Kingstown is surprisingly good because of Jeremy Renner, I haven't caught 1883, but 1923 has turned to straight trash (if you can even stomach the evil Catholic child abuse in the first episode). Sheridan takes sadistic pleasure in the suffering of his characters, and the audience.","rating":"2\/10","date":"26 February 2023"}

Should have thought I've a different location for the black sheep wandering brother.As for the other brother he's coming off as a complete nitwit and not realistic of being brought up during war and depression.

{"title":"Selective misery","review":"Beautifully filmed and dressed streets but you would expect that from the type of budget that delivers some big names, albeit well past their heyday.As a series, it's the trend that keeps on giving. And taking.Take some disparate parts of history, focus on only one set of victims over others and emerge with more misrepresentations of the past that further demonizes certain types and institutions.Unfortunately many people get their views on history from this type of exaggerated cherry picked revisionism.It's just another chapter in Hollywood's war on certain people and groups. They always go after the same types.As entertainment it's nothing but torture porn. As a story it's merely Yellowstone with different characters but more, shall we say, identity politicism. Sheridan is the new 'W' King.The famous actors do their job but their prime is well behind them. Better to revisit their earlier material like Prime Suspect and Witness than persevere through this misery.How many more times can Sheridan tell the same story? It's another remake. Aside from that, he really does need to take a good long look at himself. The divisions he and his colleagues are creating is incredibly damaging.Skip this series. Nothing new here.","rating":"5\/10","date":"11 January 2023"}

Because the show features characters that feel real and that series feature finest writing.1923 however is not like that. I already seen enough to say I have no desire to watch more of this \"Prequel\".Calling this a prequel to Yellowstone is a bad idea because it features characters whom have no relations to the main characters in the series.Plus they have a set of characters that I already despise and are one of the reasons I am giving this series a bad review because of them they push me away from ever watching this series. Who allows a priest and nuns to beat a child and threaten harm to them?

{"title":"Potential...","review":"I was excited about another Taylor Sheridan show, but this one falls short of the other ones. First off the show is very disjointed. Too many characters in too many different places. I could not tell you any of the characters names after 5 episodes. The Indian girl's story line seems excessive and unnecessary and I do not see how she will be connected to the Duttons or the Yellowstone. Ford and Mirren imo are not great choices as the leads for the show. I guess Sheridan was trying to recreate the magic he had with Costner, but Kevin owns that role and is absolutely believable as the top dog at the Yellowstone. The show has potential to be a good western show, but the story line has to narrow its focus soon. Otherwise the audience will lose interest trying to connect all of the pieces.","rating":"5\/10","date":"12 January 2023"}
{"title":"A woman being chased runs down a steep hill in a dress and high heels, and trips.","review":"We really, really enjoyed 1883 (gave it a '8'), and anxiously looked forward to this,1923, as the next in the sequence. This series has three key stories, one continues the saga in Montana, one deals with the mistreatment of native Americans, and the third ...in Africa. The first story is quite good (and has the legacy and amazing actors). The second is very compelling. But this last, well, starts strong and quickly goes off the rails. Just terrible. It involves a man who barely survived the horrors of WW1 and is now based in Africa as a hunter of predators who consider humans prey, meets an uppercrust woman from London, in Africa with her family and friends for her wedding to a high brow fianc\u221a\u00a9, she chooses instead to leave her wedding to go live with the hunter in the wilds, is shocked at the challenges he experiences, is randomly saved from predators by a literal cavalry, and even worse the hunter then spontaneously decides to give it all up for her, all within a 72 hour time period. Please. The most trite, unnecessary, and annoying story, and sloppy writing (think Jar Jar Binx in Star Wars, or Willie Scott in Temple of Doom). So many other, better, ways both characters could have evolved. What is really unfortunate is this Africa story completely spoils the enjoyment of the first two stories (you dread the flip from Montana back to Africa), which, by themselves, would be an '8' in our book, this third is a hard zero, and drags the score low.","rating":"2\/10","date":"2 January 2023"}

I LOL'ed when they were looking at the appliances outside of one of the shops and the windows were perfectly sleek and with vinyl lettering slapped on. The building sidings were perfectly laid bricks and the road was even asphalt. Like, come on! They didn't even try to do any amount of set design.

From what I read, the cattle men, and sheep men got along just fine, but the fact that these people thought that all that open range belonged to them somehow, and when it got crowded the tried to exclude smaller ranches, I find the acting terrible, the cast just as bad, and the plot abysmal, not worth the watch, even on a rainy day.","rating":"1\/10","date":"1 January 2023"}

Partially because I haven't gotten attached to her character, or any character for that matter. We are seeing any kind of development in any way. Not really much of it going on in Yellowstone either. It is just western, crowd pleasing television. Characters need time for their developments to be meaningful (I.e. Breaking Bad, Mad Men).

This current series plays like a mixture of all those, complete with the \"Cheesiness\" factor. There is absolutely nothing original about the events in the series. It's like a mix-up of events of that era, but all melded together in a very superficial manner! One sees traces of writing of great authors like Edna Ferber, Ernest Hemingway etc., made palatable for this series. While not as 'King Lear\" like Yellowstone, one can only wonder why he has done nothing original except to draw heavily on much of what has been done before. One suspects that his \"idea bank\" is running a bit low now!","rating":"3\/10","date":"11 January 2023"}

{"title":"Very slow moving and drawn out.","review":"I have just learned that this is just the first season and there is going to be a second one. So, I had a good think about my review in light of this and the final episode of this season and I am changing my review on reflection.I asked myself did I actually enjoy this as much as I initially thought, but, I realised I hadn't. From Jerome Flynn's terrible accent from episode one to the shambolic nonsense the the series meandered to in episode eight I realised I spent a lot of my time being distracted by all the goofs, plot holes and poorly researched errors. Add those to the gratuitous and sanitised violence, the pointless nudity and sex scenes and it is just a hot mess.Episode eight hit the bottom of the barrel. From prostitutes being whipped with a belt to within an inch of their life and yet displaying no injuries, not even stiffness or pain when getting off the bed and whipping her fellow prostitute, why are they even there? They aren't prisoners so why don't they just leave? To the utter stupidity of the final scenes on the luxury line, where did Spencer and Alex even get that money from to get the tickets, let alone a luxury suite and clothing? And as for her former fiance? Was he from the 18th century and he's supposed to be a member of the Royal Family because he has the title Earl of Sussex, or at least I thought he was until the older Arthur was referred to as the Earl of Sussex and then they called Alex the Countess of Sussex, why? She was wasn't married to the younger Arthur and also, having a title doesn't make you a member of the Royal Family. Then there was the duel, oh, bwah haha! Absolute silliness, I actually stopped watching at the point young Arthur was thrown overboard and Spencer was put in the brig.It's just a load of baloney with a big name cast. And let's not forget the biggest distraction, those pearly white teeth on every member of the cast, Teonna, savagely beaten around the face and head time and again and not one chipped, cracked, broken or missing tooth. And for me the most offensive thing was Elizabeth losing her baby and that ridiculous scene of her and Jack behaving like they'll never have anymore children because she suffered one early miscarriage. Awful and completely inaccurate.And now we have another storyline of the illegal interracial couple, introduced right at the end of episode eight. You feel that Taylor Sheridan was given the go ahead for a second season around the time of filming episode five or six and he completely rewrote the script for the remaining episodes to draw things out and add in new and pointless storylines and it shows.Sometimes a writer develops a big ego and thinks everything he creates is pure gold. Sadly for Taylor Sheridan this is nothing more than Iron Pyrite.","rating":"3\/10","date":"26 February 2023"}
{"title":"Changed Pace to Stretch to 2 seasons DISAPPOINTED!","review":"The first 2 or 3 of episodes were well paced and exciting. Then the paced slowed causing 1923 to be very boring and drawn out. I think that is when the creators and the money-men decided to have a second season because of the popularity. I finished the season very disappointed and unappreciated. Each episode moved slower and slower and I became impatient; then frustrated and angry. While 1883 was a beautiful series 1923 is not. The cinematography of 1923 is bland. In 1883 the characters were complex and admirable and exciting. The 1923 characters come across as tired, especially Jacob Dutton, Harrison Ford's character. His ridiculous rejection of automobiles is annoying. The Model T came of the assembly line in 1908, 15 years prior and in fact 1927 the last one rolled off the line. Anyone that has had to rely on horses their only transportation was glad to employ the use of an automobile. He also rejected the use of electricity which is just plain stupid. And Mirren as a pioneer woman is not believable. Jack Dutton's struggle to get Montana is so frustrating I just wanted him to go back to Africa. It was a ploy to stretch the series to two seasons. Ugh! They did get in some Catholic bashing and Irish bashing; troping both bigoted cliches. I think Taylor Sheridan needs to dial back his steroid use; all of his male characters are evil, mean, violent killers and the women are uber moms and fanatically dedicated wives.","rating":"5\/10","date":"20 March 2023"}
{"title":"Taylor Sheridan Self Indulgence","review":"Stellar cast, scenery, costumes and cinematography spoiled by Taylor Sheridan's penchant for writing over the top villains with miraculous multiple escapes, ridiculous love triangles, intermidable sea voyages, sullen handsome heroes who look off in the distance after speaking sophomoric dribble and old patriarchs who recover after being shot nine times without benefit of hospital. Sheridan's anti Irish, anti Catholic is on unapologetic unbridled display as every religious is either a sadist or lesbian. Every native American and Chinese American is the victim of the white man. The devious miner, the crooked judge, the avaracious banker conspire against the stoic rancher. The writing is reminiscent of the B cowboy movies of the 1950s. Subtly and nuance have no place in Sheridan universe.","rating":"5\/10","date":"23 September 2023"}
{"title":"Elsa narrates again?!","review":"I was soooo excited about this show and I'll continue to watch but why on earth are we tortured yet again with the cheesy Elsa narration?! How can you have the most stellar cast and beautiful landscape but feel the need to have her narrate again. She's the reason I couldn't stomach the other show! Helen Mirren is my she-ro and Harrison Ford is a force. I'll change my rating later but for now I'm pissed I have to listen to her narrate again. I'm from the south and her accent is terrible-sounds forced and totally corny. It takes away from the quality of the show and I'm surprised theyre using her again. Bah humbug!","rating":"5\/10","date":"12 January 2023"}
{"title":"Fix these 2 Key Issues in the show, please Part I.","review":"I think 1923 is good but not great. It is definitely not as great as 1883. Two reasons why stand out for me: Spencer and Alex and the young woman in the Catholic school.Spencer and Alex are just not believable as a couple at all. I say this as someone who loves a traditional love stories between a man and a woman. I love a great traditional love story!-however, it works best when it feels earned!. The audience had barely gotten to know Spencer the character before he ran off with Alex (whom we don't know at all! Lol).We NEED to get to know them first, please and thank you.The second reason: Tianna Rainwater.","rating":"1\/10","date":"17 January 2023"}
{"title":"Is this AI written script? (seriously, is it?)","review":"The script for this series is painful - really painful. No development of characters, or setup for the unexpected things that the characters do, leaving plot line inexplicable. Really feels like an AI written dialog and plot line. Examples of way over the top content: hanging 5 sheep farmers out of the blue, new crush\/fiance that can't stop giggling, Snidley Whiplash as the.evil sheep farmer, nonchalance of characters over hangings, nonstop torture scenes in Indian boarding school. All of these elements need to be justified somehow in the script and are definitively not.Very disappointing in script quality and execution.","rating":"3\/10","date":"13 December 2023"}
{"title":"TOO LONG AND DRAWN OUT","review":"Taylor Sheridan should take a page out of Steven KIng's book and don't start a movie or mini series until you finish the whole book or screen play first then you don't leave your viewers hanging waiting for the next Season to come around. I love the adult content especially the tongue in cheek joke of using a former 007 as the bad ( really bad guy) Now having said that. I like the casting , the acting and the writing you can't have a great show with bad writing , I remember once I asked Jonathan Frakes ( who incidentally would be great for this show ) why he never made captain and he looked me in the eye and said BAD WRITING!! NUFF SAID.","rating":"3\/10","date":"2 March 2023"}
{"title":"Lost","review":"Too much time on unrelated subplots that add little or nothing. Taylor Sheridan has a writing pattern that is reminicent of Sons of Anarchy. All his shows are violance, more violance, sex scenes, and more violance. People didn't overuse the f word back then. Both 1883, 1923 are over filled with it when it isn't even necessary. Both are just like SOA in that the\"family\" tribe is always at war with others and packed with violance. Yellowstone was just the same. He learned a lot from Kurt Sutter but it gets really out there and after so much violance it just gets boring. I won't be recommending this nor will I waste my time watching any other of his shows.","rating":"3\/10","date":"20 December 2023"}
{"title":"Disappointing Series","review":"I enjoyed 1883 and loved Yellowstone but couldn't get into this one. It was like watching 3 different shows thinking the story lines would soon merge but so far it didn't happen, at least not in this season. Had to look online at a Dutton Family tree to see how Spencer was related to the Duttons (James and Margaret's son born after Elsa died). The Catholic school\/beating of the Indian student scenes were very hard to watch and how do they fit into this storyline of the Dutton family building empire in Montana? John, Jame's son who was 5 years old in 1883, could be easily missed in this show if you didn't watch it carefully. I thought originally that his son, John Jr., who is called Jack, would be the grandfather of Yellowstone John Dutton but now I'm not sure since most of 1923 is about Spencer Dutton.","rating":"5\/10","date":"10 December 2023"}
{"title":"Can someone tell Harrison Ford it's time to retire ?","review":"Based on the outstanding storytelling, plot and acting of Yellowstone, and considering the greatly appealing cast of 1923, I was thrilled to watch this prequel, or interquel if you will, given they also did another show, 1883 telling the original story of the Dutton's family crossing the wild Wild West...\nAnyway, apart from the great Helen Mirren, the whole show is just a big pile of garbage, mixing up the family guy in Africa (really, Africa, did you actually need to have some family member feeling the need to move that far away from the United States of America?), the entire cast is a joke, and as I state in the title, a very old and ugly Harrison Ford is just doing the minimum to be credited as the front running actor of the show, with like 5 to 10 minutes tops by episode...which is as good as it gets, given I do reiterate that he needs to let go, go away, retire, give his time to charity if he cannot stand not doing anything, living his last years in luxury.","rating":"5\/10","date":"2 March 2023"}
{"title":"Shame on Taylor Sheridan","review":"I have loved all of the Yellowstone franchises but this one is disgusting. Shame on Taylor Sheridan and everyone involved in this series. The senseless portrayal of killing animals with reckless abandonment is unnecessary and tasteless. Grow up and show some responsibility. Just because you're some rich guy who can go kill animals in Africa doesn't mean you should. Nor should you promote it in your highly popular series's. It's beyond disgusting and you have certainly lost this fan over it. There is absolutely no reason on earth to kill an elephant or a lion or a leopard - ever. Shame on you all!","rating":"1\/10","date":"20 January 2023"}
{"title":"Disappointed","review":"Several wildlife deaths in a row. The plot try convince as it all was self-defense, but it doesn't look like that. People come to wildlife lands to kill their habitats and it must look heroic? This is the lowest thing you could've offer to raise interest to the main character.The deaths of several men hanged on the tree as a punishment to let their sheep eat neighbors' grass is also inadequate at all, even for a screen. This series lost sense of limits at all. If you want to show the strong people who protect their inherited land with all the obstacles around it at least make it look like it is a difficult decision for them to take severe measures against their enemies. It looks like they just do kill people by default and then.. h-ha.. go to police with the issue! This show is sucked from a finger despite all the great idea beneath it.","rating":"1\/10","date":"8 January 2023"}
{"title":"Misery and Boredom at Yellowstone Ranch","review":"If you thought Tim McGraw and Faith Hill couldn't act in 1883, Harrison Ford and Helen Mirren's acting in 1923 is so bad it is hard to believe they got paid. Just because they are old doesn't mean they have to act dead!What is the point of living at Yellowstone? You shoot everyone you see and everyone that sees you wants to shoot you! What a god awful boring place to live and kill for.I must say that Spencer's and Teonna's stories are way more interesting than anything going on at Yellowstone. The telegram to Spencer should have told him to stay away and enjoy life, not come back to Yellowstone and be bored and forget how to be an actor once you get there!It's really hard to get through the series once Harrison can't act Ford and Helen boring Mirren come back on screen. Big Yawn on their part of the saga! Only the cast in Spencer and Teonna's story can act.","rating":"1\/10","date":"6 January 2024"}
{"title":"Mostly filler, very slow story progression","review":"Goooood grief!What a massive disappointment.Episode after episode wasted on filler.Yes, yes, we have it... the journey to the US from Africa was indirect and challenging... but come on, the entire tugboat\/capsizing\/rescue at sea was sooooo boring and sooooo farcical. Coming on the back of the ridiculous pile of unread letters episode that served only to avoid explanation of how the recent, urgent letter found its way to them at all. Bull shlt. I cannot remember sticking with a show that makes us groan out loud, we are now fast forwarding past this absolute garbage in the hope that the story will get back on track when they finally, finally get back to the ranch.Yep, it's that unwatchable.","rating":"2\/10","date":"28 February 2024"}
{"title":"Anyone who liked this show is incredibly ignorant.","review":"The show danced around so often that following any dialog was near impossible. It went from American Indians to a ranch to Africa and back again. Then, the Indians didn't appear again for many episodes.We see multitudes of women wanting to mary and none coming to fruition. Ford gets shot (they say 5 times) and somehow survives. Additionaly Spencer and his lover seem to survive a capsized boat. And we are so brainwashed about who is pregnant and who isn't.I couldn't be less disappointed.This show is a thumbs down!Taylor Sheridan should be ashamed. And I hope that Harrison and Helen are as well!What a joke!","rating":"3\/10","date":"29 September 2023"}
