{"title":"Picard is back","review":"Star Trek: Picard was much better than I expected. Of all the characters throughout the Star Trek franchise, Picard would definitely be on the Mount Rushmore of most beloved characters so Trekkers were worried about ruining the legacy of the character. I know some people didn't enjoy the first 2 seasons that much, most did but some did not. Almost everyone liked the third season because of the nostalgia of all The Next Generation characters reunited. I actually really liked all three seasons. Patrick Stewart doesn't miss a beat as an aging Picard and the show has a lot of solid supporting characters to make the show that much better. Definitely would recommend to any Trekkers out there or just sci-fi fans in general.","rating":"8\/10","date":"8 March 2024"}
{"title":"Thought it was pretty good","review":"I have to start by saying I wasn't the biggest Star Trek fan growing up. I wasn't born when the original came out and was like 7 when The Next Generation was on. I would watch episodes of both here and there but I don't remember much at all about those shows. Then JJ Abrams rebooted the franchise in 2010 and I became a huge fan. I really enjoyed all 3 of those movies. I know some didn't because they compared them to the shows but I didn't. I just enjoyed them as a first time Star Trek viewer. The first series I watched was Star Trek: Strange New Worlds and liked that too. I finally gave Picard a chance recently and liked it so much that I blew through all 3 seasons. So, now I consider myself a Star Trek fan. If you're a fan of Star Trek or starting out like me you should watch this because you'll like it either way.","rating":"8\/10","date":"8 March 2024"}
{"title":"In 3rd season they finally got it right","review":"The first season has been mediocre. I didn\u00b4t expect much and had limited fun. The 2nd season was just so terrible that I refuse to write about it.But in the 3rd season they finally got the twist and deliver what all fans of Star Trek and especially TNG have been waiting for! This finally feels like Star Trek after decades of boredom and stupidity. We finally meet again with all the great characters that we all missed. Even characters like Rafi who has been a real pain in the *ss in the 1st and 2nd season developes nicely and isn\u00b4t so overacted as before. It really feels like in times of Rick Berman and Michael Piller. Thanks!","rating":"9\/10","date":"4 March 2023"}
{"title":"Incredible turn around, season 3 is amazing!","review":"Season 1 was okay not bad but not great. Had its moments mainly involving... Don't want to spoil it..\nSeason 2 was a direct sequel to 1 in story but went horribly wrong and for the first time ever I just couldn't be bothered to watch the last episode, it was that bad. I even managed to finish season 4 of Discovery, that's how die hard a trekkie I am lol.But season 3 is just genius and classic star trek from the start.Episodes 3 and 4 especially blow me away.Being Jonathan Frakes back as a director and actor just bring that magic the show was missing.The story, the cast, the sets, music, effects, acting, humour, it has it all just down to perfection.Watch them all of you are a die hard fan only, or just watch seaaon 3, you'll pick things up.If they can keep this up for the rest of the season I will be a very happy trekkie.Live long and prosper my friends.","rating":"9\/10","date":"9 March 2023"}
{"title":"Star trek is back!","review":"Season one and especially two have been pretty disappointing, but season 3 is completely different. Especially with episode 4. This is now the first proper Star Trek sine Voyager ended in 2001. I'm thankful that someone approved the script for season 3. Yes it has its flaws, but damn it this is real Star Trek - something I've sorely missed. Jonathan Frakes shows how good he is as a director again. Several scenes reminded me of First Contact.I sincerely hope that season 3 is successful enough that we will get more Star Trek like it. This is very corny, but I really feel the world is a better place with Star Trek - as long as they stick to a positive and optimistic message!","rating":"10\/10","date":"10 March 2023"}
{"title":"Amazing and emotionally inspiring!","review":"Having watched all the Star Trek series since they first came out in the '60s, and all the movies many times I was totally surprised by this series! It is amazing! All of the characters are superbly performed, and convey deep emotion with authenticity. Each of the episodes portray a parallel to normal life challenges, and convey the feelings with genuine depth. Some of the dialogue is truly inspiring, and causes a self-examining person to collate their own feelings with the character. It was deeply moving, and I highly recommend it to anyone even if they are not a science fiction fan. This will stimulate your heart and mind in a most entertaining way!","rating":"10\/10","date":"13 January 2024"}
{"title":"Unforgivable Misrepresentation: The Butchering of the Borg Concept","review":"The portrayal of the Borg in the show is disappointing as it goes against their historical depiction. Instead of their usual focus on assimilation, the show has depicted them as being solely focused on pointless annihilation. This depiction is an insult to the history, concept, and future of the Borg. It is difficult to understand why the Borg would engage in such indiscriminate killing of non-assimilated individuals. Furthermore, the portrayal of the Borg queen as less than regal is inconsistent with her established character. This gross injustice oversimplifies the concept, turning the Borg into pure villains with no nuance. A good villain should have shades of gray, which is lost in this portrayal. The show's approach ultimately does a disservice to the complexity of the Borg and reduces them to a simplistic good versus evil trope.","rating":"","date":"22 April 2023"}

{"title":"Aged like the finnest of wines!","review":"This is the best TV show in all of the Star Trek universe. By itself, its a good Sci-Fi. But its not by itself. It has history. And what a way to bring it all together!I need to say I'm not a 'Star Trek Nerd'. Growing up, it was what 'Dads' were into. It was OK, even pretty good, but not my generation. Frankly I enjoyed Voyager more because it was the least like Star Trek. Voyager was my introduction to the franchise.So when someone said that Seven was a Captain, I really had to see for myself. Needless to say my mind was blown when I seen her take control of a Borg Cube!They did a fantastic job bring the band back together!Season 1 8\/10\nWhat a great way to start. The plot is quite relevant to the news were having this last past year and a half. Everyone is talking about AI. AI is everywhere, and it would be weird if Star Trek did not have a spin of it too. All in all, I liked what they did with this! I was hooked and the binge watching was in full force!Season 2 5\/10\nIts good where its good but bad where it is bad. Anytime you introduce time travel, nothing matters. The only thing that matters is the start and the end. Everything in the middle can be twisted to all degrees in so many ways and still come to the same conclusion. But to be fair, its a concept that does deserve the attempts to create stories with. I just think they fall short most of the time. In this case, you just roll with it, it does start and ends well.But that's not the bad. Its like were watching the draft of Season 2 that did not get polished up. There are countless little things that just don't fit well as a good story. I do get at time you have to do something just to move the story along, but this season had dozen of such moments.The good news, it attempts to go into Jean Luc past and uncover some physiological traumas. But I felt they did some dragging and they never really showed or sold me what did actually happen to his mom. Between this and the amount of screen time Rios got in his side story, and how it ended, I think they could have made this season 7 or 8 shows instead of 10 and been better for it.Season 3 9\/10\nNow were cooking with dilithium! The Stage is set, the crew is back together, and we have yet another save the Federation against all odds plot, and they have to do it with the old ship. Nostalgia is all over this season! This one is for the Boomers!All 3 seasons have that 'end of the story' feel. What I mean is it does not drag out for season after season waiting for the big moment. It starts big and stays big. Its going to be hard to see how they can keep pushing big ideas, but I have little worries about the next couple of seasons. Star Trek Picard is pushing hard at being the best Star Trek has ever made!All in all when you go back to rewatch it, just skip Season 2 and its a great!Now the 4th season is not out yet and I have some speculations.(edit - found out there is no season 4 but Ill leave my thoughts about it as is.)First, I Jean Luc Picard is aging. All the respects for the legacy he has left behind. Truly legendary in the entirety of TV\/Movies. Everyone knows who he is, Star Trek nerd or not. What a guy, and what a roll did he play! Well done!But I have noticed his vitality diminishing from season 1 to 3. His time is limited and I can tell he is trying to pass his baton to the next. I think that's part of the reason for this show. To leave on a good note. But I fear, and what might be best for season 4 is for him to 'slow down' and not be the main character. Put the emphasis on his son, and of course Seven. Jean should be a guest star to tie up some story bits.His time is near, and I hope its well planned out where he has his final episode while he still has the vitality to leave the last impression to the world before hes gone. I don't want to see him become that frail old man. He earned his time here on earth, he had a good go, and I want to remember him for what and who he is. Not the dying guy. Please don't push him past his abilities. Yet, I hope hes still a part of this in some way for some time yet.But who knows what full body scans\/AI CGI that will exist long after his time? Who knows, maybe a digital Jean Luc Picard will remain and be in 1000's more TV and movies for the next 100 years?Maybe in some way, Jean Luc Picard will be the first immortalized human in our history whom will live long and prosper in the hearts and minds of all future Star Trek fans for Generations to come!","rating":"8\/10","date":"23 February 2024"}
{"title":"How to FIX Season Two","review":"How to fix Picard, Season Two: Picard DREAMED IT ALL.Seriously, the entire season needs to be obliterated. Instead of a cohesive plot line, this season was a series of random vignettes, blatant political statements, and weak resolutions to conflict. Though I agree with their politics, they overwhelmed the story to the point of distraction. And what about the BUTTERFLY EFFECT, which they tossed aside when they got to Los Angeles?WHAT ABOUT Q-the most intriguing part of the Season Two teaser trailers? He was on the screen for about five minutes total. WHAT A WASTE of an iconic and classic villain. His story was incidental.And it took all of La Sirena's power to jumpstart the Borg Queen-AT THE COST OF ELNOR'S LIFE-but she gained enough power to build a Borg army with an annoying musical performance, smashing a window, and draining the batteries of a dozen old cars?!And seriously, in 400 years, the best treatment option for a suicidal woman will be to lock her up?","rating":"6\/10","date":"7 May 2022"}
{"title":"Complete lack of respect for anything Star Trek","review":"Patrick Steward is a gifted actor, but thinking anything other falls under the halo effect. With the creative control he had, he added to the mess of all the newer Star Treks, adding his own flavour or something already unique by its own right. All the creative control, production and cast did not seem to understand and comprehend what made Star Trek so great. Star Trek was never about a post-apocalyptic future, where humanity has been corrupted and brought to its lowest point. Star Trek was always unique, in that, it always showed the best humanity has to offer and how this human beings occasionally have stave off corruption and discrimination. Much of Star Trek is humans solving external problems. This is for numerous literary reasons but for on, it enables the viewer to objectively observe the moral dilemmas involved and, if we want, we can relate this to our own problems(in reality). This has always been a strong point in Star Trek.Star Trek Picard, and STD, has turned this idea upside down. They've focused on one character(Picard in this case) and made any objective moral dilemma non-existent. In Picard, everything is personal now. Every situation is emotional and in your face. There is no time to reflect, and what's worse, the whole method of story-telling and even the foundational principles of Star Trek has become altered. It's become exactly like all the other post apocalyptic sci-fi's, where survival is the main goal and anything else is secondary. Apart from this view, the show makes no sense even if it was not Star Trek. There are so many plot holes, inconsistencies with the story, no character development and in-your-face exposition, it makes watching Picard an absolute chore.Funnily enough, even though it's the first Star Trek(eh) to name it's show about one character, it really isn't about Picard, at all. Its really about a character called Soji. Picard seems to be portrayed as someone who was egotistical. However, he was never like this in TNG. There are tons of continuity problems and some things just don't make any sense. Swearing being one of them. One of the main themes I picked up from Picard, and STD, is the continual belittlement of males in order to strengthen female characters. Picard will continually get shouted at, sworn at and play minor roles. He has very little impact on the story, is always second guessing himself(or someone else is) and his character seems more of a filler character than anything else.Star Trek has always had social commentary, but Picard, and STD, type of story telling is poor and sexist. It's gone too far, but not because the topics are controversial but because the writers for the show are terrible. Picard is now overtly sexist with sexist commentary and obvious agendas. Understandably, the previous series always had some underlining sexism, because it was still made by people that lived in discriminating times, but this reduced as more Star Trek was released. However, Picard and STD, has, literally, increased and made sexism overtly apparent. Women characters have taken charge in the newer Star Trek at the expense of males. The problem with this 1: it's done incredible poorly, 2: it seems to run on the incorrect assumption that Star Trek fans are male chauvinists 3: because of 2 males are continually belittled. I honestly don't care if a crew is all female, hell, my favourite captain of all time is Captain Janeway, but everything put together makes this show an insult to a Star Trek fan or anyone who does not like the method in which they're telling their saga.Every conceivable part of what made the original Star Treks great has now been distorted and disfigured. Star Trek is now edgy, resentful, in your face, angry and spiteful. Self reflection does not exist anymore. Conversing about moral dilemmas went does the toilet. I recommend no one watch this trash if they ever liked the previous series. If you're looking for food-for-thought look at the previous Star Treks or the Orville.","rating":"1\/10","date":"7 December 2021"}

{"title":"Not aging well","review":"I suppose I am like many, kind of a nostalgic completist. I watch the new Star Trek show hoping to feel some of the pleasure I felt watcing them for the first time, in my own relative youth. I was in my mid-twenties when TNG began and my thirties for Voyager and DS9. Like many of the older fans, my memory of TOS was reruns, cartoons and movies.Putting aside nostalgia, one of the reasons I considered Picard to be my favourite Enterprise captain was the interesting combination of rationality and emotion and of reserve and physicality. Almost tied was Sisko, who brought together such qualities in a different but equally impressive way.Nostalgia is fine and I enjoy looking back. I appreciate some of the changes that have come over the years with experience and maturity. But I know that my prime has passed and the decline accelerates each year.Which takes us to Star Trek: Picard. I watch this not because I think it to be the equal of its predecessor. I watch it for the sake of nostalgia. Patrick Stewart is a shadow of his former self, his physicality shrunken and his voice that of an elderly man. But my memory of the original endears him to me. Unfortunately, his character seems to have changed. Not just far more emotional but also a person who prizes his own personal desires above his duty. Many of the themes that made Star Trek so enjoyable have disappeared.","rating":"6\/10","date":"24 February 2023"}

Nothing could be a more apt description of Jean-Luc Picard in this show. If we're honest with ourselves we realize the only reason we watched this show was to see Jean-Luc back in action.

Season 3 is everything I would want: well written, great character development, good pacing and action, adequate amounts of fan service without going overboard- it's fun and great.The standouts to me are the interactions between Picard and Riker. It's great to see that chemistry once again. Worf is the best he's ever been. Beverly is fantastic as well- especially the scenes between her and Picard.I have to say, so far, the performances of the TNG cast is the best I've seen from them. They really put in their all.The only thing that saddens me is that there are no plans to keep going after Season 3. I would totally stick around for more seasons of this.

{"title":"The resplendent culmination of a beloved universe and cherished characters","review":"I can't hide the fact that I'm a huge Trek fan. Imperfect as the franchise has sometimes been since its inception (and occasionally outright problematic in retrospect), it's also been terrifically entertaining at every turn, and filled with fabulous variety. Awe-inspiring visuals, thrilling action, truly great acting (and, okay, some questionable acting), fun comedy, and increasingly rich, deeply compelling storytelling have been the hallmarks of 'Star Trek' from Day One, not to mention a yearning to inspire with progressive ideals, dreams of what could be, and substantial themes that are very relevant to real life. When I learned that Sir Patrick Stewart was participating in a brand new series, reprising Jean-Luc Picard, I knew I would eventually have to watch. As soon as I sat down to do so, I was immediately swept away. I can't necessarily speak to the experience for those who aren't already Trekkies, though given the new series' very high quality I can only trust that folks among the general audience would enjoy it, too. What I can say is that 'Picard' represents everything we've loved about Gene Roddenberry's flagship creation for the past fifty-plus years, and it wouldn't be unreasonable to argue it could be the best entry in the franchise to date.Though they are few and ultimately minor, it's worthwhile to discuss some issues that are not necessarily abject flaws, but possibly barriers for those who are not already enamored of this universe, and marginal blemishes that prevent the series from achieving perfection. Chief among these is that in each season it simply feels that the story is just too big to be told within the allotted ten episodes, and that a full, once-typical production schedule of more than twenty episodes, if not multiple seasons, would have been preferable. We get this sense somewhat in the first season, but definitely in the second as a bounty of narrative ideas, which in past series would have been restricted to one per episode, are smashed together into one massive, interconnected weave; the third season, in no small part feeling like one of the most epic, impactful ST stories in the franchise's history, needed more room to breathe. In turn, these tales that are so exciting and absorbing, and these characters that are so beloved - written with great depth, complexity, and personality, and portrayed with equal nuance, range, and gravitas - feel ever so slightly shortchanged. Case in point, it was surprising to me how some supporting characters are introduced as seeming integral figures of the series, only to later vanish. Moreover, instances of outright fan service are gratifying in some measure, yet there are facets that feel less like judicious storytelling, and more like a direct appeal to nostalgia and emotion. And while I appreciate that these are not matters exclusive to 'Star Trek' but common to all television writing, the neatness with which some plot elements are resolved, or the \"wishful thinking\" logic of science fiction that others require, do test the limits of our suspension of disbelief every now and again.Be all that as it may, when you get down to it 'Picard' is nothing less than a stupendous success, and it's even better than I ever could have hoped. It's true that some aspects are included with pointedly draw from previously established canon, and episodes of past series - but then, given the focus on one of the most famous figures in Starfleet history, that's rather to be expected. Even more to the point, there is no inclusion or nod which is not meaningful. It's readily evident how much care and intelligence the writers were pouring into this new creation, and all this is also tied into how each season more or less focuses on different parts of who Jean-Luc is. I think the overarching theme for each is a matter of individual perspective, and we can toss around words like redemption, legacy, reflection, remembrance, and so on; one way or another, what it comes down to is that there is significant focus on hearty drama here, and introspection, and rumination. We still get everything we want out of 'Star Trek,' including both action (possibly the most violent and thrilling in the franchise to date) and humor (some downright silliness, but mostly fun bits borne of warmth, camaraderie, and tremendous wit), but all told much of the weight here is carried by ponderous themes and story ideas, dour concepts, dark topics, and a somber tone. These, too, we've seen in Trek before, sometimes in television and definitely in the full-length feature films, but it seems to me that as 'Picard' adopts a more serious, realistic tenor, shedding much of the bright hues and theatricality of prior iterations, the heavier portions of the storytelling are more pronounced this time around.All this is further bolstered by the very best of modern production values, for everything here is top-notch. While practical effects and tangible creations will always be preferred, with rare exceptions my personal opinion is that the computer-generated imagery in these thirty episodes is the best I've ever seen, and as believable as digital wizardry could be. The violence is more visceral, including blood and gore; the scripts do not shy away from profanity that has been decisively absent heretofore. The narrative trades in ideas that we can relate to in real life, for better and for worse, and ports them to a massive futuristic universe with characters that we wish we could call friends and family. Informed by past contributions but not beholden to them, everyone operating behind the scenes turned in superb, wonderfully sharp work: fantastic sets, costume design, hair, makeup, props, and weapons, let alone stellar cinematography, editing, and direction. Even Jeff Russo's score, taking cues from other 'Star Trek' fare,' composed new themes that are all his own, and which lend to the feel of this series that is both sprawling, cinematic, and adventurous, but also intimate, thoughtful, and sincere. And as much as all involved deserve congratulations for all their terrific labor, including marvelously shrewd writing, the show plainly could not have accomplished all it did if not for the very best of casts. It's well established that the actors of 'The next generation' - Stewart, Frakes, McFadden, Spiner, Burton, Sirtis, Dorn - have such a strong rapport that for all intents and purposes they are, truly, a family, even off-screen. That readily comes across on-screen, too, as much because of the players as for the writing; to my pleasure, the same vibes extend to everyone else. I could not be more pleased with just how effortlessly Orla Brady, Evan Evagora, Santiago Cabrera, Alison Pill, and especially Jeri Ryan and Michelle Hurd have fit into the big picture, and I'm only remiss, once again, that they all didn't get even more time together. From one to the next all embody their characters with impeccable fidelity, making it easy for us as viewers to forget that in reality there's a separation between part and player.As much as I've loved every previous 'Star Trek' series (and movie - yes, even the fifth one), it seems evident to me that everyone participating in 'Picard' went above and beyond to make it the very best it could be. There are characters appearing here that irrefutably receive better treatment than they have at any point in the past; it's hard to imagine that anyone appearing on-camera could some day look back on their careers and not say that this was one of the best projects they ever took on. It may be solemn and grim, but it's not without its lighthearted moments, and from top to bottom the purpose is true and heartfelt and oh so earnest. Since the original series premiered Trek has had its ups and downs, including portions of 'Voyager' and 'Enterprise,' some silver screen flicks that were weaker than others, and some story ideas that were ill-considered and haven't aged well. At its best, however, there is nothing else like it in the world, and I'm overjoyed that watching this new series feels like a long-awaited homecoming. The feelings that 'Picard' elicits cannot be denied. I suppose it bears repeating that while Trekkies will be on board without hesitation, esteem may vary among general audiences; again, however, the sum total is so brilliant and engrossing that I think most anyone who is open to sci-fi will really enjoy themselves. For my money 'Star Trek: Picard' is nothing less than exemplary, and I'm happy to give it my very highest, heartiest, and most enthusiastic recommendation. Bravo!","rating":"9\/10","date":"18 February 2024"}
{"title":"Season 2: Lazy. Season 3: Excellent","review":"Season 2 Review\nI really want to like Picard, I really do. But the show keeps annoying me with the lazy writing. I am half way through season 2 and have to write this review just to rant about my grievances.So Picard and gang get sent to an alternative timeline by Q, where the Federation is a xenophobic fascist empire. So far, so \"mirror, mirror\". Picard and gang decide to travel back in time (like Star Trek 4) to set things right.This could work as a story. It SHOULD work as a story. But there are so many dumb decision and nonsensical story elements, that I keep having to shout at my TV.Upon arriving in the new timeline, Picard and friends are arguably the most powerful people in their society (president, general, head of secret police, head of alien experimentation, fleet captain). They manage to throw this advantage away within the space of minutes.Upon arriving in 2024, they crash in spectacular fashion near Picard's abandoned vineyard in France. No-one sees this or comes to investigate. How uninhabited do the writers think France is?Afterwards, the ship has power for transporters and cloaking device, but not internal heating? Really?!?!?!They transport into major cities in broad daylight repeatedly, yet no one sees them except a small child.The failure of their communicators over long distances in this period (maybe I missed why this happens) is continuously used to prevent vital information being passed between characters. Yet no one thinks to buy a mobile phone, or hack the mobile phone network with their communicators (yet, they can hack police computers in seconds, by hand).No one thinks to replicate any money or ID.Seven can drive a car, but only apparently with her foot flat on the floor, thus once again throwing away their advantage in seconds for the writers to lazily get a car chase sequence into the story.They kill people without any sign of remorse. And yet when Elnor dies, the writers try to tell the audience how tragic this is. If you treat the taking of life so casually, don't expect the audience to feel anything when a main character dies.Picard teleports to coordinates without any idea where it will take him. Surely you would look up the location on a map before going?And on and on it goes...a decent premise pissed away by lazy writing. It is unnecessary and insulting to the audience. Please make it better.Season 3 Review\nClearly the show-runners listened to me ;-)\nAlmost all of the new characters have been jettisoned (alas not literally) and the plot is interesting, the stakes feel real and high, and the dialogue is on point.I thoroughly enjoyed season 3 - it was everything that Picard should have been from the start!","rating":"7\/10","date":"26 May 2022"}

{"title":"Finally!","review":"After 30 years of torturing with some half-baked experiments the real Star Trek emerged! No-one, literally no-one is able to replace iconic Picard and his crew. Finally, in the third season they've gathered all of them (including Seven of Nine from Janeway's ship) in an big adventure across galaxies. Fine story and same old feeling of sense and wisdom which was adorned in 90s show are here again, including magical music and blue \"star trek\" fonts (ending credits of the 3rd season). That and those crew is legandary and timeless. Hope they will continue in these star trek for many more episodes.","rating":"9\/10","date":"13 April 2023"}
{"title":"Season 3- INCREDIBLE","review":"Having not watched Star Trek for a good few years I had lost the enchantment it once held in my teenage years. I'm talking some high-key obsession level enchantment here. ;)I was a huge fan of everything space, federation, phasers, borg cubes and differing species but ultimately what I loved the most was the characters and all of their interactions with one another.Seasons 1\/2- I felt missed this, obviously I enjoyed being back in the world however it didn't reignite my love.And, this is where season 3 threw us a case of budweiser and forced us to hold the beer because WOW!It was everything I could have hoped it to be.","rating":"10\/10","date":"15 November 2023"}
{"title":"Season 3 is what the fans wanted from the start!","review":"Well after the disappointing first 2 seasons of Picard, they finally caved in and gave the fans what they desired after all these years... the STNG crew is back and working together. Absolutely brilliant season and i'm so sorry that the first 2 seasons were so awful that many might not tune in to watch this gem.If you're an STNG fan, do yourself a favour and watch the third season of Picard. You won't regret it. I'm up to episode 9 and can't wait for the finale!!! I can't say the same for most shows these days.CBS, please give us more of the same.. put Jean-Luc in charge of an armada in season 4 and watch the subscriptions skyrocket.

Moreover it is insanely dumbed down, with so much repetition and explanation, rather than letting script and dialogue tell the story subtly. Frankly it is also an outright rip-off of Expanse.","rating":"","date":"27 January 2020"}
{"title":"WTH the Borg AGAIN!!!!?????","review":"I have enjoyed this show, even tho not Star Trek's best effort. However, I just watched episode 9 and all I can say is SERIOUSLY!!?? Wth happened with the writers? Season 2 ended with Jurati becoming the Borg Queen and helping save earth and with the possibility of joining Starfleet. Now they are the bad guys again? The first 8 episodes we thought the enemy was the Changlings. I mean I love a good twist but this is stupid. What the hell happened after Jurati\/Queen Borg saved the day? Why are they enemies again? Maybe they will answer these questions in last episode, but I doubt it. Also, I love Data, but come on he's died twice already.","rating":"6\/10","date":"14 April 2023"}
{"title":"If you're a TNG fan - this is for you!","review":"What can I say? I'm a huge Star Trek fan, and I loved TNG so much. This is the closure we never expected we'd get.The show is innovative, I was very surprised by how they took these characters and universe and seamleslly brought it all up to speed to match today's world: a faster rhythm, great image, dynamic and engaging plots. Also great new characters like Raffi, Laris, Elnor, Chris, and more.I think more than anything, the reason why I watched it in the first place and why I'd rewatch it forever are the feelings. If you've watched TNG you'll know these characters inside out - seeing them again now, so much older but still being them, is such a powerful thing that every single interaction will make your heart beat faster and give you goosebumps. This show will live in my heart forever <3The closure TNG, and all us fans, deserved.","rating":"10\/10","date":"14 January 2024"}

{"title":"So the 2010s Star Trek movies are cannon...","review":"Like the title says - Chris Pine is the official Captain Kirk. It is cemented into Trek legacy by acknowledging the destruction of Romulus as cannon. Shatner and Nimoy's Kirk and Spock were wiped out of reality via time travel in that terrible Star Trek movie. Not only was the original trek completely erased from cannon, but now Picard never had a brother, a nephew, and his mother died young rather than as an old lady as shown in the TNG era.Q is dead, the borg were neutered and made into a joke, Guinan was made into a joke, 7 of 9 is an emotional mess of rage, the Federation is small and petty and just when you thought Star Trek Discovery was the epitome of anti-trek... in comes Picard to destroy the foundation that made the brand so appealing.I advise all to skip seasons 1 and 2 and try season 3 as a stand-alone this month (Feb 2023). I have high hopes seeing as the original crew are back for this one. Mistakes were made, perhaps they will be corrected this final season.","rating":"4\/10","date":"6 February 2023"}

I guess it's true, at the end it felt very rushed.The \"endgame\" was in my opninion way to short, it good have been way better.But at least we saw Star Trek again, nice visuals.Acting was oke, although the son of Picard wasn't convincing to me, I'm sorry.But deep space nine , still my favorite.Picard will always be Star Trek .","rating":"8\/10","date":"5 December 2023"}
{"title":"Nothing new","review":"Sadly I agree with most of the lower scores here although somehow I enjoyed S3E1, mostly for nostalgic reasons. Having watched ST as a child I remember the total surprise at the technology shown. Sadly 55 years later not much changed even though the years passed in that universe. Ok, so we have warp 9.9. I agree totally with some comments made in some other reviews about the captain of the Titan, how did he get that position, surely not through impeccable leadership. Means the intelligence as a whole of star fleet is in reverse. The bunk bed and dinner scene wasn't funny at all. The shuttle landing on Beverly's ship laughable it was so poor. That spiked ship a copy. Only highlight was again 7of 9. Brilliant move to bring her back. I will not waste my time on mentioning Raffi. Let's see how the show progresses, maybe they can find some writers which have some imagination and actually design something new.","rating":"6\/10","date":"21 February 2023"}

It's just really really really really really really bad.You know when a company needs to milk a franchise because it needs to justify buying a show. That's what picard is. Paramount must have paid a TON of money for this and decided to make convoluted, stupid, insipid, dumb, just really stupid plots and then throw in even worse special effects into the mix and say, \"hey, it's a \"new franchise\"\".No, what this is is just really really really really really stupidly bad.I mean really stupidly bad.I wanted this to be good but after STRUGGLING to get through season 1, season 2 is just worse.Timelines, idiotic recasting of old plots because you know, you don't have any new or original ideas left.Did the \"writers\" of this turkey series simply just throw a bunch of darts at a board and think hey, it's a character we can \"work in\" to a series? That's EXACTLY how this plays.Just save yourself a lot of time and DO NOT WATCH THIS MONSTROSITY.It's just really really really really really really really really really really bad.See, you can say something is utter garbage without spoilers.","rating":"1\/10","date":"27 March 2022"}
{"title":"Season 3 is a whole new series with gloves off!","review":"Five episodes into season three (3) and every episode is better than the one before. Amazing work in every single aspect of cinematography. The effects are amazing. The characters are developing nicely so far. So much better than the first two seasons. It seems gloves are off!For the people complaining about age issues, that is life. Character grow old, their voice gets weaker, they do not look as sharp as when they are in their 30s. Acting though only gets better with experience. Having watched Sir Patrick Stewart on stage and now once again wearing the Starfleet uniform, I am personally so happy he is doing Season 3. He deserves such a level of production, since he is a damn good actor.The first two seasons were okay. A 7 for me. Season 3 is at another level. A solid 9. Whoever can not see that, try star wars guys! This is Star Trek!","rating":"10\/10","date":"16 March 2023"}
{"title":"I really loved this show.","review":"The third series is by far the best. The old crew from TNG are back together and it's just like watching more episodes of TNG if you loved TNG you will love this. It's just brilliant seeing how the TNG crew have aged and their back stories. Seeing Riker and Picard together again is just wonderful. Worf appears stronger than ever. I can fully recommend this show to all Star Trek fans. The stories are better and much more exciting. Ignore the bad scores from people who just did not like it. I personally look forward to a new episode every week. It certainly gave me my Star Trek fix which Star Trek Discovery did not.","rating":"10\/10","date":"9 March 2023"}
{"title":"Season three is a redemption and a triumph","review":"Update: Season 3 is a complete renaissance of this series. Characters with depth, the feeling that important things are genuinely at stake. Decent acting.--Prior review of S1 and S2:As a ST:TNG fan I wanted to like Picard.Sadly the first two seasons were a convoluted mess written by woke Hollywood hacks who clearly don't understand the appeal of Roddenberry-era Star Trek.Nonsensical plot lines. Established foes (the Borg for example) become shallow, silly caricatures. Too much Picard \"haunted by his past\" or delivering \"inspirational and heartwarming speeches,\" rather than solving problems in clever and authoritative TNG style.Just lazy by-the-numbers storywriting.Self-indulgent leftwing political talking points delivered in patronising, non-artistic style. I hate to see Star Trek infected with the woke mind virus. There's a massive difference between the progressiveness of TNG and the raw, divisive politicking of ST:Picard and Discovery. I'm fed up of my favourite franchises being turned into tedious identity politics lectures by \"holier than thou\" writers who don't care about the actual stories they're meant to be writing.Every TNG reference and character feels derivative and misplaced. Every new character seems a misfit in the Star Trek canon. Contrived and dull (Elnor). Completely Un-Starfleet-worthy (Rios, Raffie). Unfunny comic relief (Jurati). Laris is a little more interesting and likeable, but what is an Irish Romulan doing as Picard's house maid? It makes no sense at all.I'm torn. Plod on to see the cast reunion in series three? Or leave my last memories of the crew of the Enterprise 1701D intact and untainted?","rating":"9\/10","date":"24 June 2022"}

{"title":"Season 3 review only.","review":"It lost a star for beverly crusher's diverting power to the power source scene, which just seem like a just \"say something star trek\" improvisation. Which was just downright stupid. The rest however each episode got better and better. It makes me wonder how this series could have turned out , if this had been the first season and not the third. We probably would have had a lot more seasons. Firstly i would just like to point out that you do not need to watch season 1 and 2( if you can actually finish season 2 which i could only make it halfway) to know what going on as this is a stand alone story it is by far the best Star Trek has had in a long time. It is beautifully shot and has some incredible special effects, effect that would put marvel films to shame. It's not hard to put marvel to shame, but paramount went all out on this season. Some brilliant acting from the next generation crew and some great acting from ed speleers who I've not seen in anything before. Patrick stuart is alway incredible as are the next gen crew brent spiner is incredible too. Give it a watch but just leave the first two seasons as they deserve to be....\"unwatched\" go straight for season 3. There is a gut wrenching moment *spoiler*where riker turns on picard and i hated this, but it serves a purpose......i guess. There must have been a better way to do this without the kick in the guts that that scene gives. I guess that just good writing, when you really feel for these characters and you want them to get along, but they aren't and it's quite horrible. That just life though when your best friend who you've got along with most of your life just turns around and says the most horrible thing to you at a time when you really need their support. I would have given this ten if it weren't for the kick in the guts and crushers blunder.","rating":"9\/10","date":"28 November 2023"}
{"title":"This is NOT Star Trek","review":"After the greatest disappointment that was Discovery I had really high hopes for this one, especially after hearing that Patrick Stewart will return to reprise his iconic role he seemed to have abandoned long time ago and after watching 5 of the show's 10 episodes I have to admit that this is just as crappy as Discovery. A good show is supposed to present the characters you will sympathize with, root and care for, find something in common or at least anything - Picard does not have any of those characters. Even the titular JL is wasted and you just don't see him shine as brightly as he once was. Patrick tries his best to be Jean-Luc but after half of the first season I just don't see him in this role anymore. Overall the show is completely different from what you would expect from Star Trek: it doesn't have the depth, good characters, well-written stories and anything to think about after the episode is over. The original series was a masterful show, the Next Generation was a glorious comeback and superb continuation, Deep Space Nine was good in its own way, Voyager was a nice touch to expand the universe and Enterprise was a beautiful way to end the saga with the beginning. After that there were no Star Trek series no matter how frequently the writers and producers are eager to call them that. Picard is another piece of garbage that parasitizes on a great idea adding its nonsense into a fully grown and finished masterpiece no one asked for. I give it a six only because of Sir Patrick and the fact that I haven't finished the season yet and I think I'm not going to.","rating":"6\/10","date":"22 February 2020"}
{"title":"A desecration of Star Trek","review":"The writers of this must hate everything that people loved about Star Trek, the optimism for the future, the love of exploration, seeking of knowledge, the utopian society that allowed man to live in pursuit of his full potential, the philosophical and moral questions, the witty humor and most importantly the love of science and rationalism.They threw all that away and instead serve up a putrid stew of clich\u221a\u00a9 storytelling, emotional and weak minded characters and solving virtually every problem with violence. Because... Star Trek is all about the space action, right? Phasers n stuff. Borg.

{"title":"Skip Seasons 1 and 2, and jump in Season 3.","review":"Like most other viewers, I'm a Star Trek fan, watched everything, some multiple times.Picard sounded amazing, but then Season 1 dropped and was bad. Only to be outdone by an even worse Season 2. I'll be honest, I had no desire to watch season 3, since the first 2 were so bad. Really glad I tried it.It's really sad they wasted the first 2 seasons on whatever that was, because that was neither good TV nor good Trek. If you are just now wanting to pick this up and watch, there is no point in watching the first two seasons. Just skip them and you're not missing out on anything.Everything just works in Season 3: we finally have a compelling story, there's a reason for the characters to be present, there's a lot of fan service but it doesn't feel forced, it makes sense within the story they are telling. It just feels right.My rating of 9 is solely based on Season 3. I just pretend Seasons 1 and 2 don't exist.","rating":"9\/10","date":"13 April 2023"}
{"title":"Quite weak show, quite boring and convoluted.","review":"This show is completely forgettable. Does not have any fiber of good writing in it. Probably they thought that if they threw in Picard and some old-time star trek names\/images, then it would work. It doesn't. You have to force yourself to watch it, and only if you are a Star Trek fan. It is quite a drag. After watching a few episodes, I still don't know what they were doing exactly. Some artificial characters, Picard who is very old and frail, some action that nowadays is lame, and some ships (these are nice). That's it. No big ideas, no atmosphere, no strong new stuff. Quite disappointing.. I guess the 7.4 rating on imdb is from ST fans nostalgic for Next Generation episodes.","rating":"6\/10","date":"3 May 2022"}
{"title":"Long-Time Trek Fan: This Show Makes Me Sad","review":"It's clear that the writers neither know the characters of Picard and Riker nor basic contemporary science. An examination of both:In season 1, they portray Picard as a kind of galactic troublemaker who is always in trouble. His interactions with other major characters from TNG are warped by this; Picard was always an organized, disciplined, and law-abiding man, not a Loki-esque trickster. In season 2, they portray Picard as always late; the man was always the definition of punctuality.In season 1, they portray Picard and Riker as a pair of bullies because they have penises. This was so Deanna Troi could scold them about their incivility because--you know--writing for women means men must always be shallow as opposed to women being written well.I just stopped watching season 2 after one of the characters made a reference to \"early ozone erosion\" in the year 2024. Um...no. Not quite, sweetie. We've reversed the damage to the ozone layer; it's a great thing and something we should be proud of because it reveals that we can heal the planet and that we should. But it's more important to scold the viewer based on scientific ignorance than it is to acknowledge we've done something good for the planet. The writers either didn't do their research or just felt that it was more important to throw in an environmental morality lesson that we don't need in order to sell their product.Overall, the series is poorly written. Several characters (mainly women) come off as horrible hypocrites in terms of what they say as opposed to what they do. This isn't strong character development for female characters--it's just bad writing and incredibly shallow.Here's a good lesson for the writers of the Kurz-Trek-verse: stop injecting your politics into everything because it's making for stupid TV. You know neither politics nor science.Leaving Picard now. One to beam out.","rating":"3\/10","date":"17 March 2022"}

You not just bring nostalgia, but a new timeline and believable plot how the veterans ends up.My only down side is, too dark.

{"title":"Rating is only for Season 3","review":"Do not watch seasons 1, 2, for that would be like eating sawdust as an appetizer to a gourmet meal (no, not a vegan one either).Season 3 is an appropriate (dare I say respectful?) culmination of the original series. Men and women work in conjunction according to their capacities, flaws and all. If you love seeing girl bosses and castrated males, this show isn't for you (neither is good art). Characters are brought back in plot-driven and\/or character development manner, and not just the main cast either.... not superfluous member-berry style. Not only that, I'll be very clear. As television it's excellent. It's whimsical, it's humorous, it's philosophical, it's suspenseful. Individual episodes feel like I just watched an entire movie.

The clumsy Californian political messaging of recent has worn us all down. But coming into Season 3 I could clearly see something had changed, someone who loved the franchise was clearly at the helm, perhaps for the first time in a long time and that passion has shone through.And again like so many other i rejoiced as the TNG family reassembled yet I couldn't help feel sad that a vital member of that family was missing.

{"title":"Edit - Seasons 1 & 2 Awful! Season 3 excellent!","review":"Season 1 & 2 - The writing, awful. The dialogue, awful. The premise, confusing and awful. The acting, sometimes awful, sometimes passable.Season 3 - Now that's more like it! It still has its faults and at times weighed down by poor writing decisions from season 1, but Terry Matalas and team really pulled off the unthinkable with season 3 to make it a fun, well written, very well acted and exciting season.I give the series a 7 purely because seasons 1 & 2 bring the score down.For me, Terry Matalas saved Star Trek from Alex Kurtzman. Matalas knows trek, he's a fan of the original series movies, which is clear to see, and he's a fan of The Next Generation, which was a necessity for running this show. He gets it and I applaud him.The CGI is excellent, I like the new Titan. The production was brilliant, if not a little dark. Jack Crusher is an interesting character that I wanted to know more about. I was excited to see the old crew of the Enterprise D\/E reunite. And there's even a cameo from my favourite Trek ship the enterprise Refit (well, it's 'A' equivalent from star treks 4 to 6).The score for season 3 is also excellent. There's a few nods to the scores of Jerry Goldsmith and James Horner, which I found to be a very nice touch. It's a very Star Trek score, with a lot of new material to compliment the familiar musical cues.Give seasons 1 & 2 a miss and go straight to season 3, but just know that Picard died at the end of season 1 and was brought back as an android... yeah... that's a thing!New trek is on its backside with people who simply don't get it and try to aim it at the wrong people. Even Strange New Worlds is a key example of how not to do trek. Yet Picard Season 3 is the exception. It's run by people who get star trek and it's aimed at the fans. If only Terry Matalas would do a follow up series on the Titan A \/ Enterprise G.","rating":"7\/10","date":"8 April 2022"}

{"title":"Give it a chance!","review":"If you even just a tiny bit familiar with The Next Generation or Star Trek Voyager, keep watching! As the series progresses, it introduces just the right amount of nostalgia, canon, and new tech & experiences!There is a much broader character depth explored within this series. It expounds on relationships, backgrounds, and goings on in so many fun new ways. Picard is sure to take you on a journey.You will not regret the decision to commit to sticking it out through the ups and downs, the slow moving episodes (there are only a few), and the continued exploration to boldly go where no Star Trek series has gone before!","rating":"9\/10","date":"20 March 2023"}
{"title":"Picard S1+S2 was slow ... but S3 is an exceptional.","review":"This is Star Trek should be and that was on S3. This is maybe the last of Patrick Steward last seen on screen. All old crew Star Trek back in S3EP6 was interesting to watch and the old enemies is also coming back. This last trek of Picard is opening way to new crew and series or movie for all upcoming Star Trek. The music of Trek they taken from First Contact composed by Jerry Goldsmith gives me feeling of nostalgic of Old Star Trek. This S3 of Picard is on the right track to return from its glory and splendor. You should watch this S3 of Picard if you are Star Trek fans, its because the only of all old crew from First Contact together once again for one Final Mission.","rating":"9\/10","date":"24 March 2023"}
{"title":"Season 3 10\/10","review":"I'm judging this on season 3. Season 1&2 were a nice revisit of the character, and on their own, I would give them 6\/10.Season 3 is a stand-alone masterpiece.Anyone who appreciates Star Trek will enjoy this; any Star Trek fan will love it. The writers have given fans a deep dive into all the universe characters. Picard, Riker, Worf, Geordie, Crusher, Deanna, Moriarty, Data, seven of nine, B4, Lore, Ro Laren, Odo, even a glimpse of James T Kirk and much more.The cinematography is fantastic, the storylines integrated wonderfully, and the ships are, well, majestic. They even provided a quick look at NCC1701-A, the downed bird of prey from star trek 4 the voyage home.I'm judging this on everything I've seen up to episode 5 and so far there have been so many well crafted nostalgic goosebumps moments. This is the movie the next gen cast should have been given.We all age, we all see time slip away and the fresh take on the next gen lives is welcome. Episode 5 discusses the need to let things be, and dont hang on to what was, let it be something new.This is new, this is interesting and it's brilliant.","rating":"10\/10","date":"24 March 2023"}

These new shows are the complete opposite of what Star Trek should be and the creators clearly have no understanding of why the fans love the show as they do.

{"title":"From a 2 to a 10!!! Season 3 Rocks","review":"I guess Strange New Worlds helped them find Star Trek again because I had Star Trek Picard rated as a 2. My wife who is a huge Star Trek fan wouldn't even watch it. But they really turned it around. If it was just season 3, I would rank it a full blown 10!!!What an awesome season. We are back on board a Star Ship and doing what Trek does best when it goes back to Treking. This season is one of the best and is very much the best part of The Next Generation. It was a great idea for them to bring the cast back. The only disappointing thing about the show is that this is Patrick Stewart's last year. But I am hoping they do a spin off show based on the crew of the Titan. What a fun time.","rating":"10\/10","date":"11 April 2023"}

It just takes a big, fat dump on everything that has gone before.The character of Picard was a principaled, dignified, strong leader but sadly becomes pretty much the antithesis of that in this series.The men in this are all pretty hopeless and its the \"strong\" women who have to step up . . . Yawn. You don't make strong female characters just by making weak male ones.Can tell where series 2 is going with this going back in time to 2024 BS in order to \"save the timeline\" - its going to be more pushing of the writers political agenda, filled with pointless melodrama, no thanks.","rating":"6\/10","date":"19 March 2022"}

{"title":"Better show if writers would stay out of politics","review":"I would've given the show a 8 or 9 but starting in Season 2 episode 3 and 4 the writers decided to inject their own personal political opinions into the story line.Nothing like trying to watch your favorite genre of science fiction and while being bombarded with the villanization of ICE and other institutions.But I guess this is the new style of writing from Paramount shows as Discovery has all but wiped white people out of their view of the future.Truly a sad approach to what should be entertainment.

{"title":"Gene Roddenberry Really IS Dead","review":"TNG was the apex of the Star Trek universe. People loved it. It showed us sometimes flawed characters who always strived to be better than they were. These characters were developed on screen. They did more than just fight and argue and push the main plot of the story.TNG rewarded viewers with a sense of hope and something great to look and build forward to. It wasn't a reflection of what we as people ARE, but what we could so easily be.So what do we get if we take TNG and remove the wonder of discovery, the passion to explore, any sense of warmth, ALL OPTIMISM, futuristic technological innovation, actors who connect with their characters, imagination, the rigid moral structure, discipline, professionalism, alien races, special effects, and just make the entire thing a bit more common and profane? We get a glimpse of what the future would be like if the most spoiled, selfish, weak people populated the world and the only advancements humanity made were technological.Class warfare. Limited resources. A disdain for age \/ accomplishment. And just a few little ties thrown in to try to lure fans of Voyager and TNG in hoping some percentage of them will stay for a bland, frozen, microwaved version of what was once a favorite dish.It's great to see Patrick Stewart acting in this, but it'd be even better if he'd reprise the role of Jean-Luc Picard in more than just name.Dear Gene Roddenberry,We respectfully disagree with your Utopian vision of tomorrow. The future is actually just a bunch of fearful, self-centered, bickering millennials (some of which have pointy ears and others of which are robots) driven by a raging torrent of emotions to do whatever feels good. In space.Signed,\nCBS","rating":"4\/10","date":"27 March 2020"}
{"title":"A sad, tired old stumbling wreck","review":"Describes most aspects of this disaster of a show.Fanboi Stanning aside, Patrick Stewart is painful to watch. He has lost so much of his range and delivery that he borders on being really pitiful rather than simply acting it.The Next Gen and Voyager guests do a credible job with the few lines that they're given, but the writing is so weak, and they are forced so far into the background that they can't save it.The new crew is a mere trope - a rag tag bunch of unappealing drop outs and losers. Their cliched backstories are told in exposition, rather than shown - the big tiddy space elf ninja antagonist actually gets more depth. The inconsistent and randomly written characters are all over the place, running the gamut from angry to sad, pathetic to remorseful, but never, ever joyous. None of them have the acting chops to rise above the material, with the inexplicably cast Alison Pill in particular bringing some real cringe to her Thrift Store Kristen Bell performance.And I don't want to hear \"Give it a season to gel\", because Firefly managed it in one episode. When the writing, acting and direction are present, that's all it takes. Picard has none of those things behind the camera, and I get no feeling that the on-camera talent likes or respects each other enough to work around the laziness of writers who resort to completely unnecessary profanity every time they're stuck.It's not absolutely awful. Isa Briones is appealing enough in her various roles, Santiago Cabrera can do a range of third best accents, and Tamlyn Tomita owns all her scenes with the kind of quiet authority that Stewart has sadly lost.The effects and cinematography are competent enough. The score is too, but tries to over-sell both the the drama and depth of what's on screen.But the merits are too small and too far between to make up for the lack of pace, vision, respect for the milieu, or talent on either side of the camera. Picard is a grim, joyless, grimy grind, and I don't think anyone involved had any fun at all in making it.The shill ratings are wrong, and the reviews are right: this is a largely unrelated grimdark concept wearing the skin of a hollowed-out redshirt.","rating":"","date":"27 July 2021"}

Dave Filoni who know and listen. But Hopefully this isn't the end for Star Trek, if people would leave they're egos out of the equation I think Star Trek will have the shows that take the fans into account and provide years of quality content.","rating":"8\/10","date":"13 April 2023"}

Great to see Star Trek is still as good now as it was in the 70s.Story and characters are fantastic to see. Its a beautiful show with all the spectacular brilliaht graphics.

They've taken all of the best aspects of Star Trek over the years and added a sprinkling of updates, not too much.I'm a big TNG fan, so this presses all my buttons.

{"title":"The Take Of Three Seasons: 1=good, 2=horrible, 3=Amazing","review":"Season 1 was entertaining enough. There are definitely better Star Trek series, but the story of season 1 was captivating and kept my attention.Season 2 is different. Whoopi Goldberg is so annoying I can't stand her, nor her characters.Here's what I don't get: In these fictional futures, where you can transport across a plant in an instant; why do large cities even exist anymore? It seems a lot more logical that, with that technology, population density would even out across all parts of a planet.Season 3 was incredibly redemptive. Perhaps the best culmination of a series ever. Soooooooo many cameos, old characters, old technology....and it all fit together into a story line that made sense and naturally brought these old characters back without feeling forced at all. If you loved The Next Generation, so you absolutely LOVE season 3 of Picard!!! Truly. My original review still exists above this paragraph.

{"title":"Please hire some real writers!!!!","review":"I waited to watch this series till recently because after watching discovery I was afraid they would destroy this show as well. I watched it with an opened mind and barely got through the first season, now having watched the 2nd season I feel like the creators of this show must think they are writing a show for idiots with no imagination or moral compass. I wonder what Gene Roddenberry would think of this mindless abomination? It seems they just make up plot twists as they go along, the storyline seems to change constantly and just drags on and on, it gets pretty monotonous at points. I really wanted to like this show, but I don't think I can stand too watch another episode.","rating":"3\/10","date":"2 December 2022"}
{"title":"The worst Trek series by far","review":"I thought I would like this. It has so many of my favorite characters from the old shows including Picard and Seven.But no. It's so so so bad. How can almost nothing of interest happen in a show for 10 whole hours? It's not slowly building the story\/characters, it's just slow and nothing happens. The characters are bad. The dialogue is bad. The story is nonsense and the premise is terrible.Episode 1 was okay, but after that it just kept getting worse. Every episode was another snoozefest of nothing happening. The same tired crud of old Picard rambling with another soulless character. The Romulan and his sister arguing again about how they are failures at their jobs and how he needs to stop making out with the robot girl (then proceeds to make out with her again, yay). A little action scene here and there. More about how Mars attack was bad, need to find the girl, Starfleet problems, mean admirals, blah blah. Tal Shiar bad. Picard sad about his life. Throw in a 5 minute cameo. Ughhhhhh.There is no coherence to this story, no actual character development. Just boring, bland talking for hours and hours on end. This was truly PAINFUL to watch.At least Discovery had some action and interesting scenes in its first few seasons. This has nothing. It's trash.","rating":"","date":"6 June 2022"}

Skip season 1 & 2 and go straight to Season 3. Jonathan Frakes direction is superb. Worf is back in fine form - aged a bit. Beverly Crusher at her best. Plenty of plot threads that are picked up from old shows - fan service, but if you dont know them, you can still enjoy the show. Finally some solid writing & plot.I watched Discover for 2 Seasons - it was OK and then left after crazy Season 3. I love Strange New Worlds and hope it stays around a while. Glad that Paramount listened to fans, as Pike & spock Made season 2 of Discovery.Hopefully Paramount will change their mind now and do Season 4 Of Picard.

{"title":"Season 3: the season that all fans have been waiting for","review":"Let's start with the basics: I am a french trekkie and have watched all the TV shows, except discovery (seriously the klingons.. and the unsympathetic hero). For Enterprise, I love Scott Bakula as an actor and you want to befriend the guy.. but it was difficult to see him as an actual captain. Deep Space Nine is my favorite, then TNG. Voyager was a fun (bug too long) experience and going deeper into the Borg storyline.Ok review: Picard season 1 & 2 are ok but disappointing; obviously the show is named Picard.. so it had to be around him, but the 2 seasons were far too centered on him, his past, his regrets, to a slow drift towards death, to the extent you might just stop caring about his storyline. Yes Picard was great but you don't want him to self-congratule, right ?BUT season 3 is the season that all true Star Trek fans have been hoping for. And I am not writing that lightly. We have had those movies trying to transform Star Trek in space opera or making it action\/adventure style.. That's just not Star Trek. Star Trek is about exploration of worlds and ideas.. And trying to make us think of the society as a whole and how it can evolve. Imagine in the 80s, we were already speaking about : what if AI becomes sentient ? Does it has rights ? Would they really be superior in all ways ? The paradox of Data wanting to be human and his counterpart Lore wanting to rule over lesser evolve humans. The transfer of consciousness in machines, the ethics and problems of cloning. Etc. True Star Trek fans love the shows because they made them think and hope in possible futures.So now that you see how I think, here is why I love Picard Season 3 and I think it's the show we have been all waiting for:(spoiler alert)\nThey finally are reusing old story arcs of characters. The relation between Kimberly and Picard. The family story of Picard, being the last of his long lasting dynasty and his deep regret of not having a son. Worf and his internal human\/klingon conflict and how to behave properly, mastering and freeing his inner violence when needed and being... just Worf (imagine Jadzia speaking). Riker and Troy, their family, their lost son, the effects on them and yet their everlasting love being challenged. Ro Laren and the deep intrication of the Bajoran religious (parallel to WWII, the occupation, rebellion, faith, pardon).. and even.. changelings and the dominion wars ! Possibly I have a bias here as DS9 was my favorite of all show, but it's great to see that epic storyline coming back with all that it can bring to the universe. Now, I don't know *yet* they are going with it.. and it could be that they completely fail at the end of the season, especially if they are push to finish early and they won't change opinion on having a season 4. But so far, it's been a pleasure to see that story coming up to life, and all those conflicts\/fears resurfacing.In addition to all that, they went on simple yet effective designs for the generic and for the music. Nothing too crazy, too flashy, too colorful like in Star Trek Strange New World where you feel like you may be watching a cartoon. Just the right balance to show it's Star Trek and yet more modern.. but not in the wrong way.So what I love about that season 3 is that it's a lot more balanced: those are story lines around Picard but this time we come back to Picard and Riker living those stories rather than remembering the \"good old days\". And the integration of all those characters we loved definitely helped to achieve that balance and reaffirm a strong feeling of belonging to the Star Trek family.So yes, season 3 is the show that all Star Trek fans have been waiting for, with all the characters they love, reuniting with old characters storylines, gathering them towards new adventures and the goal of saving the federation from another new infiltration of changelings.. with no one you can trust.My only fear is this: in season 3, they are giving a lot to Star Trek fans.. and it's great. But will they be able to keep up with the pace they gave ? Will they manage to live up to all the conflicts and expectations they are raising ? I think they might.. and that the first 2 seasons they were fine tuning on how to create a Star Trek TV show in our technological\/violent era where if things don't crash and burn in 2s, people are uninterested. It's not perfect, but I think they reached that level where they have a solid story, solid set of characters, solid design.. so let's go where no man has gone before !","rating":"10\/10","date":"23 March 2023"}

{"title":"Star Trek: Picard - Boldly Going Nowhere","review":"Star Trek: Picard has to be the most disappointing and unpleasant show I've ever had the misfortune of experiencing. It was a catastrophe, quite literally an act of utter barbarity.\nOr in other words: A very poorly-written piece of generic action sci-fi.Right from the start, the series falls flat on its face.\nInstead of \"boldly going where no one has gone before\" and exploring strange new worlds and charting the unknown, Season One of \"Picard\" is essentially about how the artificial intelligences we create could overcome us. Well, that's very interesting and original, RIGHT?\nAs for the rest of the plot:\nEverything's pretty much nonsense, there are loads of things that don't make sense or remain unexplained and there's a significant amount of continuity errors. The writing feels like someone collected drafts from the trashcan in the writer's room and turned them into one big, serialized mess.\nThe show also has the strange habit of randomly introducing unnecessary subplots & concepts just to forget about them later.The characters: Unnatural, clich\u221a\u00a9d, one-dimensional, antagonistic, always depressed and over-emotional - That's how I would describe them.\nI mean what character traits other than that do they even have? Jurati vomits all the time, Rios is a poor-man's Han Solo, Elnor just exists, Raffi is a arrogant drug-addict who lives in a trailer (in a time where poverty was solved centuries ago and drug addiction is easily curable), Seven of Nine's now an angsty lesbian alcoholic murderer, Picard went from being a intelligent, deeply moral & passionate leader to a childish, impulsive & confused fool, and then there's Narek & his mustache-twirling villain sister and believe me, they have a rather strange relationship going on...Even the way the show depicts the Federation is completely off: A bleak, problematic and merciless place. There's classism, money made a comeback, everyone drinks real alcohol (what happened to synthehol?) & smokes, people swear and use 21st century contemporary language and no one's happy.\nIt seems like the entire Federation society has turned into a dystopia - the exact opposite of Star Trek. Funny, isn't it?Picard suffers from the same deseases that plagued Discovery: Too much emphasis on spectacle, action & plot twists, rushed concepts & plotlines which are sometimes \"borrowed\" from different movies, series and games (in this case especially Mass Effect 3), cringeworthy dialogue and unnecessarily gruesome violence & gore.\nThis is exactly the type of entertainment that appeals to the audience CBS tries to target: Empty-minded people with attention spans of goldfishes.\nWhat a great way to honor Roddenberry.And seriously, what kind of uncreative & talentless people worked on this show? Shutterstock footage, copy & pasting of an entire fleet of starships, heavy usage of Discovery's design language...\nThis show is excellent at being lazy and unoriginal.I find it laughable that there are fans who blindly defend this load of crap. Since its first episode, ST:P has done nothing but constantly contradicting & ignoring what made Star Trek, well... Star Trek.\nThe problem is that both ST:P & ST:D try to emulate Deep Space Nine's darkness and more \"realistic\" tone without even attempting to understand why it worked for that series. DS9 never contradicted the franchise's positive view of the future, it only challenged and explored it further.\nAnd despite all the \"grittiness\" DS9 had, it was, like all iterations of Star Trek up to that point, quite optimistic and hopeful.Reddit user KingofMadCows wrote a very insightful comment on that subject:\"Discovery and Picard have the darkness of DS9 but not the depth.\nThey want to exist in the more complex and gritty world of DS9 but they still resolved problems as easily as TNG, without doing any of the extra work of DS9.\"But I guess this is no longer Star Trek. This is the thing that killed Star Trek, and is now wearing its face as a mask.","rating":"3\/10","date":"22 April 2020"}
{"title":"Same Picard! But definitely not where we left him...","review":"Before I start my recommendation is to go into this completely spoiler free. Don't listen to any of the nonsense about political agendas or the like as they're not being written by anyone whose seen the show. Got to see a pre screen of the first 3 episodes though I'm no critic or studio person, just a fan. It's not a super dark take on the future that the Children of Mars short leads some to believe (think of that short as a Wolf 359 or a Dominion War moment that is many years in this show's past that informs what happens but doesn't define it).That out of the way, I was privileged to see a prescreen of the first three episodes and this is definitely the Picard you remember. Granted he's now 94 years old, he's long retired going out on a new adventure for the first time in a decade plus... but it's still Jean-Luc Picard at his core. Seeing him have to work from a position of relative powerlessness given his current station in life without the might and resources of the Federation Starfleet behind him in no way diminishes the character or what he's doing. Assembling a hodgepodge crew of former associates, new friends, and questionable contacts. If anything it's an interesting twist on the Star Trek formula to see one of its characters in anything but their prime in a position of authority on a powerful Federation starship or space station but rather essentially an elderly civilian. It makes Picard's determination to stay true to the man who helmed the Enterprise D and E that much more endearing to watch. I for one can't wait to see where they take us the latter part of this first season and into season 2.","rating":"10\/10","date":"15 January 2020"}

And, quite honestly, until the second episode I though it might happen. But. And a big but too.Most of the reviews point to the apparent factors driving the series down; bad character arcs, pop-up \"guest star\" appearances that do nothing (like the Troi-Riker happy home on the range tripe), hackneyed dialogue, and (perhaps most worryingly) far too much conscious or unconscious mirroring of other franchises (pick Star Wars, Serenity, Guardians of the Galaxy, Lord of the Rings, I Robot, good grief even Blade Runner off-takes) through the whole thing. When the original Star Trek (with all its low-fi special effects and sometimes hokey plot lies - remember the Khums and Yangs?) came out, for tv it was fresh and tried to cover new ground, albeit not cutting edge ground. That made up for any shortfalls, much as it did in STNG, but after that the curve is downwards.So, at the root, this fails for a few reasons.1. The Star Trek 'universe' is so confused, twisted, inconsistent, and inherently contradictory that no plot line can be created, or sustained, with any degree of veracity - except for the die-hard fans who, as long as there's a phaser and a white picket fence outcome, will ignore it all and applaud;\n2. The history of the Star Trek franchise confines writers to a specific, final, predetermined outcome;\n3. The use of multiple writers and directors working on different parts of the series is a near guarantee of a disjointed and inconsistent tale; and\n4. The ongoing penchant for both cameos from STNG \/ Voyager actors, plus involvement in the direction and screen-writing form the same, ties the plot in knots and adds what the Scots would term a \"twee\" feel to it all. The only thing missing was a Scottish brogue proclaiming \"I canna hold er captain\".As much as I am sure Picard made money for CBS and made for good entertainment for some Star Trek fans, it is time to kill of the franchise. There is too much good, original, science fiction out there crying for airtime to let this old clanger splutter on.","rating":"2\/10","date":"30 May 2021"}
{"title":"Marginally better than Star Trek: Discovery","review":"Unfortunately, all the reasons true Trekkies hated Discovery are still there;1) The boring yet overly convoluted plot that takes forever to get going.\n2) Forgettable, indifferent, uninteresting, unrelatable, unprofessional and overly snarky\/confrontational characters.\n3) Boring and bleak visual style.\n4) Unnecessary and misguided attempts to be dark and edgy (e.g. cursing, graphic violence) which feels very un-Trek.\n5) Vapid and pointless filler dialogue.The only thing that makes Picard better than Discovery, is that it at least tries to be an ensemble cast show, whereas Discovery was basically The Amazing Michael Burnham Show.","rating":"","date":"19 February 2020"}
{"title":"Season 3 (first 5 episodes)","review":"Can we call it like it is? This is Star trek TNG season 8. Well, close enough. And this is what we all ever wanted.Season 1 and 2 were about the guy we all knew with a bunch of boring characters nobody cared for, in boring stories. Honestly, I can't remember what was it all about.Season 3 (for now) is far more interesting. Yes, there is just one loooong story arch, again. But it's interesting. For the first time in \"Picard\", I can't wait to see the next episode!It's great to see old crew back...\nBeverly looks amazing, Worf is so cute as samurai\/klingon warior\/philosopher, Will is still the man I want to serve under...Vadic as a villain is quite interesting, but we have to see who her boss is and I hope that the showrunners wont screw this up.For now, it's great. I want to see more!","rating":"9\/10","date":"19 March 2023"}
{"title":"Season 1 confusing, season 2 fever dream, season 3 phenomenal","review":"Gotta be honest. Season one was so-so. It had a lot of confusing stuff going on, lots of story lines that never seemed coalesce. Not bad, but outside the nostalgia factor def not good. I thought I still saw some potential.Season 2 was like an acid trip from hell. It was inexplicably confusing while being equally uninteresting. I had zero intention on watching season three after this outing.However, I found myself in a show hole, and saw it was being cancelled, so I decided to check out season three... perhaps my bar is really low, because of how bad 2 was. But either way, season 3 has been incredibly enjoyable so far. To the point where I wish they weren't cancelling it! Perhaps it will get a spin off with jean Luc's son picking up the mantle?? Regardless, if they can keep writing like they have so far this season, it's a shame they're ending it. Frankly, it doesn't seem possible that they achieve a satisfying story arch over the remaining episodes, as it seems as though four episodes in like were still in the prologue of whatever story their trying to tell. I guess in the end only time will tell if the remaining episode manage to hold up to what has a really great showing so far this season.","rating":"8\/10","date":"11 March 2023"}
{"title":"Season 1 was Ok... Season 2 was a bit of a letdown... but Season 3 is an INCREDIBLE SURPRISE!!!","review":"I was excited to see my favorite captain return one last time so I went into S1 with excitement. While it wasn't perfect and it diverged a bit from the standard Trek formula, I enjoyed it.Season 2 I thought had a weaker plot and was only held together by some solid performances by the talented cast.But WOW this \"Final Season\" is like an entirely different show in terms of how stellar the performances and writing are. Not to mention the production quality and atmosphere. What an amazing surprise after thinking S3 would be average at best! Must watch. The new showrunner is terrific and I hope to see him get much more opportunities to tell engaged high quality stories without a lot of the modern day downfalls of other projects.In short, Season 1 was good but may not be for some staunch old school TNG fans. Season 2 missed the mark a bit but is worth perhaps viewing but Season 3 is absolutely amazing and I believe can be viewed entirely independent of the first 2 although I'd still recommend trying them out first.P. S. - the directors and showrunner have brought out the absolute BEST performances from these cast members that I have ever seen in their entire careers. Credit to the actors of course as well but they were aided by solid writing and direction for sure.","rating":"9\/10","date":"17 March 2023"}

Sorry, I think they were great shows.Admittedly I didn't enjoy Discovery - tried twice and just couldn't warm up to the show. But I was cautiously looking forward to PICARD.\nSome of our favorite characters, Picard, Data, Seven! But ultimately in a mediocre show.The story was so-so. Character development was not there. Heck, I couldn't even get into the characters I know and love until episode 6 or 7.\nThat's poor writing\/story telling.The \"space elf\" felt like he was in the wrong show LOL\nWould have loved to see more Borg action, more actual \"synths are bad\" demonstrations, more emotional involvement tying the main cast together somehow. They had 10 episodes to make that happen. And they failed.Also, I'm sorry - I love him dearly but Sir Patrick Stewart is really too old for this.\nI'm actually glad Brent Spiner decided not to return as Data ever again.","rating":"6\/10","date":"10 September 2020"}

The series is embarrassing. Mexican soap operas are less ridiculous. Look at the IMDB comments, it has all the flaws in the comments.

Keep your discoverys, SNW , and the animated ones, but we really need a trek like this also. This is mint star trek. Robert Burnett is was right to push this show as hard as he did.

{"title":"Picard Season 3 is just superb!","review":"As someone who has been an avid fan of TOS from its very beginning as a pre teen, the TOS films, TNG and its movies, DSN (any other including recent incarnations not so much: for instance, SNW is tedious and besides,\nJeffrey Hunter will always be Christopher Pike) I can say Picard Season 3 IS a true continuation of TNG both in spirit and execution. It follows my belief that a sequel must involve the original characters and capture the feel, tension and excitement of the best episodes, as Season 3 does wonderfully well. And the acting! Kudos to Amanda Plummer, so much like her dad as Chang, playing Vadic and who'd ever think Jonathan Frakes could be so good as he is now as a senior Ryker. (I can see him playing Orson Welles!)The first two seasons left me cold and wasted Q, Data looked weird, but this one makes up for them totally. You will be \"transported\" back to the thrill you first got with the best of TOS and TNG.","rating":"","date":"10 March 2023"}
{"title":"Season 3, BEST TREK YET","review":"The story is pretty awesome so far and bringing in the original characters from across the TREK universe is utterly amazing and nostalgic but it WORKS, making sone of the best TREK I've ever enjoyed watching.The first season of Picard features Sir Patrick Stewart reprising his iconic role as Jean-Luc Picard, which he played for seven seasons on Star Trek: The Next Generation. The new series will follow this iconic character into the next chapter of his life. I found it interesting but was t sure if Patrick Stewart was slightly past it.The second season completely went in a new direction that I sometimes struggled with but great character development but still wasn't sure if Patrick Stewart was just too oldNow to season three, what a change, they pulled out all the stops, all the characters from every star trek spin off, and WOW, why is this the final season ???Season 3, BEST TREK YET.","rating":"10\/10","date":"5 April 2023"}

{"title":"Season 3 - Feels Like The MOVIE The Never Was","review":"I enjoyed the first two seasons, tho I sort of agree with a lot of the criticism of other reviewersif this was STNG -After Starfleet with a private limo that's the enterprise , but it's not, it's Picard, about Picard and his fallible mistakes he's made thru his life and at his latter end of his life realises this and the regrets and his weaknesses that accompany these realisations. The step away from the Utopia characters for me a refreshing touch, they're Human and get affected with tragedy like the rest of us there are societies that are vicious that have fallen to social deprivation.S3 they really have ploughed a budget into this giving it a really movie feel (makes up for the previous films), it's given an end back story to our favourite STNG peoples! And the return of the most evil arch nemesis ever to Grace any sci-fi series to boot - c'mon the simplicity, efficiency and emotionless traits of these barbarians are not the stuff of nightmares and even more terrifying a true reflection of our own actual history (NAZI's as a more recent example)Picard isn't STNG, it's different & Brilliant in its own right giving us a different side to all our characters, the human side. The writers have thought out the characters well, even if at the start of the series some seem random, annoying even pointless but it turns out they're there for a purpose.At present I'm at episode 9 of series 3, nearly all episodes have given nostalgic quiver up my spine at some point. I hope you enjoy all these series at much as I.Interesting Fact - Michael Dorn (Worf) has a pilots license and owned a old U. S Jet fighter (not sure if he still does) while filming the original STNG series part of his contract was that he's was grounded until the end of filming each season........ just in case his flying skill were not that great\u00f0\u0178\u02dc\u201a\u00f0\u0178\u00a4\u00a3\u00f0\u0178\u02dc\u201a","rating":"10\/10","date":"16 April 2023"}

Star Trek: Picard 'is' of elegance and 'is' of sophistication, and contains 'beautiful' high technological graphics, colors and lighting!It's computer-generated images are sharp and crisp in ultra-HD. Patrick Stewart's acting brings captivation, compliments all the actresses\/actors, and pulls you in with his raw emotion.There is lots of canon, very different from Star Trek: Discovery. This show is really classical Star Trek based, sticking to the roots of Star Trek: TNG with lots of Star Trek's universe 'packed' inside. And the cinematography is well designed too. It feels and looks and smells like Star Trek (which is very important).Watch this show, it's very good and I highly recommend it!

The best thing that can be said about \"Star Trek: Picard\" is \"it's better than Star Trek: Discovery\", but that's not saying much. The writing for this series is so weak, even Patrick Stewart's charisma and acting chops can't save it. Paramount+ obviously needs to recruit a creative team who have an appreciation for the franchise Star Trek franchise, its history and its fans.

Picard is now great Star Trek again and just about everything wrong with previous seasons has been completely fixed.We need Terry Matalas to do a lot more Star Trek and be put in control of the franchise, not Kurtzman or JJ Abrams who just have no clue what Star Trek is at all.Hopefully we get a 4th season and\/or a TNG movie.

{"title":"Season 3 for the win!","review":"Oh, my, god. Picard season 3 is by FAR the greatest of what we've seen of the new Star Trek shows. Perhaps part of the reason is that it's been a long time since there was good Trek, but I am honestly blown away. Hats off to Terry Matalas for turning the ship around and pulling this off. What's been missing from the new shows is the comradery and togetherness of the crew. The infusion of all the old characters from TNG instantly brings all that back. At the same time, the show is molded into a modern non-episodic format. It works! I think part of the reason the new shows have been having a hard time finding their footing is that there's just not enough episodes being produced. With the old shows, we got about 26 episodes per season, and lord knows there were stinkers, yet even still, every episode is a little piece of character development and crew development. Strange New Worlds has the potential to achieve this, however there just aren't enough episodes being produced. Discovery technically has had enough episodes, but they haven't managed to build the characters and crew properly. I so wish there would be more Star Trek: Picard after this season is done! But before the season is over and done with, I think we've got a hell of a surprise in store for us. Can't wait!","rating":"10\/10","date":"9 March 2023"}

It was a standalone story of the former captain of the famous starship Enterprise. It was interesting.Season Two....well, I would recommend avoiding it all together.Season Three...WOW!!

{"title":"Great for Great People","review":"I can't believe the many negative comments. This is better in ways - but different - than any other Star Trek Series. This has nothing in common with Discovery - which imo is really a disaster. Picard is entertaining, characters are interesting, the story develops, the theme is fresh and it gets better every week according to my personal humble opinion. I am a huge TNG, Voyager and DS9 fan and Picard is the only show which truly keeps loyal to the core philosophy of those series imo (until now - and I hope that it will contine like this). All those negative comments are probably fake and paid to try to keep the hipe around this amazing attempt to be different in an excellent way from happening but with character constellations like in Picard, the story and the great quality of the special effects, this show is going to be one of the best ever released. Picard contributes positively to to the human mind, encourages the viewer to think about the self and enriches the otherwise pathetic palette of pointless series that only have violence, rage and decadence as their desperate theme. Picard engages the audience on an intellectual level while telling a story that is interesting and captivating. Well done!! I believe that many people like this show but - as very often in life unfortunately - only the haters and naysayers are taking the time to leave a review or rating. Again, thank you for making this show! It's amazing ( even though I believe that the plot with the attack of the androids is a bit rushing forward in the first episode - but I believe the problem was that the time was too short to fit into the required length and there had to be a compromise; it's the only that could be better imo. Otherwise, it's really good. Again, well done! and thanks).","rating":"10\/10","date":"14 February 2020"}

I'm only writing this to suggest anyone who hasn't see this yet who really loved everything about TNG or any of the 'vintage' series, to seriously consider not viewing it. Keep your memories safe, and let your own imagination decide the fate of Picard in history.The show is not Star Trek. It doesn't even feel as if the writers even bothered to watch any of the original series, or take time to understand what it was that made Star Trek unique.It moves at a glacial pace and it's been incredibly boring. I switched it off half way through the latest episode, I was so bored. I'm not a big Marvel\/Blockbuster movie fan, so it's not a case I can't appreciate an understated or thought provoking show, but I do need to see SOMETHING happen from time to time. Talk, talk, talk and then more talk, between not very likeable characters and there is virtually no storyline. Maybe that's why its all talk and big pretty set pieces.All those wonderful characters from the original series are AWOL. 7 now speaks with an American accent. This is just a pay day to Stewart because he has virtually nothing to do.Amazingly it's green lit for season 2. People may stick with season one because of the time they invested in it, but each episode is slower than the last and I'll not be bothering with the rest of the series. There will be a big viewer drop off for season 2.","rating":"6\/10","date":"29 February 2020"}

{"title":"The fans are right, it's not Star Trek","review":"Yes, something new may unfold because of this new series. For the first time in history it's possible that the hard core fans of the franchise would demand canceling the show after season 1.We know that in the past some series survived because of the fans' requests and pressure. It happened with The Expanse, and, to a limited degree, with Firefly. With the last one, the fans didn't get a season 2 but they did get a movie.I've read a lot of reviews and the disappointment is real, clear and it comes from the people who love the Star Trek universe. What is the criticism? No more stand alone episodes. No more exploration of the Universe. No more hope in the human race, hope that what we have now and is bad-like cruelty, careless, greed-will go into remission in the future. No more logic and detached reasoning. No more inspiring visions of the future.What do we want from Star Trek? A world in which the contrast between the future and the present is as substantial as the contrast between our world and the Dark Ages. We want to see an ideal team, formed by people who know how to communicate, respect and value each other. We want people capable to contain their emotions and the worst aspects of their personalities. We want to see how a group of people are capable to solve a tough problem every episode. Solve it with intelligence, diplomacy, creativity, grace. We want to see a group of people passionate about the unknown, Universe and science. We want analysis of moral dilemmas, and yes, like we've seen in TNG, a culture without religion.Fortunately, there are some alternatives for you as a sci-fi fan: Black Mirror, The Expanse, even The Orville.\nUnfortunately, CBS left us with only one alternative: Trekxit.","rating":"3\/10","date":"13 July 2020"}

I've watched every Trek movie, TV series and even the cartoons. This Picard series for me is finally something geared towards adults and much more realistic of what I'd expect from space travel in the future. Not some hokey naive 60's outlook like the many different TV series had. It's ironic people are complaining about the swearing and are probably the same ones that enjoyed Trailer Park Boys or DeadPool. The tiny bits of swearing in Picard are laughable and well done for emphasis compared to any modern movies geared towards teens and adults where every second word is someone swearing.

In less than 4 episodes you actually get to know and care for other crew members and so on.

Picard is obviously run by a committee, and it shows.Picard is a dark, depressing mellodrama chrinicalling some kind of alternate future Picard as he slowly walks to his grave. I find nothing inspiring, interesting or remotely utopian about yet another excuse to create another dark, gritty, edgy parody of Star Trek.It really is a shame Patrick Stewart was cast for this garbage, he's ruined his legacy and it makes watching TNG uncomfortable now, knowing that all along this is the character and world he thought he was portraying.What a let down.","rating":"10\/10","date":"1 February 2020"}

It has nothing to with it apart from luring the fans with bits and pieces of what once was the most awe-inspiring show.Star Trek, by Gene Roddenberry, was all about bringing the best of what humans can achieve, about a future that inspired generations to seek out knowledge through science, exploration and community cooperation. It promoted the idea that the future can be bright with TNG and VOY reaching the peak of this utopian world.Now, CBS threw everything it once was and made another lame dystopic future show. Forget about a bright future. Greedy, wars, drug addiction, money in the first place, division, f* words is all that the future holds. The motto \"Space: the final frontier. (...) Its continuing mission: to explore strange new worlds, to seek out new life and new civilizations, to boldly go where no one has gone before\" no longer applies.Outrageous, disappointing. Star Trek Picard is a continuation of a demonstration of disrespect to the work of Roddenberry that has been happening since he passed away.It's sad to see actors who once were inspiring a generation now putting themselves up to this.And finally, revolting. I, too, was lured into watching this. By bringing actors, characters and memories, I felt like a kid being offered candies by a stranger and then kidnapped. Gladly, I didn't go far. By their forth episode it had already proven more than enough that whatever this show us about, it's not Star Trek.For those who are infuriated by having watched this. I'd recommend to pretend it never happened and it's just one of the alternative timelines that could ever happen if the future were not to be optimistic.","rating":"7\/10","date":"10 April 2020"}
{"title":"Patrick, Jeri.. please consider dropping this!","review":"I loved TNG in the 90's. I loved Voyager in the 2000's because I was able to watch it with my kids who are now teenagers. I watched DS9 in the 2010's and loved it but felt bad I didn't give it a chance much earlier. I even enjoyed Enterprise to a certain degree.But this... this does not feel like Star Trek. The bad language, the obnoxious and whinny characters, not to mention the dialogue.. it is not Star Trek. I'm 5 episodes in and it feels like a bad version of The Expanse, I'd rather watch that.The Raffi character is absolutely generic, playing out the disgruntled ex-military service type, who begrudgingly joins the protagonist. The most irritating aspect about her is that she can't bring herself to say \"Jean-Luc\", too much of a mouthful apparently.Take interesting concepts like the Federation, Borg collective, AI or any scientific idea and don't use them to develop the Star Trek universe. Instead rely on soap opera drama and homogenize the story lines with a good dose of today. Its supposed to be the future, one I would hope to be part of. For crying out loud... the characters interact with holographic Ads... that reminds me of TODAY, all the garbage of today! Why would anyone want that in a Star Trek episode. Part of me thinks the show creators couldn't come up with their own unique science fiction.. ahem, excuse me.. \"syfy\" universe so they'd thought to repackage this one. Well no thanks!I'm taking note of all the producers and writers in this and staying clear of anything else they're involved in congrats.For those objecting to the negative comments. Please, take something you really enjoy, a good recipe, a good drink, a good piece of art or music. Now remove the core thing, the essence that makes it enjoyable to you and replace it with something else. See how you like it.","rating":"1\/10","date":"22 April 2020"}
{"title":"Started out slow but oh boy!","review":"The first two seasons were good but pretty much just ok. Now, the third season was just completely outstanding. The cast still had great chemistry and the writers did an outstanding job. Bringing back so many things form he past and mixing it with the present. In the last episode you go from laughing to tearing up. This was a wonderful way for that generation to go out.The ending leaves so much to create a new storyline to continue on with the adventure. Now there have been other series of Star Trek but this one feels different. With the name Enterprise continuing on it just leaves you with that same feeling you had watching The Next Generation. I can't wait to see what comes next.","rating":"10\/10","date":"20 April 2023"}
{"title":"Let's get down to the facts.","review":"You know there's something wrong in the 24th century when you witness anachronisms like curse words, bumbling spies, sunglasses, escalators, 3D printers, class struggle, cartomancy, vaping and airpods... : )The premises of the Picard series are great. There is a Romulan conspiracy that has undermined the federation's work for centuries, a conspiracy that intensified after the supernova explosion. Romulans don't like androids, we can say that they had their \"Cylons\" in the remote past. And so, Data would be as enemy as the Borg.My hope is that writers will one day read the discussions on social media and try to write better scripts, that's all. I find it sad that the wealth of content in Star Trek is wasted in stupid episodes.A TV script needs consistency, closed end, context. Within such a context you develop the plots and characters. Without all this, we have only a series of dialogues and effects that do not create synergy. TOS and TNG had synergy. DSC and PIC have no synergy.I find it interesting to watch, just like I watch other teen series, but I don't think DSC or PIC it's important to watch. I wish it were as important as TOS and TNG once was and VOYAGER, ENT and DS9 tried to be.I think the renovation of Star Trek is fundamental. For example, the 2009 reboot, I found phenomenal, bringing back TOS with a new look and preserving the chemistry of the characters. The new look in the DSC and PIC are very welcome, but I think the scripts are shallow. They try to reach new heights, but are still below expectations. They jump off Roddenberry's shoulders, but instead of flying they crash to the ground.","rating":"6\/10","date":"10 February 2020"}

{"title":"Ten Stars For Season Three!","review":"Yeah. Seasons one and two don't exist and should have never happened.The Star Trek beancounters ought to see what makes a series with this kind of fanbase excited, and wanting to come back for more.One example: Drama.Ro and Picard have a history of pain and betrayal. They resolved this in a way that would bring a ST-TNG fan's eye water. Their breath falter and hesitate.Another example: Score.Pulling musical cues from almost all of the past Star Trek movies and series, while adding the occasional flair of new instrumentals molded seamlessly with the subject matter, and at the precise time? Things like that are what help to weld scenes into the minds of the viewer.Final (But probably not) example: USE WHAT WORKS!!Jonathan Frakes (Number One) is a well known and accomplished director. Engaging him to direct episodes was a brilliant move.Buy this season, fellow Trekkers.You won't regret it.","rating":"10\/10","date":"22 October 2023"}

Characters and world you know.The bad: action movie mentality, moral themes that lack nuance, REALLY silly action sequences, odd pacing issues, lens flare and a general lack of thoughtfulness in the plot journey.There's a thinky, morally complex, puzzle-solving vibe to old star trek, that is completely absent in the pilot.Better than discovery (so far). The morality has a softer touch than a lot of stuff these days, but still lacks real depth. There's a definite BSG vibe in some ways.Very early to tell though - not a lot happens in the first episode. It's a pilot, so who knows. Could be worth a free trial when the whole show is up, but at this point, probably not worth money.","rating":"6\/10","date":"23 January 2020"}

Just pure brilliant star trek genius...minus a couple of crap and weird things. Picards son is horrible. Regardless of his character type, hes jut annoying and seems like an over priviliged prick, the kind of person who takes pride in sleeping with married women.Apart from that, Season 3 is amazing. So many good and great Star Trek history references. Its pure delightful to fans of TNG, DS( and VOY... Yeah Enterprise is still the worst ST of all time.Anyways, I hope u enjoy it... maybe ignore and dont watch how bad season 1 & 2 really is?The whole cast back is on great acting form, with great advancement of there characters, everything fits so well, and its so good it really makes u forget about how bad the 1st 2 seasons are with there 100s upon 100s of mistakes and terrible story telling.The 1st 2 seasons are like Rian Johnson was in charge. A pox on him and the people behind the terrible 1st 2 seasons of Picard.","rating":"8\/10","date":"1 April 2023"}
{"title":"Such a Sad Day for Star Trek","review":"This is not Star Trek, plain and simple. I join the chorus of reviews stating the obvious...this is not the hope filled future but a grossly reimagined 2020 that I watch ST to get away from. ST is supposed to be about hope and where we can go and it can get dark, I mean look at DS9... or the Borg episodes. But those were just aspects and not the entirety of the story.\nThis is simply awful and not worth watching.","rating":"7\/10","date":"22 May 2020"}
{"title":"What it says about modern times","review":"ST Picard tells more about modern times than about what is Star Trek.When we watched the OS, TNG, DS9 and Voyager and even in Discovery (which was in itself an annoying\/silly part of the Star Trek franchise) is was about ethical conflicts, discovery, morals and wonders, human progress. In general it was all optimistic, the best of mankind, we had a bright future.SF usually extrapolates current times into the future and it is not a pretty sight this time. A morally collapsed government, conspiracies and secret plots, lone wolfs against the government, rich people pulling strings etc, etc. A single man's fight against evil, it is all pretty standard in storyline and action. It has become more a episode of Mission Impossible than Star Trek.It is sad to see that even Star Trek is now gone down with the times.On the good part: it acting and visuals are pretty good, and it is also good to see 7 of 9 in something else than the demeaning catsuit from Voyager.And then it even gets more seasons. S2 is sometimes hilariously bad, plotholes and illogicalities follow each other in a rapid pace and acting even gets worse. Even Picard seems to have troubles remembering his lines.","rating":"4\/10","date":"11 May 2021"}

The interactions between the characters and the little references to the past are just so fun. Thank you TNG crew for bringing us this wonderful show that brings back so many memories. I hope you had as much fun filming it than we have watching it.I wish they would continue this show for another season or two, but I guess it's always best to end on a high note.","rating":"10\/10","date":"14 April 2023"}

{"title":"This is not Star Trek","review":"As with Discovery, this is not the Star Trek Roddenbury envisioned. The setting is dark, gory, profane and disgusting. The characters-- including Picard-- have severe issues. Gratuitous F-bombs are dropped regularly. There is torture and gore enough to make some users turn away in disgust. I lasted until the \"eyeball removal\" episode... then gave up on the series (I should have given up on it earlier).This, like STD, is the Star Trek concept at its worst. They're successfully pulling in an audience by bringing back old characters such as Seven of Nine-- but these are not the characters we knew. This is not the show we knew. This is not an evolution of Star Trek, but rather a de-evolution, a dumping ground of perverse concepts and needless gore.They had a chance with Picard to bring back a Star Trek fit for family viewing, a Star Trek that taught morals and ethics and presented hope for the future. Instead they followed the same recipe that made Discovery unpopular with so many. This is such a shame; it could have been so very much better.","rating":"1\/10","date":"25 February 2020"}
{"title":"This isn't science fiction, this isn't Star Trek","review":"This is an insulting cartoon that ignores science and lore to come up with a hamfisted story to push a deranged political narrative. The basis of the story doesn't make sense, the Romulan star empire is by default not reliant on a single solar system, in fact the lore is that they have around a hundred planets and solar systems under their control. They wouldn't need help escaping a star's extremely slow process of going nova, they are a light speed capable civilization. There are no shortage of home worlds, the milky way alone has 100-400 billion stars and 100 billion planets, \"m class\" planets are everywhere so the forced \"refugee\/migrant\" narrative being forced into Star Trek is simply a non starter.Add to this the rather ridiculous human robot, reminiscent of the recent botched terminator movie and its clear the show has been ruined by the woke. This just isn't star trek, it isn't star fleet, and its just kind of boring as it just assumes we are supposed to care because it waves around bits of faded nostalgia.","rating":"","date":"1 February 2020"}

I just had to come here and tell everyone how much I absolutely loved this episode and this entire season. My heart is still fluttering from the nostalgia and the absolute amazing writing of this third season. For anyone out there who is still questioning whether the show is worth watching, without a doubt you should watch season one and two just to get a handle on things and prepare for the amazing nostalgic trip down Star Trek memory lane that is season three.","rating":"10\/10","date":"14 April 2023"}
{"title":"Season 3 is where it's at.. really good season.","review":"Took 2 seasons of weak, woke trope nonsense to finally arrive at something with a real story, real intensity, actual space activity, and resetting the characters closer to the standard of why they were interesting and entertaining in the first place. As an added bonus, they managed to get a bunch of great characters from the earlier series to pay service, even if only short term. I'm not saying there wasn't good episodes or cool characters here and there in the first two seasons, but it was not good enough to make up for the cringe that littered the majority of the plot lines.. and the actors seemed like they hated it themselves. Seasons 1 and 2 are no match for the entertainment quality of season 3, which feels like a reboot of the series, the way it should have been.","rating":"8\/10","date":"8 October 2023"}

{"title":"Great new beginning for Picard","review":"Someone wrote \"what were they thinking\" because Patrick Stewart will be 80 this year. Well, he still has the Picard character and now even more so fully. I thought he was brilliant. It looks like a great beginning to a fantastic story that most Trekkers will want to see no matter Patrick's age. As a 61 year old Trekkie I remember when Star Trek was in prime time in the 60s as a child. I've loved every minute of every Trek interpretation. But Picard was always my favorite Captain. I'm willing to give this show every opportunity to succeed if the millennials can get on board and get over the \"ageism\" complex. The extra supporting cast are many of my favorites as well, especially Santiago Cabrera from The Musketeers. So I'm stoked about the entire show. I hope CBS will give it a chance and not cancel it midway through. Here's hoping. And thank you for bringing back Jean Luc Picard. May he live long and prosper.","rating":"9\/10","date":"23 January 2020"}
{"title":"Doesn't live up to expectations","review":"It was one of the most highly anticipated series for me in a long time. It was great to see all those familiar faces and the new characters were interesting. Although, the performances were outstanding, and the visual effects looked amazing, the storyline was massively underwhelming. I had the feeling that background stories were not only lacking depth as they were mostly left untold, but my impression is that those stories have not even been thought through. Lots of incosistencies, unnecessary threads appearing without any rhyme or reason. Bad storytelling is what this was. The writers have to make up for a lot in the second series if they want the show to live up to Star Trek standards.","rating":"6\/10","date":"19 July 2020"}
{"title":"They Made Star Trek Stupid So Everybody Can Be Smart","review":"Listen. I'm not some uber Star Trek loyalist who's resiatant to any change whatsoever. I only even got into Trek as an adult, whereas as a kid I thought it was something just for a niche group of \"nerds\" for lack a better vernacular.Every Star Trek show has had it's problems, especially in each of their earlier seasons before they discover what they're going to be.Many people didn't like the newer shows at first, which is understandable since people get attached to the old ways. Still, while they have their problems, each show up until and including Enterprise tried to keep the spirit of what Star Trek is in tact.I mostly blame the 2009 movie which started the downward trend from Trek being a pensive, introspective sci-fi medium, to a nonsensical, hyper-paced, 1990s style mindless action fest, with forced drama and bad comic relief.Trek shows have always messed up continuity, but this is the first era where it seems that the producers and writers have destain for the source material.None of the characters in Picard are even close to being the same people from any ofntheirnorigin shows. You couldn't even chalk up such drastic changes to life experiences. Picard, who was a serious man of science, now talks of \"the stars\" in some nebulous, poetic fashion as if he hasn't been to over a hundred different systems as a Star Fleet captain.Talking of \"the stars\" is something that we do now, because they are such a foreign concept to most people since we don't yet have interstellar travel, but it wouldn't be for someone living at the beginning of the 25th century.And that's the problem with Star Trek Picard. The writers of these new projects don't understand science. Even science fiction has to be based in something tangible so the audience has some reality to be grounded in.A quantum accelerator doesnt exist for example, but we can get the idea from accelerator. It must be a futuristic component. This show just makes up everything as it goes. Anybody can do anything and the tech they need will or wont be available depending on what the script requires at that time. You have things like Picard being turned into an exact android replica of himself to explain how he survives, then it's forgotten about soon after, because the script no longer needs it.Not only do they not understand science, they don't even understand writing. You can't constantly have high tension for everything. You can't replace thoughtful dialogue with pew pew lasers. Nonsensical, non-scientific plots were boring in the older series and they're boring in this entire series. But look! A guy with a katana! Katanas are cool, aren't they? Ya, in a Samurai movie...I've never seen such dumbing down of an audience in my life. If this were a hostile country producing this to make western audiences more stupid, it would totally make sense.The show is an insult. It's an insult to the older fans and it's and insult to new and younger people coming in. If you're watching this as your first experience with Trek, just know that they're insulting your intelligence.These types of producers are incapable of writing popular shows which don't get cancelled in the first season, so they use popular IPs with already established audiences to keep their contracts with the streaming services going a little longer. They are talentless hacks. You've seen them before, or rather the result of their work. They are franchise killers. Terminator, Star Wars, Lord of the Rings, Dr Who, etc etcSome people complain that it's about injecting politics where they shouldn't be. I don't think that's the case. Trek in particular has always had politics. The episodes with the black and white people in the original series as a metaphor for racism was brilliant. I would say, you can only insert politics if you're not a hack and your art is actually good.If I had to say all the bad things specifically, I'd need to write a book. Go back and watch everything up until the movies came out if you dont want your brain to decay from lack of use.","rating":"1\/10","date":"15 November 2022"}

Smart visuals and slick CGI doesn't excuse lack of good storytelling or knowledge of the character. This is supposed to be Picard, not Patrick Stewart or Professor X.

Hopefully, here onwards, we can stay the course. Number One was phenomenal as an actor and director in this episode. He does a lot of the heavy lifting.

Just finishing up Enterprise now.I got into Star Trek through watching Discovery and then I started with The Next Generation. What really struck me about TNG was the message it conveyed to viewers. It was such I stark contrast with other more modern shows I was watching at the time. TNG highlighted human values, it elevated virtues, values and ethics. Doing the right thing, responsibility and discipline, courage and curiosity were just some of virtues that explored. It was a breath of fresh air.That is exactly what I thought after watching the first episode of Picard. 'A breath of fresh air'. Familiar, yet different. Exploring tragedy, yet radiating hope.

It's edgy, brooding and grossly violent, nothing remains from the original show but the familiar faces. I don't care about the f-bomb shock value, but I do care that it's inappropriately dark. Why is this utopia miserable?Add to that the mishandling of season 2; the aimless subplots, horrible pacing and misuse of talent. Honestly, I like these actors (Jeri Ryan's a standout); there's no fault with the performances and with better material, they could be making something fantastic. But this is wildly off-base in tone, intent and execution.I'm a little conflicted because they're promising the reunion of the entire TNG crew next season. But on this show? I don't think I have it in me.","rating":"4\/10","date":"28 May 2022"}
{"title":"Star Trash","review":"This is definitely NOT how I would like to remember the great captain Picard; as a fragile old and weak man ... seeing him in any sort of fight or action scene is ridiculous. What moron thought this would be a good idea? And are they seriously planning a Season 2 of this Major Fail of a show? Will Picard be in a wheelchair and in a hospital bed most of the 2nd season?

{"title":"Season 1, terrific. Season 2, snoozefest, Season 3, good for the most part","review":"I thought Picard season 1 was absolutely great. Then season 2 came, and it immediately put me off with an episode that seemed to be more about Picard's emotional state than, you know, space, frontiers, that sort of thing.Still, I stuck with it. And it had its moments. But it was all just irretrievably dumb. People constantly made bad decisions. Sometimes the series would just drag, or hammer you over the head with a plot device. The entire season is simply poorly written. After 6 episodes I decided I wasn't going to bother to watch the rest. It's just all too dumb.While some people here are whining that season 2 is too \"woke,\" I think it's great to show how terrible ICE is. I like this season's politics, I just don't like much else.Season 3 was, in essence, a new season of TNG. Once again the show was too concerned with Picard's emotional side, and there are some long, tedious heart-to-hearts that made me want to shoot myself, but when that wasn't happening, which was most of the time, it was a fun action-y season that I enjoyed.","rating":"8\/10","date":"24 April 2022"}
{"title":"This, like Discovery, is not Star Trek","review":"Why is it that every time you let Hollywood loose on streaming service with no censors, they have to throw in as much swearing as possible?

{"title":"Even Star Trek isn't immune to the \"WOKE\" idiots littering the TV industry","review":"I've been a fan of star trek for over 50 years, \"inclusion\" was always part of roddenburys vision for the future.\nHaving said that, \"Picard\" has unfortunately become a victim of \"the WOKE Brigade\", these insipid piles of excrement have invaded pretty much every aspect of life, it is most obvious in the TV & film industry, the entertainment industry has been its home for decades now but the stranglehold it has on the serialised TV show & the movie industry is clearer now more than ever before.\nAny star trek fan will tell you, \"somethings better than nothing\" the franchise has been stifled & held hostage for far too long so when the re-boot movies were announced it was met with excitement & anticipation, the decision by jj Abrahams to turn the enterprise into a \"hotrod\" would've made roddenberry puke, even with that awful decision star trek fans were just happy the stranglehold on the franchise was loosened enough for new stories to be told, for the best part it was ok but still not as good as it could or should've been.\nDiscovery was another release eagerly awaited, finally a new TV series, again the \"woke brigade\" was evident and now we have \"Picard\" a much anticipated TV show promising a reprisal of one of the much loved captains in starfleet, only for the 1st episode to be crystal clear it's not about \"Picard\", the character is mearly a \"prop\" used to link this dull extravagant show to the brilliantly imaginative TNG, Patrick Stewart is sadly so frail his physical acting is no longer there, the atrocious script dialogue & amateurish acting from supporting cast offers nothing but awkward interaction in almost every scene, clearly the show has a healthy financial budget, the cgi & physical props, sets & locations are superb, but like discovery the \"woke brigade\" are getting their way, the star is another young female being better than everyone else & contrary to roddenberrys vision, these woke idiots that get their way preaching \"inclusion\" do so at the \"exclusion\" of everyone else.\nI can only assume the reviews on IMBD giving 8s,9s &10s and lauding OTT descriptions of the show aren't from star trek or sci-fi fans but are from \"paid\" Reviewers, I say it over & over again, if you give good reviews to bad TV or film then that's all you will get.\nIsa Briones, Alison Pill,Harry Treadaway & Michelle Hurd are absolutely awful amateurish actors, the dreadful script does nothing to help with covering their inadequate acting, furthermore it makes a brilliant actor like Patrick Stewart look awkward & lacking in acting ability.\n\"Somethings better than nothing\" doesn't mean any old garbage.\n\"Star trek\" is Gene Roddenberrys vision of mankind in the future, real life in a future where problems such as famine, war & racial hatred has been overcome by the human race, where advanced technology is as commonplace as our technology is today, a human race that is united in a belief that everyone is included for the benificial advancement of the human race, that also includes the exploration of space and all the \"alien\" life that is discovered, yet knowing all this the producers fly in the face of that knowledge to do \"star wars\" style rubbish, impossible over the top \"physics defying\" action sequences with lots of flashes & quick movements that belong in a children's silly fantasy story, TV & movies are littered with rubbish like this, these producers had the opportunity to produce a top quality TV show with an exceptional plot\/story\/scipt, god knows they've had the time to plan this but no, what we get is an expensive pile of drivel with cheesy \"power rangers\" style action & a stupid plot about a skinny young girl brandishing impossible abilities, it isn't clever, it's nothing new, it's been overdone in all media including comics & novels, even the new trilogy of star wars movies have fallen fowl of garbage \"wokeness\", \"star trek\" & \"Picard\" should've been protected from these \"gender agenda woke idiots\", so I'll say it again & again till someone finally takes note;\nTHE MORE YOU REWARD WOKE UNIMAGINATIVE GARBAGE WITH OVER THE TOP & UNTRUE PRAISE THEN WOKE GARBAGE WILL BE YOUR REWARD.\nNO, not a review from a \"hater\", an honest review from a real fan of this franchise & of sci-fi in general, support for poor writing, bad acting & woke storylines don't improve anything, they are the \"death nell\" for franchises like star trek, pandering to today's \"woke\" audience doesn't garner \"fans for life\", like everything else they corrupt, eventually the \"woke brigade\" will discard it with little to no care of its future, once they have destroyed it they'll move on to destroy some other loved franchise.\nShame on the IMDB \"WOKE\" Reviewers for false OTT PRAISE, You've already got your nasty little claws into the \"Dr Who\" franchise, leave star trek alone.","rating":"6\/10","date":"24 January 2020"}
{"title":"Understanding The Star Trek Universe Is Key To Understanding The Brilliance Of Picard","review":"February 14, 2020 - I feel strongly that I need to revamp my entire review after watching the third Episode and the Wil Wheaton Shows after each Picard episode. It is made clear in the Wheaton Shows that everybody involved in Picard, from the Music Director, to the Show-Runner, to the Producers, to the actors that the love of Star Trek - The Next Generation is very much a respected and beloved show to ALL of them.Star Trek was envisioned by Gene Roddenberry as taking place in a universe that endeavors to see this universe through eyes that are searching for equality in all creation and ultimately peace as the ultimate solution. Having watched every version of Star Trek except the cartoons, some many times over, there was NEVER any illusion that any species is perfect. Many hateful reviewers in here are NOT truly familiar with the Star Trek format. To equate Star Trek with race hating or trying to shove a particular political belief down the viewers' throats is to truly NOT understand the Star Trek Universe.And yes, the references to a \"feeble\" old man are still setting me off. We have just seen the set up in the first three episodes of what is to come. I lean toward the conservative middle in my personal ideology. But even I understand what Admiral Picard was trying to accomplish when the Romulan sun went nova and his mission to try and save this race, the most hateful, distrustful race of people in the entire Star Trek Universe. ALL of life is precious and to try and save them is noble and shows Picard as he has always been, a man of impeccable character. To watch him wake up from this \"hell\" for him, the Picard Vineyard in France and to try once again at the age of 91 (in the show's timeline, in real life, he will be 80 in June or July) to rally good people to find out what went wrong with Star Fleet 15 years before to suspend the salvation of the millions of Romulans from death at their sun's demise, is to see the Picard from TNG who never gave in or gave up.And despite what has been said here in other reviews about this not being up to ST standards? It EXCEEDS any of the Star Trek shows I have watched 100% and thus my 10 rating. One thing about my rating, though? It is from a Star Trek fan through and through who completely understands what Gene Roddenberry was trying to convey in his conception of Star Trek. I know, in my heart, that this show is exactly on point in the Star Trek world. But more than that, it will resonate with those who have never even watched Star Trek. There is a mystery afoot! And as Star Trek has always tried to impart, patience will ALWAYS be rewarded with excellence.Many negative reviewers spend paragraphs trying to explain how this series doesn't do the Star Trek franchise any good. I see a completely different vision in Picard. I see a man who had been a hero, well respected, highly decorated, who fell from grace because of some nefarious virus that somehow infiltrated the Star Fleet Federation and tried to erase the program of saving the many millions of Romulan enemies from a death they could not escape on their own. And I now see that man find his inner character again, especially with an incurable disease, who decides to right a wrong. That IS Jean Luc Picard!!This is not an uncomplicated series! But then, if you are a true Trekkie, you know that none of the Star Trek universe is uncomplicated. And yes, Discovery is the one that jumped away from everything Star Trek! I KNEW having read many interviews with Sir Patrick Stewart over the years, that it would take nothing but him jumping into the true Picard spirit to bring him back to Star Trek. This man doesn't need the money! He should be comfortably retired, enjoying his sunset years. But look at this fine man. I know, without a shadow of a doubt, that Sir Patrick is as much a fan of Star Trek as the rest of the true fans are. And I know that unless this show IS all things Star Trek, he would never have agreed to play this part again.To keep pointing out the small things like a very few curse words and the untrue put down of pushing a particular agenda or talking about bad cinematography is a smokescreen for people who, for whatever reason, do not want Picard to succeed. So, when I call them haters, I think it fits. And yes, everyone is allowed their own opinion, but when that opinion is two lines of \"this is just terrible,\" I have to question the reality of that reviewer's opinion as whether they have even bothered to watch the show or, as they claim, that they are, indeed, Trek fans at all!In the end, as in the Star Trek Universe, I believe good people will end up winning. I hope enough good people watch Picard and give it a second, third, and fourth season. It's too bad we are even fighting about a TV show! No wonder this whole world is falling apart!!January 31, 2020 - I just watched Episode 2, and after five minutes, it was over. Anybody who cannot see the brilliance of this show, isn't watching it, and isn't a fan of the Star Trek franchise. Star Trek was not always positive and peaceful, there were many instances of war-like stories in every arc of every Star Trek series and movies. But what REALLY burns me up about the hater reviews, are the constant references to Picard being old and feeble. For a man of his age to pull off the intelligent dialogue and the story being woven, which is absolutely believable and brilliant, is to be lauded, not mocked and not criticized. Sir Patrick Stewart still has strong acting chops and still maintains and projects the personality and drive of the Jean Luc Picard I knew and loved for seven years of TNG. After reading hundreds of reviews in here, I suspect there is a concerted effort to bring down this new series for whatever reason that makes no sense to me. This is a cohesive, smart, well written and executed beginning of an exciting story with SO many places to go. Period!! And the ageism in here is despicable. Those who are downrating this series based on Sir Stewart's age? We should all be so lucky to have our facilities and abilities to pull off a character he played 20 years later the way he is. The second episode was better than the first and now we see a story being set up about a covert Romulan sect who might have caused the breach with the synths in the beginning. A brilliant story with intelligent dialogue that is far from boring and is setting up I can already project, a brilliant and fitting continuation of the Star Trek series. For that? I am extremely thankful. STILL 10 stars that nobody asked me to write nor paid me to give to this review!","rating":"10\/10","date":"25 January 2020"}
{"title":"Utterly dependent on nostalgia","review":"Of all the installments of this venerable franchise, 'Star Trek: Picard' is also one. It is neither as original as the original 'Star Trek', nor as fresh as 'The Next Generation' was, not as heartwearming as 'Voyager', and not as complex as 'Deep Space Nine'. Instead, 'Picard' is one thing above all, and that is nostalgic.Unfortunately, nostalgia enough doesn't make for a good series. The first season lived entirely on the fans' desire to see their old heroes again, and yet Patrick Stewart's aged shoulders did not manage to prop up the show all by themselves. That the second season exists is something that best be ignored by everyone who likes decent television.The third season, finally, is Star Trek again. We get a proper Federation-style starship with a proper Federation-style bridge and crew, with properly campy enemies and an overly melodramatic plot. We finally see the crew of 'The Next Generation' reunited (and also Seven of Nine, because everybody loves Seven of Nine).We get a final episode that is truly excellent, a beautiful farewell for everyone we learned to love over the last decades. We also get nine episodes that are reasonably good yet still flawed.When the entire series revolves around reassembling a bunch of characters that have been retired for long, long times, the plot must unfortunately be somewhat contrived, not leaving a lot of room for logic.Imagine, for example, that you are the captain of a starship which finds itself in a dire situation (a staple of the franchise). Who do you assemble in your meeting room to brainstorm solutions? Is it (A) your trusted senior staff members who are educated on cutting edge procedures, or (B) some old dudes you actively mistrust that haven't been in the loop for decades? In virtually every episode of past series it was A, yet now it must be B, for this show is not named after a space ship but after one of those old dudes.It does quite often feel jarring to see our aged heroes in situations that honestly should be handled by people at least two decades their senior. This was true for William Shatner in the last few movies involving Captain Kirk, and it is even more true for this show.It doesn't help that our old heroes seem to have lost their common sense along the way just as much as their junior colleagues.Still, I cannot deny that the nostalgia works. However, without knowing at least the basics of 'The Next Generation' and a smidgen of 'Voyager', 'Picard' would be an unholy mess of cameos and unfamiliar retirees running around for no apparent reason. Even if you do know and love those decade-old series, it is an absolutely understandable choice to watch only the third season of this show. If you consider yourself a true and hungry fan, perhaps watch the first one as well. I can't think of any good reason why anyone would want to bother with the second. It certainly isn't needed to understand the rest, thankfully.Now go, watch in awe and cheer for your old heroes one last time, before utterly forgetting every last detail about this nostalgia-laden stack of mediocrity.","rating":"7\/10","date":"27 August 2023"}
{"title":"The dummies guide to destroying a series","review":"It started so well. It promised so much. It was different. It was somewhat mysterious and it provided nostalgia to trekkies. That pretty much sums up most of Season 1. Season 2 did not start well and kept going in that direction at warp speed. It was nk longer different, the mystery disappeared. The \"seriousness\" of what was initially portrayed became farce with the numerous attempts to add comic aspects to a series that was succeeding with only a bare minimum. The directors of Season 2 clearly didn't watch Season 1, did but didn't care, or were lobotomised. Congratulations on the light speed with which you have managed to destroy the great potential promisednin Season 1\nIt is truly amazing. I cam only think it was deliberate in some way because I don't think anyone that cared about the series could possibly be capable of such destruction.","rating":"3\/10","date":"26 April 2022"}

S3 now warrants Picard a 10. The seasons couldn't be much different - so much fan service in S3 - expecting DS9 to be in it!!!Great performances from the original crew + 7of9 - Jack, Sydney and Shaw are brilliant additions to our favourites.Check it out and if you want just watch S3 as a stand-alone and come back to the other seasons!","rating":"10\/10","date":"26 March 2023"}
{"title":"My rating just went from 2 to 9!","review":"I'm going to leave my review of Season 1 below by way of contrast. I didn't even bother watching any of Season 2, the reviews were enough.Am I nostalgic for Star Trek TNG and is this colouring my view of this Picard series? Yes, but why? Because, among other things, TNG represented a positive view of the the future of humanity. The characters had depth and you got attached to them. In my view, Season 3 of Picard rescued the miserable mess that was the previous seasons. This is the way things should have ended for Picard and company. Season 3 isn't perfect, some things are a bit of stretch, however overall, it was masterfully done. Original story, great special effects, really decent script, not entirely predictable.I started watching TNG as a teenager when it first aired in the UK in 1990. It caught my imagination then, and the old magic returns with Season 3 of Picard. It's not often I get emotional about film and TV, but wow, episdoes 9 and 10 really did it for me. Patrick Stewart, you have redeemed yourself!My 2 star rated review of Picard Season one from earlier below (the former title was \"Hoping Q will appear in Season 2\")Though I'll have to wait for someone to tell me if he does, because I won't watch season 2 otherwise. He could save the Star Trek universe by announcing that this dark, dysfunctional future was only a possibility and lets us all return to the TNG standard we loved so much.What is good about this series? Stunning cinematography, a decent story in itself (a welcome variation on a bad guy with a super weapon trying to destroy the earth and Starfleet stopping him but at great cost). The scenes with Data, Riker and Troi were all satisfying.What's not to like? Plenty, unfortunately. Messed-up, dark characters who don't seem capable of bonding with each other. Torturously long story, with numerous really boring episodes as a result. A Romulan intelligence agent who looks and sounds like a final-year London architect student, and his sister, played by Peyton List, who did a decent job in the CW series Frequency, but who is awful in this. F-bombs (must we?). A Romulan Ninja who can't decide if he's Steven Seagal or Forrest Gump. A neurotic scientist who alternates between being all teary and vulnerable to murderous and deceitful.I loved Star Trek Next Generation and engaged with all the main characters, especially Picard. I was surprised to find myself not caring when he died in this series and actually being disappointed at his resurrection.It would have been great to have Picard in proper command of a Starfleet vessel again, with a crew we care about and who bond with each other.Star Trek TOS, TNG, Voyager made us feel optimistic about the future. A homicide detective once wrote to Patrick Stewart to say that after a hard day dealing with the worst aspects of human nature, he would come home and reach for his TNG box set to make him feel more positive about humanity and the future. The poor guy might be a statistic himself now if he gave this a go..","rating":"9\/10","date":"8 May 2020"}

When the announcement of the release of the new Star Trek Picard took place, I waited for a long 2 years, literally counting the days until the premiere. And then the day of the premiere came and I excitedly turned on the new Star Trek. After watching the first episode, there was a strange feeling - What was that? Is this an old track? I quit watching after episode 5. This is terrible. Script, music, story, acting and even sound! This is all terrible. I was very surprised to learn that Jonathan Frakes was the director of this show. I have a feeling that in 2020 I found myself in some kind of alternative reality, where everything is terrible, even the new Star Trek!Season 3 - Perfect - 10 rating\nThe season 3 was stunning!

{"title":"Second look, after initial giddiness","review":"Let me preface this by saying I'm a lifelong Trek fan. I have a license plate with the shield on it which I acquired at the 25th anniversary, several cars ago. Patrick Stewart is marvelous, no matter what. That said, there is a much more drab atmosphere which, while in keeping with the intended storyline (I'm guessing), is a shock to the system. The criticisms about human-like Romulans is valid. Grumpy Grandpa also. And please, writers, stop following the unappetizing trend of branding something as \"grown-up\" or \"edgy\" because someone swears unappetizingly. I really hate that and avoid many vehicles I would otherwise watch (or spend $ on at the theater) because I'm sick to death of the debasement of the English language with perpetual and mindless ugliness. Shakespeare had some of the most incisive and devastating insults in all of literature and, surprise, he didn't use nasty, ignorant verbiage to do so.

It just goes to show, how wonderful the writing was on ST:TNG, it made him look good. My heart goes out to Gene & his legacy of hope, I can only image what he'd think if he were around to see this rubbish. I've missed him greatly since his passing, but not at this moment, I'm glad he's not around to see this abomination. Anything ST made with the Kelvin timeline, is not worth your time watching, sadly.

I have read 2 of 3 comics (countdown) and they help a little.I think there will be enough 'fan service' to keep most people happy, without being over the top.

{"title":"Good actors shame about the story line....","review":"There's a certain irony, not to mention circularity, when the only way to \"hopefully\" produce a decent Star Trek series, is by revisiting actors from an older, successful series, from the 1990's.Star Trek: Next Generation like most of the spin off's that followed, in that period, were pure gold. They inspired hope, using the possibilities presented in a science based future that \"might be\". A future ruled by reason, kindness, inclusiveness and learning, to progress humanity, in spite of many challenges.Small wonder utilising the actors from this series, such as Patrick Stewart, is a smart or perhaps desperate move in itself? That said, it shows up what an abject failure the new series, Discovery, has been to date. A failure I believe because it embraces a warlike capitalist ethos, poorly concealed beneath a reedy, lecturing, politically correct hypocrisy, that is at odds with the Trek universes philosophy, of cooperation and sharing.So what to make of the new series? Having watched two episodes, I'm done. Patrick Stewart is a fine actor but what I personally view as questionable scripting is, in my opinion, sending this series down a similar path to Discovery. Lots of PC posturing. Thus far its the tired old stick of diversity, pseudo feminism and multi-cultural-ism being waved about. As to the story itself, frankly I for one find it antithetical to the concept the Star Trek universe is based upon with Picard turning against the Federation. What's left is weak, condescending and uninspiring.4\/10 and only out of respect for the 90's actors. They are wonderful but the writing here, in my opinion, is anything but.","rating":"4\/10","date":"26 January 2020"}

I just wish the season had 26 episodes and not a pitiful 10.

{"title":"One Of A Very Few Shows Which Peak In Their Final Season","review":"No spoilers. I'll only say that Season Three has turned Picard from a six out of ten into a eight out of ten. And judging Season Three on it's own merits, it's a solid ten out of ten. Not just collectively, but on an individual episodic basis.Where the show is set to end is where it should have began. What we've witnessed is essentially Season Eight of The Next Generation. It's been wonderful seeing the Next Generation crew back on screen together in something other than the individual cameos offered up in Season One & Two. Proving Trek at it's best is greater than the sum of it's parts.If this is where it ends, then what a way to bow out. But should Paramount perform a u-turn and announce Season Four i'll look like i've slept with a coat hanger in my mouth.","rating":"8\/10","date":"14 April 2023"}
{"title":"Boring","review":"I like ST a lot. Basically watched every movie and series several times with the exception of Discovery which I am not going to watch again. Also played some of the video games and listened to tapes and CDs :-PIn Picard, we've got a boring pseudo-mystery story which doesn't get me hooked at all (doesn't happen very often).\nThe characters of the main crew feel like a video game party. The super skilled \"warrior\", the super smart scientist, the mysterious captain, the troubled drug addict\/thief etc. they feel insanely clich\u221a\u00a9 and none of them is interesting. They are rather annoying and boring.\nSome episodes are quite horrible - even with some kind of cringe factor.\nDoesn't feel like the ST universe I used to know.\nFor the story lines.... I don't know. There is not a lot of science and not a lot of fiction, but a lot of personal drama and soap opera like interactions and drama between the charaters... I'm not really interested in that. I'd hoped to see some philosophical, ethical and moral questions being addressed as well as some adventure like story. But apparently that's not what the show is about.\nI turned off the TV in the middle of episode 5 as I could not stand it anymore. This does not happen very often.On the plus side, there is some fan service here and there with familiar characters who show up or are being mentioned and one dialogue was decent...Sorry, but you can do better. Patrick Steward, JL Picard and Star Trek deserve better.","rating":"7\/10","date":"8 March 2020"}
{"title":"Third Season - True Trekkies Dream","review":"Like the title said - The Third Season of Picard is something all of us - the old school Trekkies - waited for decades...\nThe true Star Trek the way it was ment to be made...First season was something different - some new way was exploredSecond season was very strangeBut the third season is superb Star Trek show that I would like never to end.Great work with third season Picard!Disclaimer: I waited for all of third season to show and then binge watched it. It was great fun and joy. Old gang made the one more ride with the Enterprise and at the end gave us a hope that there might be a new spinoff with more story to tell.","rating":"10\/10","date":"4 May 2023"}
{"title":"Season 3 finally delivers","review":"So this is weird, after two false starts (that had moments of looking promising but that ultimately failed to deliver) now it seems they've returned to their roots and voila - a decent show.It's a bit sentimental, rebooting the old gang, but with this story they've got going in Season 3 it actually works. And this is so much better than being stuck in Picard's mind with his mother (wow!).The golden rule is that nothing really works properly if you don't have a decent plot and story - and this story is sufficiently sneaky and amorphous to actually work. Added to that the script isn't half bad - and the baddies are really bad, so we can get behind our protagonists - and there is seemingly quite a lot at stake, so we have elements of the heroes journey thrown into the mix.As this is the last season, it's fitting that they came up with something worthy - but more than a little frustrating that they didn't dig deeper for the first two seasons.At the end of the day it's a 7 not a 9 - nice try though.","rating":"7\/10","date":"6 April 2023"}
{"title":"Why...","review":"Season 2 had some much promise. The first 2 episodes had the fundamental elements of what made TNG so special...including a spatial anomaly, Q, Picard's past, the space-time continuum, a test of humanity etc...but it just goes downhill. I really tried to love this after episode 3, hoping the blunders if Season 1 would be corrected. Didn't happen. It's so boring...Picard looks weak and lost, the other characters are not likeable, I honestly think I could have written and directed this better...just being a fan if the franchise. Thank heavens for Strange New Worlds...amazing.","rating":"9\/10","date":"13 August 2022"}
{"title":"Diversity for the sake of diversity, neutered males.","review":"When did Starfleet become a girls club? The male characters are all weak and whiny. They hold no positions of authority and Picard gets constantly pushed around. I really dislike the show.The characters do not draw me in to their story or cause.

{"title":"A mediocre show and pretty terrible Star Trek","review":"So many fans wanted to see a show about the Federation rebuilding itself after the Dominion War and rediscovering its moral and cultural center, and exploring the struggles of reforging its alliances.. Instead we got a show that further attacks the heart and soul of the franchise. Rather unfortunate, honestly.Picard is a show that, rather than reviving Star Trek and breathing fresh air into an old idea, takes it further down the path of dystopian science fiction, focusing on tired subject matter and cheap action to drive it forward rather than focusing on providing good story telling, interesting characters, and deep exploration of the world around them.STP is a very flawed show that had all the potential in the world, but didn't apparently have the talent and vision behind the scenes to make it work. The tone is all over the place. The writing leaves a lot to be desired. And the plot is pretty much recycled from any of the many other shows about secret organizations and terrorism that have been made in the last couple decades. They had a whole universe to explore, an endless number of good choices that could have been made, and they chose to focused on interpersonal drama, terrorism, and secret plots. So very boring and unoriginal.The camera work can get pretty bad, too, as can the acting and dialogue. Half the time it feels like they are trying to force a response from the audience that the scene isn't naturally providing. I simple conversation with overly dramatic music, for example. Or a scene with odd camera work that doesn't feel right.Picard has its redeeming moments, don't get me wrong, but they seem few and far between. Mostly it's a pretty juvenile show. Patrick Stewart often feels out of place in this off-kilter version of the Star Trek universe they have created, and unnecessary to the story. Certain scenes they have chosen to include are downright cringe worthy, in fact.Of all the directions they could have taken the franchise this seems like one of the worst, and it is unfortunate. I can watch the older shows time and again, yet found myself struggling to get through this show even once. It is just so unoriginal. So many other shows have explored these subjects and told this story, and done it better. Star Trek deserves better than this.I very reluctantly feel obligated to give this show the score it deserves 5\/10. Passive entertainment with few memorable moments and a lot of creative issues.","rating":"5\/10","date":"28 June 2020"}
{"title":"Are you kidding me? Just watch season 3.","review":"Update: Season 3 is really much better. In fact, just watch season three and skip the first two seasons.Do any of these people giving this absolute rubbish a positive review have any idea about the premise of Star Trek!?I am a fan of Star Trek TOS,TNG and to some extent the Rick Berman era of trek, but everthing about this series (2 episodes in) is a complete mystery to me.Its as if the writers have not even looked at the history of the star trek universe, or maybe brushed quilckly over it and come up with earl grey tea and Picards endless friendship with Lt Cmdr Data, which is just not the case.A stain on Roddenberry's vision.","rating":"","date":"31 January 2020"}

I loved it, makes you smile cry reminisce. It's perfect, things you don't see nowadays. It maintains what star trek next gen was\nAnyone who gave up like me after the first season, please give it a chance you will definitely not regret it. Takes you back and makes you value the things you have now,your family. This made me happy and glad I watched it .wish there was more, but looks like there wo t be and that's OK ots has closure and if there is more (maybe 2 more seas9n to make up for the first 2 that shouldn't exist) I'll be more than happy to experience it :)","rating":"10\/10","date":"14 July 2023"}

That was fun to watch for a while, but please, that's like Alice in Wonderland and it gets really old, really fastI much prefer this new ST Picard, much more believable and in phase with our Human imperfect condition ... sure, it could be even better, but so could have been the first season of TNG, just to cite one example!I'm new here, but by no means a fake account - Yes, I love this show and I give it 10\/10 - the only show right now that I care to follow every week.","rating":"10\/10","date":"13 March 2020"}
{"title":"Seems a little derivative and cliched","review":"The story as of 5 episodes in is based on a man looking for a girl and a retired man building a crew to take on a mission. I was really disappointed to see this boring and overdone story. The story is also moving very slow, which I normally wouldn't have a problem with, but there is nothing of substance happening. Slow building unfortunately does not equal thought provoking or meaningful writing in this case.Picard goes to a Romulan planet, and gets himself in trouble. That guy who refused to join the team earlier, guess what he's going to do? Huzzah! at the last second he saves the day and the plot moves forward. This has happened with two different characters. Character has a bad history with Picard, and refuses to join his team. Moments later the script says they have to change their mind and join, so they do. It's uninteresting writing when you can predict just what is going to happen next, and trust me you will be able to.","rating":"6\/10","date":"21 February 2020"}

{"title":"I can't pretend this is set in the future","review":"Okay, sure, for budgetary reasons I get why they used an actual building for Starfleet Headquarters - I can even look past the folded aluminum doors that were clearly manufactured in the 21st century. Shows have budgets, we want some big space SFX, I get it. Still annoying, but I get it.What I can't get past is the bizarre anachronisms. Seriously, one of the characters just said \"Pro-tip\" as in \"Pro-tip: using early 21st century slang in a show set hundreds of years in the future is transparently poor writing.\"Also, drug use? Really? So I guess we're going with the \"everything sucks lol\" dystopian view of the future that completely contradicts the entire premise of Star Trek in the first place. Awesome.This show really gives off the impression that it's about 60% fan-service and so far, I haven't gotten enough of a sense of what else this show is trying to accomplish.I'm trying my best to not be disappointed, but I keep having to try harder with each new episode.","rating":"6\/10","date":"8 February 2020"}

{"title":"We\u00ac\u00a5re getting the band back together","review":"Some 20 yrs after Star Trek Nemesis, Admiral Picard is leading a quiet life on his family estate, Suddenly a woman comes rushing on his property and the game begins. This is a series so I won\u00ac\u00a5t be detailing the following stories but rather the context of the serie. Jean-Luc is drawn in to action once more; not unwillingly. This is also at the heart of all three seasons in many ways. Quite a few fans seems to think that Star Trek has fallen into the same trap as Star Wars in some ways, but I disagree. Where as Star Wars portrays our old heroes in a way that\u00ac\u00a5s seems a bit (or more) out of character for them I argue ST Picard does not. Yes Jean-Luc is indeed not as he powerful was all those years ago and as he comes across old friends they too has changed. The point is they all have changed in a way that seem... organic, natural. Also they are still very much in the forefront and not some old fossiles sulking in the backround.For me it has the fingerprints of Sir Patrick as well as Jonathan Frakes who has directed several episodes and Sir Patrick is a producer as well.I will acknowledge that it took a while for me to war up to it but now I\u00ac\u00a5m glad I stuck with it.","rating":"8\/10","date":"22 March 2023"}
{"title":"Overall, a disappointment.","review":"Season 2 update:\nStarted out promising but quickly turned to boring family flashbacks, useless dialogue, cheesy romance, extremely stupid in-your-face contemporary politics (a smart and proper Star Trek would've set up a sci-fi allegory on another planet to make its political point, but there was no one smart writing this one) and several scenes of pew-pew. This season is a disgrace. The only consistently good part of the \"Picard\" show is ironically dr. Jurati, both character subplots and actress performance. I would be perfectly OK with renaming it \"Star Trek: Jurati\" lol. Beyond her there are very few good parts, mainly the ones where we find out some creatures we already knew about could do things or have things happen to them that we never thought possible, pretty much the same types of good points as season 1, again just thrown in there and put to very little use.Season 1:\nOnce I accepted, based on the trailer, that this would be yet another dark and conflict-focused show, I did like what they came up with as the focus of the conflict, because it was a new type of being, which is good for a \"Star Trek\". And I allowed myself to be pleasantly surprised by how they used some of the old ST technology we were used to in some new ways (like for a certain fight scene).But beyond that it's been disappointment after disappointment, and I haven't been able to watch most episodes without some fast-forwarding. First of all, most of the character writing and acting is bad, everyone's \"too cool for school\" and throwing snappy replies all over the place, just like the totally obnoxious characters from Discovery. Picard himself is unrecognizable, there's no ponderous and dignified attitude anymore, he never wears the uniform, no longer stands up for Starfleet's high principles, instead runs around with some ragtag band of misfits, which is completely un-Picard-like, and worst of all he's the focus of some strange \"Picard Cult\" the writers have created INSIDE the universe. WTH is that?! There was never any premise for that in TNG. He was just one of many Starfleet captains with healthy attitudes and principles, there was no reason to make him out to be this VIP that everyone knows about. He's a great hero for US THE VIEWERS, not in-world! It's very tiresome to keep seeing characters give all kinds of extreme reactions on finding out who he is, that was never what Picard was about - being a galactic rock star.Really the only likeable character in all this is dr. Jurati, because she has some realistic non-superstar modesty and is well acted. The main female character, while she does have some humility, is not well acted at all, the actress they picked does not have enough emotional range, even though she's almost passable because at least she's not acting like a superstar all the time.And while I fully expected there to be some throwbacks and a conversation or two about the good old days, it turns out that there's almost no episode without some sitting around the table scene, having a boring conversation about how things used to be and irrelevant stuff that happened in the past that does nothing to move the plot forward. This is just bad writing.Then on the tech side they also failed to make this a \"Star Trek\", with the most annoying part being the ship interfaces, which have nothing whatsoever to do with the LCARS we used to know. I could forgive the fact that they went with this popular stupidity going around these days of making the GUIs transparent and therefore unnecessarily hard to read, but they could have at least preserved the general \"okudagram\" look, to make them feel like \"real Star Trek interfaces\" to us TNG fans. But no, they threw that part out as well.Bottom line, there is no trekking, nobody's seeking out new life and new civilizations (we're practically served the new life on a plate in the first episode), and this is not Star Trek. Thank Seth we have The Orville, which I can't wait to see continue.","rating":"7\/10","date":"28 March 2020"}

Even if this show had some semblance of a good storyline, you wouldn't know because getting through a single episode is painful.Not only does this show disappoint me in every way it possibly could, it makes me sad that we truly won't ever see another Star Trek show that captures the magic of Star Trek.","rating":"2\/10","date":"8 May 2022"}

Forgive me for not remembering exactly, but they use phrases like \"Scour the Earth\" and \"Destroy the world\" etc. Like, it's the 24th? Century? The federation is massive, shouldn't they be saying \"Let the Galaxy Burn\"? \"Scour the Universe\" you know, on a grander scale than just one planet?It just bugged me enough that it made it hard to really believe the characters were themselves, the original show wouldn't have made that mistake and I'm surprised any writers let that through.","rating":"9\/10","date":"12 April 2023"}

Each episode was great the storylines knocked it out of the park.We have been looking for good scifi tv to watch that didn't toss in ppl and situations that weren't politically motivated in any way.

Best storyline and the best acting is in this season. Season 1 and 2 are slow in pacing and are political correct. Which is a problem with more shows these days.When it was first announced I was thrilled seeing Picard again in a new series. But I soon lost intrest after seeing the first 5 episodes. I watched all the episodes of the first season hoping that at the end it was getting better. It didn't.Next season it will get better I told myself.Season 2 came along and it was a little bit better but not too much. I still wasn't committed to watching it every week. Stil a slow pacing and a storyline that didn't connect with me. What I liked about this season was the return of some familiar face's.Then Season 3 came and it is a different ball game now!Didn't except that!It feels like a proper show now. Much les political, better pacing, better acting and a much better storyline! I'm committed to watch every week now! Can't wait to see the next episode! This is what you want to see in a show.

{"title":"I really wanted to like it...","review":"Sorry, I've gotta go with the negative nerds on this one. I love Star Trek. I'm an old man, and I watched TOS episodes as a kid. I shushed my kids during new TNG episodes because I couldn't wait for the video tape to watch it. I watched DS9, Voyager, the films, the cartoons- I even broke down and watched \"Enterprise,\" just to get the monkey off my back. (\"Way to kill the franchise, Bakula!\") And Discovery- never mind.\nI've put up with a lot over the years- walking around with 'Robot Commando' Spock, searching the universe for his missing brain, whiney Captain Janeway and her heroic poses, watching a hot Vulcan go topless for ratings, or Tom Hardy in a lovely evening gown, goofy-looking Klingons in Elizabethan armor, and so on. But I love Star Trek, so I put up with it.\nNow someone has turned it ugly. In episode 5, I am expected to watch a man get his eyeball drilled out of his head and listen to him screaming all the way through it. I don't want to see that on any show, but on Star Trek it makes me feel betrayed. I want to watch ST with my grandsons. I don't want torture and sadism featured on my favorite show. I'm willing to suspend my disbelief, put up with bad writing and gaping plot holes, listen to rabid and thinly-disguised moral or political agendum, even see some of my heroes fall. But suddenly the whole ST universe is dark, and the future is no longer hopeful. Is the world really that way? Sure. But that was the appeal of this alternate universe- its overall message was, \"things will eventually be... okay.\"\nIf you guys want to make an edgy, dark sci-fi drama, fine.

This has obviously hurt the feelings of some who want a return to episodic story telling and a problem of the week show. This is not it. It's a slow burner giving you a little bit of story each week with a splash of nostalgia. The writing is above par although there was a few moments even I had to raise an eyebrow at but all in all it's solid. If you liked discovery you'll like this as they're very similar in aesthetics and build towards the final episodes the same way.

{"title":"WOW!!!!","review":"This production looks and sounds amazing, in ways The Next Generation simply could not for its time. Additionally, it is a wonderful continuation of Jean-Luc Picard's story, that in the first episode alone demonstrates that Picard is unwilling to betray his own moral principles, even if it means living in a life of isolation and depression. Picard does an amazing job of giving Patrick Stewart the same kind of latitude to explore the character and make the same powerful Picard-esque soliloquies and speeches TNG fans came to love as part of his character.\nBecoming involved with Dahj immediately ignites a flame within Picard that very quickly re-ignites the spark we have all come to know and love from the good captain. Based upon what we have already seen it is quite clear that this story, is going to take Picard to places he, in his solitude; and us as fans could never have expected - and I look forward to seeing the rest of it!!!!","rating":"10\/10","date":"23 January 2020"}
{"title":"Season2 pales in comparison to Season1","review":"Other than the last episode of Season1, I thought the entire thing was quite good. I didn't mind at all that it didn't \"feel\" like any ST before it.So far I've only seen the first 6 episodes of Season2. The writing is definitely worse. It has descended more into \"continuity porn\" - making references to other ST elements just for the sake of exciting fanboys I suppose.Speaking of continuity, they can't even get THAT right when it ought to be included. In ST lore It's established that by the late 23rd century time travel can be achieved by a starship (The Enterprise A does it in The Voyage Home. And the Enterprise E does it in First Contact, and it's just considered \"a thing we can definitely do with our regular starship engine\"). Yet here they lament the fact that they can't do it without somebody as brilliant as Spock doing the calculations (there's that continuity porn again) - but oh wait, there's also the Borg Queen who's smart enough to do it. So THAT becomes the justification for letting her be part of the crew, and who will be necessary to keep around to go forward in time again to return \"home\". That's just super sloppy writing.Alison Pill (Agnes Jurati) and Michelle Hurd (Raffi Musiker) are the best actors and characters on the show. There is some especially GOOD writing with Jurati's character. Well, except for the part where the band magically accompanies her to a song she spontaneously sings. That crap is \"musical theatre logic\", which has its place in the fantasy of a musical.Patrick Stewart seems to be playing it all rather one-note. There often seems to be that \"desperation\" voice he does.EDIT: After watching all 10 episodes of Season 2, it seems my review above might be a little too kind! Yes, it got worse.EDIT: Season 3 has been excellent so far (I've seen the first 6 episodes). I am reminded how good TNG got starting in Season 3 too, but there wasn't anything so terrible in TNG's first two seasons that was as bad as Picard Season 2, or at least if there was it didn't span some multi-episode arc.","rating":"6\/10","date":"10 April 2022"}

Season 2 started great but got pretty lame after the 3rd episode, it felt like they were stretching and filling up until the last 2 episodes. I had high hopes for season 3 and boy I couldn't be happier, as I write this review we are 6 episodes into season 3 and I'm on the edge of my seat every single episode, the writing is so good the story moves forward and a good pace and bringing in the entire TNG crew back was a master move at best! Season 3 is the modern star trek we all wanted to see, it's 100% canon it hits all the right notes and having those nostalgic moments involved with a great story line, bad ass villains and all that with Legacy characters that are doing a fantastic job, just sublime! I just couldn't be happier, hopefully there will be a spin off that keeps this momentum going, and keeps the franchise in the 25th century where it's supposed to be. Don't get me wrong, I love SNW but I don't care for the timeline that it's in, I mean how many kirks and Spock's do we need? It's time to move on.","rating":"10\/10","date":"23 January 2020"}

{"title":"turned off after 5 mins of season 2 episode 4","review":"So, season one was bad, but watchable, then season 2 came and it mega woke right away, i gave it a chance, since after watching and loving peacemaker, which was also a bit woke, but also was a very good show.So as i said i gave picard season 2 a chance, now the normal bad stuff, like lazy writing, people dragging picard around because hes to old now, i can deal with that stuff, the the mega woke political correctness started which again, ive seen it before since this left wing ideology has infected almost everything, i can take a bit of climate change, a bit of 'facism bad', a bit of anti authority\/police stuff, but in season 4 they directly attack ICE and call them assholes etc, i was genuinly quite shocked at it, they could of made up a diffrent name, and have a dig in a subtle way, but they chose to use the real world name, i dont care what your polictics are, these are law enforcment officers who are doing a job to protect and serve the country.

{"title":"Season 3, you will be assimilated","review":"As most reviews state seasons 1 and 2 had promise. Some ok characters but tbh did you really care if any of them coped it. Stewart had to try and do something different but it wasn't quite rightTHEN SEASON 3 CAME....Wow wow, data, riker, worf the old crew and some unexpected ohhh and just watch episode 9 spine tingling. In my opinion the characters who remain from season 1 & 2 still struggle to fit, Severn of nine was somehow included in this, ok ok I'm being really really pickyIf you loved TNG you'll love this. So much better than all that alternative universe rubbish. It also makes up for all the mistakes made in the 09th star trek film.","rating":"10\/10","date":"3 May 2024"}
{"title":"About a dog...","review":"This first part is about the first season. Please do scroll down to see what I have to say about the second season. It might be worth it if you're a Trekker \u201a\u00f2\u00f9\uf8ff\u00fc\u00e8\u00aaSo, what can I say... than right down wonderfull! The first episode hints a promise of this being the first series since The Voyager worth the legacy of Gene Roddenberrys creation: The Star Trek -saga.After the first season of Discovery, I honestly thought this is the end of it. We are never going to be able to go back ro our innocense after the travesty of Discovery showing it's ugly balls and cnt. I never saw the rest of the series and I still can't comprehend why the show wasn't cancelled after the five first episodes, if not for the money spent and the money earned. Star Trek it was not; it had the name, it had some of the looks, but it was a totally different reality with a cheap Star Trek -skin on it. I could puke for less...\nBut this review is not about a massive failure. This review is about \"a new hope\" (\"pun\" intended). It's about the true love for SF that brings the positive aspect of hope for our future to our fingertips, almost physically touchable, just as Roddenberry would have wished and wanted.The first episode of Picard brings us back to what really matters in life; careing for one another, without prejudice, letting all people be themselves with their believes and minorities and what have you, as long as they don't harm each other.Make no mistake, this is a new, darker take on TNG -continiuum. But it's beautifully placed for the time and space we live in right now, with the righteous Roddenberryan mindset sizzleing through around every corner.Then again, it wasn't perfect. Had \"The Number One\" been The Siberian Husky or a St. Bernard, instead of a fight dog, I'd given this 10\/10. You just can't have it all, can you...\nI recommend this from all my heart and sense to all of you true Trekkies and Trekkers out there! The \"force\" of G. R. has returned ;)P. S. Maybe they made Discovery so bad to ultimately promote this??? Well, it's working and it's beyond!!! (At least after seeing the first episode of Picard.)P. P. S. After seeing the whole first season... Ihave to take back much of what I wrote above.So, read on. It's probably worth it....Edit after seeing the first season and now into S2E6:The first season turned out to be too dystopian for me as a Trekker. It just went from darkness to darkness after the first episode. It wnt from \"promising\" into \"Discovery\", if you know what I mean...Now, watching S2E3, it's kinda lightening up!: The goodies ARE goodies without some silly backwards plot you can't trust on, and they ARE for real fighting the baddies.And that is the new \"new\" after Discovery -BS.Sure, there's still this dystopian darkness, but when the good guys gather around to make it right...There's the distinction of love that surrounded the series from the beginning, in the 60's, something you, as a Trekkie, can look forward to, the hope for better tomorrow where we MAYBE, and just maybe, can live together as a one human race on earth, and as several races when aliens are included.Since, when it comes to racism, there is a common consensus between scientist: human race is a race of it's own separated from other living species on earth; therefore the idea of racism is something of a human innovation, and in it self not true at all.Well, well, the rant (true blue though), but if the second season keeps developing as it has so far... Imma give the series one more star, makiong it 8 all and all, as I took two of them stars away after seeing the entire first season.Star Trek is supposed to be somewhat naive giving us hope for the better future. Period.","rating":"7\/10","date":"25 January 2020"}

Another dragged out, boring, serialized plot line, this time ripped off straight from Blade Runner. More R-rated violence, swearing, and scenes of people doing illicit things. Heavy-handed politics. This doesn't even feel remotely like a continuation of the Next Generation, it's basically a derivative new sci-fi series starring a politically disgruntled Patrick Stewart.All right. Maybe, since I like Star Trek, I'll eventually watch more episodes and then update the review. Until then this is the impression I have of the show.","rating":"2\/10","date":"5 May 2020"}

{"title":"Trek thought through","review":"It's quite apparent that gathering all the scattered pieces of Star Trek legacy around one centerpiece was difficult. Though the stories and characters gets tangled and excessive the main plot of each season was solid and nourishing. Marvellous visuals to keep audience engaged with this intergalactic theme. Great audio effects and use of music too. Tremendous hardwork by the cast revisiting and rekindling the past episodes. Sincere performances by the cast in this deep dive into Picard's character. Though it was slow burning at times the third season definitely stands alone. Star Trek Picard is a delightful space drama.","rating":"7\/10","date":"17 April 2024"}
{"title":"Patrick Stewart...Truly extraordinary","review":"I had some reservations about Star Trek Picard as I'm not a Discovery fan but Stewart's performance is absolutely outstanding. This episode in some respects scores highly because of his stellar acting performance. I don't think it's an exaggeration to say that it's some of his best work in Trek.I nearly cried when he said in his dream to Data that he \"didn't want the game to end\" and I felt so sorry for him when he said shortly afterwards \"that the dreams are lovely, it's the waking up I'm beginning to resent.\" Simple lines in themselves but Stewart imbued them with level of sadness that only the finest actors could create. Stewart's acting in those moments is on a par with McConaughey in Interstellar when McConaughey's character is watching the pre-recorded tapes of his family. It's that good.Stewart is by far the best actor to have ever graced Star Trek and it shows here. Having said that, there are some very good performances from other members of the cast.I must also say that top marks go to the special effects team...they're outstanding and are the quality you'd expect in a feature film.So in conclusion, I was surprised by how good the first episode was.","rating":"10\/10","date":"31 January 2020"}

{"title":"Who is this for?","review":"It's too dull and forced to be a good drama (and it's characters are too shallow and one-note, including Picard himself), it's too slow and full of itself to be a fun action spaceopera, it hasn't any original or interesting ideas in order to be a somewhat \"serious\" sci-fi TV show, it's too dark and angsty to appeal to TNG fans and it's simply too dumb to be a new DS9. In my opinion, nobody should waste their time swallowing this tripe. Watch The Expanse instead.","rating":"4\/10","date":"21 February 2022"}
{"title":"Stop always badmouthing everything","review":"I can hardly believe the negative reviews here. I've tried to understand what's going on in the minds of the viewers who are tearing this series apart like this. In the end, all I can come up with is that it's part of today's mentality to badmouth and criticise everything. I read a lot of reviews here, not just on this series, hardly any film\/series gets an 8, 9 or even 10 in the rating anymore. I grew up with StarTrek and love \"Picard\", it's exciting, the cliffhangers drive me crazy and I'm thrilled to see all the \"former heroes\" again. There may be a hint of nostalgia, but in the end everyone has to form their own opinion. For me, Patrick Stewart (just like Jonathan Frakes) is and remains a childhood hero - which he has refreshed in this series.","rating":"10\/10","date":"3 March 2023"}

Better yet end the whole thing with Harry Potter magic including a magic wand. 'We've been having trouble with the Kzinti'?? Pathetic.

It feels like many of the reviewers just want a reboot of TNG but the stale format can no longer carry the franchise. This is a great show which is told in a current format.

{"title":"Whatever it is, it's neither Star Trek nor Picard","review":"Yes, there's Picard and yes, there's guest appearances of old crew members here and there but that's about it. No Enterprise, no trek across the stars of significant scale and Jean-Luc Picard shoved to the sidelines without carrying any meaningful responsibility nor excercising leadership.Instead, we have a ragtag crew of drunkards, a biologist suffering from borderline personality disorder, a female pinocchio and a kid with a sword. The convoluted story of the whole first season revolves around a topic that would maybe span two episodes of \"normal\" Star Trek episode. Meanwhile, they throw in so many flashback scenes, further slowing the pace and dragging out the story to a point you really wish they'd finally get it over with already.The writing of the whole series is so unexciting, you don't even feel the need to watch the next episode after the previous one ended. And thus, the writers rely on unfunny one-liners and throwing the viewers small bones in form of guest appearances.And what does the inclined Star Trek fan do? He's hanging on from episode to episode, hoping for the \"Star Trek\" to begin - but it never does. Which is a shame, considering the production value and overall quality of the cast.So, whatever Kurtzman's and Stewart's vision for the second season of the show is - I hope it takes us back to the universe we all love so much, because right now it's neither Star Trek, nor Picard.","rating":"4\/10","date":"25 April 2020"}

People have to remember, this is not young Picard from 30 years ago. He is both an old man in reality and in the story.Great world buildingThe writers clearly know trek. There are tons of easter eggs and connections to past episodes.In general its very impressive that they can take the disaster that was Nemesis, and the Star Trek reboots destruction of Romulus and turn it into a complex and interesting future story line. This is without any retconning.Now to all the negative reviews, about 100 people (1% of the total reviews), many who have issues with women and people of color, have upvote bombed all the negative reviews so they appear first. 85% of the reviews are 8 or above.","rating":"9\/10","date":"7 February 2020"}

Mediocre job performance should not be accepted on big-budget projects. Everything about this show is sub-par. Acting; C+, Directing; C-, Editing; C, Sound; D+, and Writing; D-. The only thing not border-line failure is the Production CGI - - but they seem to spend on surperfluous scenes that don't advance the story line. I can ignore the many incredulous mistakes, IF the plot flows. It doesn't, the whole thing makes me cringe. I have already predicted the next 5 or 6 episodes and will check back to see how they managed to make a clich\u221a\u00a9-like farce out of the rest. I had eagerly awaited this series, I watched the 3 episodes that had been pre-released for review, and then I felt ill. It gets an overly-generous 6 stars - but that is for effort. 2 stars for execution.

All the people (including Stuart) whom Kurtzman engages in their projects do the same - they urinate on cakes, on Star Trek. They are not ashamed.

{"title":"This is not Star Trek.","review":"All of the actors are good. Some are excellent. Too bad the script doesn't do them justice. The 6 stars are for the actors, not for the story.The history of the characters is far from accurate, as if, whoever wrote this wasn't aware that there have been several Star Trek series and films, which should lay a foundation for this. ...Or they simply didn't care. This seems a solely commercial enterprise (pun intended). They wanted to cash in on the Star Trek fan base. The first season was, let's say, acceptable, but the second was really boring. Both were way too long and drawn out. Not sure if we can expect anything good from the third, other than some more cameos of beloved characters. All that happened so far could have easily been presented in two or three episodes. No need for 2 seasons. Definitely no need for all the bad psycho-drama.I love Star Trek and my favourite, by far, is TNG.I love watching Patrick Stewart. I would watch him reading the Yellow Pages. Captain Picard was my favourite in TNG, alongside Commander Data.I watched ST Voyager, mostly for the Doctor and for Seven of Nine. This says a lot, since the rest of the Voyager cast were really unpleasant.I was looking forward to Picard. I started watching, expecting it to be different. However, the difference is shocking to me. This has nothing to do with the Star Trek world, other than names and locations. That warm, utopian world I knew and loved is gone. It is difficult to watch.There were tough times, darker episodes, in all the past series but we were always left with hope, the future always seemed bright. Star Trek Picard is depressing.I understand the storyline, kinda... If they would have made something different and not pretended that it's Star Trek, not used the name and the context, it would have been so much better, less disappointing. It's simply unfair to destroy a fantasy world created through all the ST series and films.To finish on a positive note... I was happy to see Picard and Seven and some of the old Enterprise crew. I really missed them. They were what I expected and that is entirely thanks to the great actors playing them. Almost despite the story.","rating":"7\/10","date":"19 February 2023"}

{"title":"Star Trek for the 21st Century.","review":"Many are criticising that Picard is too different from the Trek they grew up with. Well, things change. And Trek especially Needs to change, if it is to survive and remain relevant. Nostalgia of a lost era is one thing, and a show like The Orville can get away with it as it doesn't take itself too seriously and has its tongue placed firmly in its cheek. But demanding things stay the same to satisfy a longing for a lost youth is another.Picard is an older Trek, in style and in its titular character. This isn't an episodic exploration series, where the rest button is hit at the end credits. This is a science fiction novel about a broken man fighting to put the pieces of a broken world back together. The halcyon days of the Federation's golden age are over. Paradise has grown indifferent to the struggles at the fringes of its anointed borders. Yes, Star Trek has taken modern day concerns and plays them through the prism of spaceships and aliens, just as it has always done. But now with the style and sensibilities of modern TV dramas.Gene Rodenberry has passed, and that means people no longer get along just fine. That means actual Conflict between characters, and actual drama. Something the Next Generation seriously lacked.Picard is a flawed human, in the winter years of his life, and no longer the dashing Horatio Hornblower in space we looked up to in our youth. His values have been challenged. Everything he has dedicated his life to defending seems to be falling apart, and no-one cares. The galaxy is a dark and dangerous place, where life is cheap and plot armour won't protect you anymore.The stakes are high and the threat is real. Thank the gods, yes. Things have changed.Star Trek, for all its success, never really achieved great drama. As a syndicated TV show, with a few exceptions it generally played it safe. But in the new age of TV, with cinematic filming, broad storylines, and complex character development, Picard has taken some risks to tell a different kind of Trek.My only issue is the pacing of the series. CBS would have served the show better had it been released in full, rather than weekly. Than viewers could watch it a they would read a novel. There is a lot going on, but at the speed of one chapter a week it seems to drag more than it should. Now, half way through the season, when you're able to watch the episodes back-to-back, there's a lot more momentum.No, it's not the Star Trek we remember from our childhoods. But not is it the confusing and disappointing Discovery. This is Trek as legitimate drama, not space opera.","rating":"9\/10","date":"6 March 2020"}

But somewhere along the way I become more of a realist and less of a left-leaning idealist.\nHowever, every creator is free to do as they please with their creation. So I learned to distill the learnings from the Star Trek shows.\nBut this new Picard series brings the worst in JLC from my point of view. He's old, and lost his fighting spirit.\nOverall the production quality is great but the story telling and almost all characters are annoying and glitchy. The only interesting ones are villains - and that says a lot for a show that relies on trekkie nostalgia and the charisma of Patrick Stewart\/Jean-Luc Picard.","rating":"6\/10","date":"29 February 2020"}
{"title":"Nothing redeemable here...","review":"Each episode is a marvel of sloppy, uneven, wrongheaded filmmaking, so full of hubris and a desperate need to be liked that it manages to communicate exactly nothing. Ever-decreasing returns. Stewart is barely present. The supporting cast all noise. But more than anything else, the writers here misjudge the most basic allure of Picard as a character - Picard is a moral and just professional who uses reason and compassion to solve problems. The insistence on ascribing these layers and layers of personal regret and rambunctiousness as a form of superficial nostalgia is cheap and untrue. What's more, it's dull. That would be a problem even if the scripts made sense. Instead, we get a formless mess - a series of call-backs and nasty little shocks that presuppose the audience's commitment to a mood rather than a story. But that mood is constantly shifting, highlighting ridiculous violence and inconsistent characters as \"NEW!! But the SAME!!\" Every goddamn trope in the book - Borg Queens, time travel, nonsensical Q plots...ugh.The TNG cast getting blackmailed into participating in this mess is the real injustice. Stewart's folly in \"Picard\" is embarrassing, but exactly what one might expect of a twilight paycheck.

Is this so? In some ways, yes. For instance, through three episodes, it has avoided promoting divisive social and political views. But in many ways, this show couldn't be more different than its predecessor, Star Trek: The Next Generation:1. It's physically darker. Almost every scene so far is set at night or in the dark, creating a tense, foreboding atmosphere. TNG used warm, brighter colors to create a familial and optimistic environment, even in the depths of space. That environment established the show's world as a place we wanted to visit every week.2. The story itself seems darker. The stories in TNG were generally uplifting. The enemy was often defeated by empathizing with it, negotiating with it, or by the crew working together to reason a way out of the situation. So far, this season's story just involves a superior ship chasing and trying to destroy the heroes' ship while all the main characters fight each other. It's often so unpleasant, which leads to the next point.3. Characters and relationships are unpleasant. Every main character is in conflict with another, and a number of them are angry and sullen. Take Captain Shaw, who seems to always be angry and snarling at someone. The same with Jack - cynical and bitter. Even Picard has bitter exchanges with Beverly and Riker. As for Raffi, bless her heart, but the woman needs therapy. She has to be one of the most unstable Star Trek characters in the show's entire canon.Why is everyone so unhappy in the future? Because TV writers believe that good drama needs conflict. Fine. But how do you depict that conflict? TNG established a peaceful future where mature characters developed warm relationships with each other, and wasn't that show successful? Those characters fought their challenges, not each other, and many of us loved it for that.4. It loves violence. Star Trek: Picard seems to enjoy depicting as much violence as a TV-14 rating will allow. Through three episodes, we've seen disintegrations, impalements, beheadings, sucker punches, and big, concussive phaser and torpedo blasts. Most of these come with sharp crack and boom sound effects that make them seem extra destructive.On the other hand, TNG marginalized violence. Battle scenes were efficient, never lusty. Phasers, the series' main firearm, barely resembled a modern weapon and were usually used only to stun. This underscored the show's focus on a peaceful future and showed that people of that future valued human life.5. It loves swearing. Characters swear in anger or frustration throughout each episode. The writers likely feel this makes the show grounded or realistic. But in TNG, swearing was rare. Yes, this may have been due to television standards back then, but it supported the idea that people in that world were at peace.So what's the verdict on this show, Star Trek: Picard, season 3? Is it better than the previous seasons? Probably. But is it some bold return to the old TNG and its unique values? In terms of tone, atmosphere, and outlook, the answer is no - that show barely got made even 30 years ago, only then because of its powerful creator, and the likes of it may never be seen again in this sad world. So continue to enjoy the old series, which was unique, and boldly held out hope of a bright, peaceful future for mankind. And keep looking forward to a future full of hope and peace. TV writers may not believe in such a world anymore. But I do.","rating":"","date":"10 May 2020"}
{"title":"Season 3 is like a different show, if you disillusioned by S2 give it a try I reckon","review":"The difference between this and S1 & S2 is really amazing. I actually found the first 2 seasons ranging from meh to actually quite boring.But this is actually good TV. I'm intrigued by whats happening with Beverley's son, and the S3 enemy is giving me kind of Cylon vibes from the BSG reboot - not knowing who to trust etc.This actually feels like a pilot for a new series and I think it would have worked even without the TNG gang in it - but they are in it and its great, seeing all the (literally) old faces - its a bit of a love fest to TNG in that aspect but it doesn't seem tacky or shoe-horned in (to me at least).I wish we had three season of this rather than the last 2 yawn fests.So I've given a few hints at whats happening, I would come back to this if you stopped and if haven't seen any, I might even consider skipping S1 and S2 and coming straight to season 3.","rating":"8\/10","date":"1 April 2023"}
{"title":"Thankyou!","review":"Great series, I would watch anything with, Patrick Stewart. Picard is my favorite Captain, even over the Dear to my heart Captain Kirk, that I grew up with. Add to that season 3 with the cast of STNG, as well as Seven of Nine from, Voyager ( my second favorite series over even the original), and you have an amazing show, a true joy to watch and experience. The acting is top notch, although I would expect nothing less from these people.Star Trek: Picard, because of Patrick Stewart, takes my mind to a very happy place. Add to that the rest of the cast. And Overload!Thankyou: Patrick Stewart, Jonathan Frakes, Brent Spiner, Marina Sirtis, Gates McFadden, Michael Dorn, LeVar Burton, Whoopi Goldberg, John de Lancie, Tim Russ, and Jeri Ryan.

{"title":"They got it right in Season 3!","review":"First the fan girl part of me has to gush with the reunion of TNG. I stopped watching Picard in the middle of season 2 because I just lost interest. Then I heard that season 3 was amazing. So I watched, expecting to be underwhelmed. On the contrary, this was not just an opportunity to bring back old favorites. It was an exciting plot with great acting. Using some of the best characters, Raffi, and 7 of 9, introduced in seasons one and two and some great new additions like Jack Crusher, Sidney La Forge, Captain Shaw Just to name a few. The acting was amazing. The chemistry of the old TNG cast is back. Ed Steelers is a stand out as Picard's son. And all this talent was given an outstanding script and amazing great sets, music and special effects. Wow what a pleasant surprise! I was all in by the end of the second episode of season 3. I think they hit it out of the park!","rating":"9\/10","date":"15 April 2023"}
{"title":"last season improves","review":"Jean-Luc Picard (Patrick Stewart) has been forced into retirement on his French vineyard after the Romulan incident. The Romulan sun exploded and Picard had tried to organize a rescue fleet. His plan collapsed after the synths attacked Mars. A ban on synths is instituted. It's years later and he is bitter with Starfleet's path when a young woman steps into his life.This ragtag group assembled around Picard is a bit too random. Take the space samurai. His sword really bothers me. I hate this prop. Seven of Nine is also here. Her relationship with Picard was always a bit awkward. Sure they both have the Borg connection, but she was brought on Voyager as the sex kitten injection and he was the stuffy leader of TNG. This show is too much remember this, cameo that. The characters are all weirdly their altered self. It's badly written by people who know the material, but don't have the restraint to keep discipline. A small example is Guinan who has a bar with the address 10 Forward. That's a writer who's trying to be too cute. It's somebody throwing an Easter egg at my face and expect me to enjoy the bruising. The show feels like a jumbo of abandoned story ideas being jammed together. The first two seasons are a nostalgic mess.The third season is a good improvement. The characters are back in their proper reality with some acceptable progression. It's a good clean-up job. Dr. Crusher is probably the furthest from the show, but her character has a lot of plot in the intervening years. I'm not sure about Amanda Plummer. I certainly understand the nostalgia for Christopher Plummer. She's great on her own rights. Something is off with her performance. As this last season develops, there are some issues. The restraint is not always there. It is still much better the first two seasons and it's nice to end on a high note. The show seems to be suggesting a new show for Jack. I do have issue with that, but the actor seems good.","rating":"6\/10","date":"21 April 2023"}
{"title":"Way better than I'd expected.","review":"In these days where returns, reboots and long standing shows all seem to be going down the shoot, Picard does the reverse, I watched a few episodes and totally enjoyed them, this has been a huge surprise as I was unsure what to expect.Patrick Stewart is as brilliant as you'd expect him to be, but the major triumph has been the writing, very, very impressive, couple in some terrific supporting performances, insane production values, and you have one amazing watch.There is a good deal of mileage in this show, and I feel sure the quality will silence some of the doomsters.Excellent, glad I took the day off. 9\/10","rating":"9\/10","date":"23 January 2020"}

{"title":"The only thing Star Trek about this is the Star Trek in the title","review":"I wad excited to watch the most iconic Captain in the whole Star Trek legacy but soon found out that the only thing that was Star Trek about it was the title \"Star Trek\"!Patrick Steward was not a shadow of the legend \"Jean-Luc Picard\" he was in The Next Generation. Gone was the bold, confident Captain of the Enterprise and replaced by a disgraced, old ex-admiral.The entire premise of the story relies on one of the worst timeline splits in Trek, creating a whole new divergence from that of the final episode in TNG, where Picard was aided by Q to save the entire human race from never existing.The Romulan supernova desecrates the canon worse than JJ Abrams and Discovery, and renders Picard a weak, feeble old man living of the mercies of made up new empty characters, and a mere passenger on a ship not the Captain.Do yourself a favour and don't watch this.","rating":"1\/10","date":"18 June 2022"}

{"title":"So much talking","review":"In my opinion the first 5 episodes are all just setup and could hardly hold my attention. I am a Star Trek fan, but 5 or 6 episodes just about getting a cybernetic woman was boring. No real world dilemmas, no personal relationships, just a bevy of new characters every episode that focus on one mission.TNG was great because it dealt with issues. It also had other characters to balance Picard. Frankly, Picard by himself is not balanced and boring without other strong characters. In this series they just do his bidding.","rating":"6\/10","date":"1 April 2020"}

{"title":"Not much not to like","review":"It seems to have gotten so much better! The one drawing point for me is the emotion which has been instilled in this season. If you have any history of viewing Star Trek the Next Generation you can relate to the emotional interchanges of the characters in Season 3. When faced with possible death but with time to open their hearts to each other the cast gives command performances. The sharing of joys and regrets was some of the best acting experiences I've had to opportunity to witness in any Star Trek episode or movie. Only The Wrath of Khan rivals it in any way. But who could discount the death of Spock as being anything less than emotionally devastating to experience?","rating":"9\/10","date":"12 April 2023"}
{"title":"Picard finally gets it right with Season 3","review":"Rating Picard is much like rating two entirely different series, the original and the reboot. Here's how I would split them up:Season 1 & 2: Picard OriginalMy star rating for the first season of Star Trek: Picard would be a 5-star, maybe. The season was mostly forgettable, and the story arc didn't leave a lasting impression. The supporting cast was lackluster, and I remember Picard's ship more than the characters.I nearly abandoned Picard altogether. But, the trailer for Season 2 seemed interesting, so I decided to give the show another chance, and it fared a bit better with a 7-star rating from me. Season 2 ended almost as a series would end. Saying goodbye to all of the dreadful supporting characters we met in Season 1. Each character had their own path, that thankfully was not along the same path as Picard's.Season 3: Picard RebootAh, finally. The Picard I had hoped for. Season 3 jumped into warp speed earning my 9-star rating for the series. The season brought back beloved characters from The Next Generation, and introduced new ones that fit much better than in previous seasons. The story arc was multi-layered, the tone was dire and each episode was gripping. Brent Spiner and the banter between Jonathan Frakes and Michael Dorn provided some funnier moments.Amanda Plummer's turn as Trek's big bad tops her father's (the late Christopher Plummer). In fact, her performance has got to be the best of any Trek series or movie.Bottom line: Skip past Season 1 and 2, and set a course for Season 3. Engage!","rating":"9\/10","date":"2 May 2023"}
{"title":"Home was lost to the homage of that time in space.","review":"When you hear people say \"it's just more of the same,\" it always leaves me with the sense of wonder, if those \"same\" people are the ones who refer to shows that they were expecting to be the same as they knew albeit differently. It's not what it was or it's just not such-n-such in reference to the show that they were ultimately expecting to see renewed is usually the remarks that are forced upon the reluctant recipient.Having transported now nearly all his time & life through space respectively. The once mighty and affluent Jean-Luc Picard is presently earth bound and in a retiring stoic state mostly due to an accident that has afflicted his interactions with the real worlds he used to know. During an interview about his past transgressions an outburst erupts & ignites his path to reconnect with the faculties and factions he fought along side. This breach of his exterior leads him on his new path with a sparsely set trial left to his subconscious by his old non-human friend Data. Through an interactive coherent dream, coincided by an interruption of one of the androids daughters who is also a hyper-improved albeit illegitimate form of Artificial Intelligence. Seeing that Jean-Luc is now a much envisioned old man he must enlist the cohorts of a past and present to uncover an alien conspiracy within the federation he loved so dearly.This role fits Patrick Stuart well hinting at his age prominently adding an enlisted sense of his spherical simple stoic side much as he did in X23 with Hugh Jackmans belligerent spent wolverine. A few old faces from alternative time lines and a whole host of new interesting ones who inherently semi-remind you of some fragment of a previous trek. Sharp deep & wounded if a little charged figures mixed with dark new wonderful characters have this mellow-drama\/Sci-fi action take on a new premise for a Star Trek series, television has boldly gone to where no man has gone before this just happens to go that extra light year or two. As homages come and go and new tv shows emerge in to a golden age were reminded that age isn't the distortion or the distraction it once was. It's now a guide to which we are only too eager to move forward with and far beyond.","rating":"8\/10","date":"14 December 2020"}
{"title":"Just watch season 3","review":"The first season is a desecration of Star Trek, reducing beloved characters to shades of their former selves. It's soulless and utterly bereft of any redeeming qualities. However, season 3 is much, much better and will restore your faith in Star Trek. The old crew come back together for one final adventure and although its over sentimental and leans heavily into nostalgia, I forgive it because it's trying to give the old crew the send off they deserve. In the cynical world that hollywood has become, its nice to see a show like this manage to turn things around and leave on a high. If you love TNG, watch season 3.","rating":"7\/10","date":"22 January 2024"}
{"title":"Season 3 is FANTASTIC!","review":"Picard Season 3 is so good that I had to come back to IMDB and update my review. My original review below still stands for seasons 1 & 2. But season 3 hits it out of the park with the original cast!This is just as good, if not better than The Next Generation. It's a great story line. The actors are all crushing it in their roles. There are many call backs the original series and some surprises. Why did it take the show's writers and producers so long to give us this???Season 4 maybe?---- Original Review ----Originally rated 4 stars.Star Trek has always been about great character development which made us follow their story lines intently. The show would comment on current issues but in a metaphorical sense. Each show stood on its own with a beginning and ending mini story.Unfortunately with the Picard series those days are long gone. Picard is a 10 show season long mini-series with lots of filler in between. The characters, if they hang around long enough, don't inspire.I get that Picard is retired and much older now so we're not going to see the old Picard leading a Star Ship. That makes sense to me. But where the writers took his story arc by the end of season 1 is beyond reasonable.As far as the woke agenda some reviews talk about, yes there is some of that also in season 2. A statement is made about a particular group of people that is clearly based on lies and misrepresentation. Why would the writers do that? They did nothing but push 50% of the audience away.This is Star Trek in name only. There's nothing about Picard that reminds us of what made Star Trek so popular.On a positive note, regardless of storyline it was nice to see some of the old characters in action. Hence, why I gave at least 4 stars.","rating":"9\/10","date":"15 September 2022"}
{"title":"Almost 2,500 reviews!!! I can say anything I want!","review":"Some reviewers complained about language - cursing. I think I heard 2 or 3 curse words at most. I can't imagine, this day in age, getting prissy over that. F-bombs included. Get over it.They complained that it wasn't Star Trek - and did it in all kinds of acronyms. NO, it isn't the original ST (see what I did there?!!) - It's a new series based on it. There will never ever be another original Star Trek - and the Trouble with Tribbles. So if you're going to complain, don't watch anything made after the original! Give us all a break!!Now - about this one. It was fun to what, but, yes, it got a bit schlocky. A bit long. Elnor was a great addition. Santiago Cabrera aka Rios is refreshing and handsome. Alison Pill is just that. And if you don't love 7 of 9 no matter who she loves, well, you can get outta here!Now on to Season 2 - to see what awaits. Maybe an edit or two. Or not.Whatever happens - Enjoy it for what it is and who's in it!Season 2 language is a bit salty. It does seem a radical change and a lot of it doesn't seem necessary, but..... If I don't want to accept it, I'll go watch Disney.I hate to say it, but I agree with some of the other reviewers. I am not thrilled with Season 2. The story is convoluted at times - especially when it evolves young Picard. I don't think that part was at all necessary. It could have been told quickly and cleanly in a maximum 5 minute segment (and I do mean maximum).All that said, Agnes turned into a bad a$$!! Holy crap!! She certainly evolved, didn't she!!??Some reviewers slammed Q. You can't slam Q!! He's the Star Trek Bad Boy!! And he was EXCELLENT in Season 2.

{"title":"Star Trek? Hardly. Fire Kurtzman now.","review":"While some are falling over themselves slobbering this show with praise, I, a fan since 1966, will not. Trek started to go downhill with the rushed into production, Voyager, continued the tailspin with the tepid Enterprise, hit a terrible bumpy road with the mostly unwatchable Kelvin films, and is now being destroyed by this fool Kurtzman. Discovery, with it's dark, crappy storyline as well as a non existent sister for Spock, one of the dumbest ideas in the history of Star Trek, and another unnecessary prequel, we have the boring Picard. CBS is in this just for the money, while Kurtzman seems to think his foolish ideas and ignoring of Star Trek history make his stuff great. Wrong. The lens flare, the cursing, making the Romulans this honorable people - stolen from the Klingons - making the federation a bitter alliance who turn their back on the Romulans. Picard is the only one left with a conscience? Ridiculous. As for bringing back Picard, why is CBS so afraid to do something truly new? An entire new cast. Go into the future rather than making prequels, reboots and retreads? Bring in a guy like Manny Coto, who saved the 4th season of Enterprise and fire Kurtzman. He's the Zack Snyder of Star Trek. Bring back a direction for the franchise and point it into the future where it belongs.","rating":"1\/10","date":"18 February 2020"}

What have they done? It is depressing with low toned mono log. I had a lot of hopes for this one because Picard has always been one of my favorite characters.

Where do I start?We all used to look to Star Trek as something go guide humanity, and we used to lookup to Captain Picard as a role model of good moral stature. He taught me a lot on how to treat others. Picard used to have a Firm, but Fair persona on the screen that was so well respected by his crew. I used to look up to him a lot.Today, he's an idiot without a back bone. He's lead around by women all the time who constantly berate him, and speak down to him.I don't know about you, I'm getting really tired of this empowered woman, and idiot male junk on tv.

It is so much, that i had to look occasionally away from the screen. It physically hurts my eyes.The title song is just a cacophonic whirl of instruments playing in a random order, there is no audible theme in this title song. I still can hum the title song from the original (good) Star Trek series of the last century and even Enterprise. There is nothing to remember from this title song. It is just a generic orchestra play, probably generated by a computer program.This show is not worthy of being called a STar Trek show in my opinion.

{"title":"Star Trek for grown ups","review":"I have read most of the reviews here, including the ones written by those who saw all of one episode. The move away from a crew based utopian \"we can solve everything in 45 minutes or less\" to a more personal exploration of the effects of age, retirement, zeal and a sense of righteousness was welcome, from my point of view. It is a 21st Century Star Trek exploring inner space, not crashing around negotiating treaties and shooting \"bad guys\". Star Trek has always focused on current issues, and a sense of determining our individual place in the universe is high in people's minds today. I have enjoyed the series, look forward to the next and do not subscribe to this naive view of problem resolution that many of the earlier series subscribed to. DS9 remains a favourite, but even many of those episodes now look woefully simplistic. Bring on Season 2 and let's see where it goes.","rating":"8\/10","date":"3 January 2021"}

{"title":"What a turnaround!","review":"Star Trek Picard has somehow managed to do a complete u-turn in quality. Season 1 was a dull, plodding adventure in which Picard didn't feel like a key character and was simply there because Patrick Stewart agreed to turn up. I haven't watched the second season in its entirety but most say it's even worse, so I don't think I have missed out on much. Season 3 is fantastic, the band coming back together for one final, high stakes adventure full of twists and inspiration not to mention love and care for the lore of Star Trek.Season 3 aims to right the wrongs of modern Trek. Everything down to how officers address each other on a ship to the portrayal of Picard himself, it feels very reminiscent of The Next Generation with just the right amount of earned spectacle we've come to expect from Modern Trek. Every character is done justice, the whole TNG crew are given satisfying ends and arcs with my particular favourite being Data and Brent Spiner gives arguably his best performance as the character. All the performances are top-notch. The new characters are also excellent with particular props to Todd Stashwick and Ed Speleers.This season is full of fan service and it is, for the most part, earned and done in new and interesting ways. The new antagonists are pretty good and the ultimate reveal of their plan and who their working for while feeling familiar, heightens the tension and is done in new exciting ways. There are some gratuitous moments of fan service that is simply there but those are few.Overall, as a whole, Star Trek: Picard is the epitome of a mixed bag. A fantastic third season likely doesn't wash the sour taste of two bad seasons. Yet, I highly recommend people check out the third season as it is all a Trek fan could want. It gives me hope that there could be more good Trek going forward if the right people are in charge. You do not have to watch the previous seasons to watch season 3, it is what this show should have been.","rating":"7\/10","date":"14 May 2023"}

How did this get through the powers that be. The writers political agendas. They didn't try to hide it. Police are bad, \"got rid of hoods to wear suits\". Everything now is hopeless. After the 4th episode I had it playing in the background while doing other things. Just wanted to see how it ended. Really like Patrick Stewart but this season was bad. Other reviews have nailed it. I gave it a chance but it's the writing that is messing up current movies and shows. Having to shock viewers or put personal agendas in the shows. Use ideas already done in past shows.

{"title":"Not anything like TOS: But that doesn't mean it's not good.","review":"So people are saying this is not Star Trek. Well It is Star Trek, just different and from a different perspective. I for one think it's great we finally get to see what Earth looks like in Picard's time. All we ever see in most Star Trek shows is from the perspective of Star Fleet and not what the rest of humanity is up to. This is refreshing.(note) Read a few reviews that said this isn't Star Trek because Picard is not on the Enterprise, and that humans no longer had TV, or TV shows (and) - this is just bad writing and the writers must know nothing about Star Trek. Humans still have TV in Picard's time. They had it in Kirks time too. We know this because in the movie Star Trek Generations there are news reporters and documentary crews, and TV show people filming the crew of the Enterprise before her relaunch. So, yeah...humans still have entertainment in the future. As for Picard no longer the Capt. of the Enterprise. He is old and retired...so stop hoping he gets his command back - it's not going to happen in this show.Also, other reviewers seem to take issue with the fact that humanity in this show seems to have abandoned every thing the old Star Trek told us about how humans have become more enlightened in the future. Excuse me, but we only saw things from Star Fleets perspective...there was more to humanity that was rarely if ever explorered in the previous shows. Star Fleet was not all encompassing...there was and is more to the Federation than just Star Fleet. It's about time we see what other species, and humans do that are not in Star Fleet.I for one look forward to seeing where this show goes.","rating":"8\/10","date":"4 February 2020"}
{"title":"Not New Trek, Not Old Trek and not a trail blazer","review":"Sadly the beautiful premise of the aged weary Admiral voyaging between the stars, seeing old quests and stories with nee eyes and a new crew fails to deliver.TNG is my Trek, and I can not reconcile that this is the same captain, as even with TNGs high mixed and moral high ground rhetoric there was a sense that the characters were acting fairly naturally, Picard see characters forget plot, forget canon, forget themselves. Sadly underwhelming and a poor exploration of one of the best captains.With a great supporting cast but boring, sad and underwhelming arcs for all concerned.","rating":"6\/10","date":"15 April 2022"}
{"title":"RIP - Star Trek","review":"Here's where I depart. I'm going to jump to the novels and start reading those. The current iteration of Star trek has no positivity and does not represent a future I'd have any interest of living in. It's dark and bleak it does not represent the best that humanity has to offer. When I was a kid I dreamed of being on a starship like the Enterprise because it was a place I wanted to be. Here were characters navigating difficult situations and showing the best that humanity had to offer. in addition the original Star trek actually had science fiction concepts behind most of the plot. There is none of that in these new series and in fact I would argue that they're on the level of Star wars level science fiction and that some magical widget is going to save the day. Hopefully one day they come back to making Star trek what it was, but if not I'm good with it we've had years of really good stories as well as novels.","rating":"3\/10","date":"30 March 2020"}
{"title":"Season 3 brings it home","review":"I watched this show when I was 12 through 16. In the years that passed Hollywood and the world of TV went crazy, making things, remaking things, occasionally nailing it and also turning out a whole bunch of 6 out of 10 netflix just make it quick kind of things.Now I'm 45 and I'm really not sure how many more of my childhood memories are left untainted by the desire of people who don't care about them to make more money out of them. So many poorly written sequels, remakes, premakes... But not this one.Season one and two were ok, but season three is really where it works. Huge consideration paid to the source material, it felt like meeting an old friend I haven't seen in years and it all still works. You could see in the eyes and actions of the cast how much it all meant to be back together again. A tour de force of great moments held together by a truly solid storyline and ended well.And so what comes next! If @amazon or @paramount don't make a Riker and Worf spin-off they're nuts. Oh the quality of the banter between these two just works. Seven of Nine starting a new journey just works too...

I felt deep nostalgia and remembered what made me feel like a Trekkie all those years ago. It was a satisfying storyline with my favorite people. The plot line in Season 3 delivered what Picard the series promised, intrigue, suspense, and great acting fused with history. The writing was tremendous and the director did a fantastic job. Awesome. I do wish we could have a season 4 with everyone together, because I'm having withdrawal. Maybe a next generation movie?

{"title":"SEASON 3 SEASON 3 SEASON 3","review":"Season 1: 7 - Season 2: 6 - Season 3: 10+I can't adequately explain how absolutely incredible the third, and sadly last, season of Picard is.Imagine all the hype and hope you had before you heard any of your favorite shows or movies were being rebooted, and let yourself dare to hope it could be that good.Not just as a nerd's fantasy. It truly stands out as some of the best work of film produced in decades. The actors, the story, the production, everything was stellar.The first two seasons stick out like sore thumbs in comparison-but if you are committed to a full watch through, I'd go through them first. Last thing you need is to have the flavor of the last season build up your hopes before unceremoniously dashing them with mediocrity. But if those were the price to pay to finally get it right, so be it.There has never been a sweeter swan song writ for a cast of characters. I don't want to ruin a moment of it, so no spoilers. I only wish I could go back and watch it all for the first time all over again.Thank you.

{"title":"Skip the first 2 seasons and boldly go to the 3rd","review":"This is such a tough series to rate. The first 2 seasons were just a mess (worth 4 stars at best), characterized by lousy characters-almost always either crying or shouting at each other- and terrible writing.The third season made a clear cut and returned to form (and to the old cast). Even the writers seemed to not want anything to do with season 1 and 2, as events that happened in those seasons are barely mentioned and sometimes feel completely inconsequential. The 3rd season is so good, start to finish, even 1 of the most annoying characters (Raffi) partially redeems herself (key word: partially). It's truly one of the best seasons of Trek ever. The writing, the acting, the humor, the nostalgia, the suspense, and tying so many loose ends from previous series together. The old crew got a perfect last hurrah.For me it was such a pleasant surprise that after years of the mediocrity and sometimes utter crap we've been served by this franchise, we got 2 very good seasons one after the other in Picard's season 3 and the debut season of Strange New Worlds. I'd be more hopeful for the future, if it hadn't stung me so many times already in the past.","rating":"7\/10","date":"12 September 2023"}

I know that it has not aged exactly well, but I don't care. I have the entire series.I just cannot believe how time just flies by. Watching this show and saying goodbye to Picard and Patrick Stewart who plays Picard is sad. But I will be forever grateful because this series gave these marvelously created characters a pretty decent send-off. Yes-- it was corny and hokey, but that last scene with them playing cards together like the old days brought a tear to my eye.One peeve:\nI really thought that the character who played Picard's new-found son, Jack, looked more like 30 rather than 20.","rating":"7\/10","date":"26 April 2023"}
{"title":"The worst sci-fi show I've seen in a long time.","review":"Okay. Wow.The writing is atrocious. They write themselves out of every situation that challenges them using technology or physics that more than challenges our suspension of disbelief. Who do they think the audience is? A bunch of morons?Involuntary transport beams, a gigantic Borg cube falling down on a planet that only damages it a little bit and doesn't cause a crater or affects the planet in a big way, a device that does what you imagine, and somehow can be scaled to fake hundreds of ships - all within a matter of seconds of brainstorming? A single neuron needed to clone a synthetic. Tentancle monsters from hell in a wormhole created by a self-forming tower shooting a beam, flowers in space.Writers should embrace constraint! Restrictions! Create a believable world. If anything is possible, and the rules get bent and broken to solve the situation at hand, it gets boring quickly!And seriously: Elnor? Elrond from LOTR you mean.Hastily rehashed sci-fi themes. What a mess!This show doesn't care the slightest bit about its legacy and the values of the brand. There is no vision behind it. Picard can't help selling this. After so many failed Star Trek attempts the last decade, maybe it's time to sunset the franchise and find something original.","rating":"1\/10","date":"13 May 2020"}

Season 3 so far is amazing . It reminds me a lot of the old Star Trek movies especially Wrath of Kahn. They finally made a show that represents the old Ttek and it's fans. Plus it has good special effects and i love how they bring back most of the old characters from the past, The story line is great . I hope they end it great since only on episode 4 sad o far.

{"title":"Earth trip","review":"What I like in Mandalorian is that is titled Mandalorian, neat and simple.It includes a lot of references to the saga, but it is not called Star Wars : Baby Yoda.What I don't like in Star Trek : Picard is that it follows the fashion of making extensions ( sequels,prequels otherquels) dozens years after the originals using nostalgia to support otherwise a mediocre screenplays.But if you want to see if some Star Trek actors aging well you may want to watch the season one, however the second season is clearly an abuse.First, Star Trek is about travel in space and 'boldly' does not refer to the haircut of Partick Steward.Second, Star Trek characters have plenty of symbolic meaning , Data resembles the pursuit to define something that cannot be defined,\nSeven of Eleven is the process of understanding what a human person means.Third, the crew members from each continent represents the human race that has advanced,\nwhich you can hear in almost each episode when the captain patronises lesser species in the stylewe had similar issues in the past, wars, crime, money, greed but we have evolved-.I suppose the Star Trek movie should base on some of the above elements.Instead we are served with a poor written one episode story artificially spread into ten parts, which is basically about two old pensioners who are looking for something,\nand maybe they are in state of a conflict of some sort , but it seems they forgotten what they are really fighting about.I keep the middle score as for visual effects.","rating":"6\/10","date":"17 May 2022"}

{"title":"Star Trek in name only","review":"I was really hoping it would be different. The first scene with the Enterprise D and the zoom in to Picard and Data on 10 Forward had my hopes up that the series would tie in closely to previous Trek series. It's quite different though. A following scene shows Romulans at Chateau Picard in La Barre, France. The Romulans act almost entirely human in their demeanor. Later on a Romulan Reclamation site(cube) a Romulan named Narek is introduced. His mannerisms are those of a British 20 year old. I think it might have been better to use deepfake algorithms to reimage Data's face instead of heavy makeup on Brent Spiner.The styling of the production is more akin to a modern action movie than traditional Star Trek. And there is no technobabble. This may appeal to a younger audience that doesn't have knowledge of the history of Trek. Just my opinion.","rating":"","date":"23 January 2020"}

The special effects on this series has been superb as you would expect.

The writers should be commended in manufacturing ways to get all the best characters back on screen for a rip roaring last adventure.

{"title":"Another serialized, overly dramatic, hopeless-feeling show that got the \"Star Trek\" label slapped on it.","review":"Growing up, I could always count on Star Trek to take me to a consistent world that filled me with hope for the future. Exploring the galaxy in incredible ships that were the pinnacle of human ingenuity. Wondrous technology. Adventures in the holodeck. Role-model captains and their loyal crew. Meeting intriguing, occasionally hostile, alien races every week.Yes, sometimes there was drama, death and worry, but always, ALWAYS, it ended up teaching us a valuable lesson in a clever way and filling us with hope for humanity.That's Star Trek, or at least that's what I think of when I think of Star Trek.Picard continues the recent tradition of being serialized, slow-moving, overly dramatized crap with poor dialog, set in a hopeless world where everything is dark and going to hell. Everything is negative. Lens flares and over-the-top action scenes galore.After seeing the first episode, I realized that not much actually happened in it. That whole section of the story could have been told in about 20 minutes. They are drawing everything out with extra drama, pointless scenes and weak dialog, because adding fluff is the only way they can extend their plot across 10 or however many episodes it is they have planned.I don't want a 10 hour drama film with the slowest possible pacing. I just want Star Trek back. Give us a classic TOS\/TNG\/Voy\/Ent style show again, in an episodic format with an occasional epic two-parter. THAT'S ALL WE WANT!! The formula is a proven winner.Until they return to the roots of what makes Star Trek what it is, I'm done with the franchise. Had some hope for this show. I thought certainly they learned their lesson with the backlash to Discovery? Nope. They didn't.The only good things I can say about this is that the acting is good, and it's not as bad as Discovery.Alex Kurtzman should never be allowed anywhere near this franchise again.","rating":"3\/10","date":"31 January 2020"}
{"title":"They brought the band back together - and it worked!","review":"I resisted watching this for a long time. The first season had been a disappointment and the second just terrible, with poor plots and the new woke characters just didn't work and were intensely annoying. But eventually I gave up and gave it a try. Hey, I watched three seasons of the appalling Star Trek Discovery. (Season two gave me a sliver of false hope.) Well, maybe I'm talking from the viewpoint of having low expectations exceeded, but the moment Worf turned up in the third episode, my hopes rose. Gradually the whole team was reassembled, even Data, who was killed off back at the start of the Picard series. What we ended up with was an excellent Next Generation series. Sure, there are plot holes and crazy leaps and the surprise (though, I suppose, inevitable) revelation as to who the enemy is, but it was just a fun ride for anyone who loved the original Next Generation series. If you aren't hooked after the first couple of episodes, stick with it. I wasn't, and it was a week or two before trying episode three, but then binge watched the rest.","rating":"9\/10","date":"7 July 2023"}
{"title":"It is OK","review":"Reading all the reviews here, being a TNG fan I am, I must agree this is not a classic Star Trek. However, I am not outraged by that. Yes, there are no stand alone episodes, no space exploration, no long dialogues and it is set in a much darker universe with much more intrigue. But that is OK.Look at what you have nowadays in TV, on streaming services or in cinema (prior to covid). A classical Star Trek would not fly. The taste of the masses have shifted to this direction. We view the future much more grimly. Fear mongering (which is the big part of S1) is with is every day. The show have to make financial sense.I think this show is an OK balance. It satisfies the modern taste and gives nice nods to the old ST. I loved how they brought back old characters and referenced old episodes. Picard still stands behind the values, he did before and pulls a move at the end, I would expect from him, based on TNG.Yes, there are weaker episodes and characters but this is S1. It can develop. I also found Rafi and Agnes strange but it was OK.All in all it is an OK, modern Star Trek. Not a masterpiece, but much better then the new Star Trek movies.","rating":"7\/10","date":"28 December 2020"}

{"title":"Just watch Season 3.","review":"By far the Greatest Captain in Star Trek, Picard deserved a dedicated show. The first season of this show was very good. An interesting storyline, good character development and refreshing new with familiar characters. The Second season was a complete disappointment. Frankly, you can and should avoid watching season 2 entirely. It seems like the writers thought so too because Season 3 certainly doesn't follow S2 but rather follows S1 nicely. In fact, if you just watch Season 3 on its own, it is still a brilliant show. Think of it as ST:TNG Season 8. Well written, albeit with a few obvious plot holes, and completely satisfying.Star Trek has been lost for over two decades since the ending of Voyager. Enterprise was only good in S3 & 4. Discovery for S1 and even then only barely watchable. Ironically, the best Trek hasn't been Trek at all - The Orville by Seth MacFarlane.ST:SNW is a breath of fresh air and now that TNG has been laid to a fitting rest, let's hope that Alex and Akiva can steer this beautiful universe back to its roots and give us new stories to take us beyond the Final Frontier.","rating":"9\/10","date":"28 May 2023"}

{"title":"Season 3 is EVERYTHING!!!","review":"Seriously, I want to give this 9.5 for season 3 ALONE! But I don't want to mislead, because I have to account for the first two seasons.Listen, it was a good series. But first season was like 5.5-6 stars. It was REALLY hard for me to get through it, tho it wasn't terrible. It just lagged and failed to really reel me in. So I watched in short installments. It was kind of what I watched in between other binges. I had some issues with casting. The male antagonist and female protagonist especially. Which as you can imagine could make watching a tad difficult. Still it wasn't a complete loss. I was for all basic purposes, entertained. Keep reading!Season 2 was a marked improvement, it was binge-worthy, but still had the propensity to drag on. So much so, it felt like they didn't have enough written for a series. It was the season of aimless subplots. The subplot involving Picard's childhood was agonizingly drawn out and overly dramatic. And the subplot had little if anything really to do with the major plot line.I feel like they pulled the relationship between Seven and Rafaela out of a hat. They didn't build up to it well so it just felt like it came out of nowhere. Especially when most of Raf's backstory\/love life was steeped in estrangement from her family (ex-husband and son\/son's wife and child). They spent the whole 2nd season with Raf lamenting over her lack of connection with Seven, with little recognition from Seven's character at all. So there's also little reward, when that subplot reaches its conclusion.It was honestly a little difficult to swallow just how poorly the team managed their expedition. They just failed at like every turn and failed to really do anything well. That said, it was an exciting ride and the setup in the first episode was definitely satisfied in the final episode. 6-7 stars. (But keep reading tho!!)And then there was Season 3!!!I don't know what changes they made to bring in this magic, but they made all the right changes, all the right moves.They seemed to kind of ignore a lot of what happened in season 2 and left nearly all of season 1 firmly in the past. A part of me wants to count it against them for continuity's sake but as I stated before, much of what was ignored was inconsequential to the story anyway! So we press on into a brilliantly crafted final season, chalk full of the reunion we deserved, new characters that are Halloween\/Cosplay worthy, and a storyline that had me on the edge of my seat pretty much the whole season. THIS was a fast binge! It had all the heart, all the thrills that measured up to Discovery and Strange New World. It was so good, I have the desire to watch it again. I just have to let it sit for a bit and let all the feelings run their course. Because of how untethered the season is to the previous seasons I can watch the 3rd season again all on its own.I don't expect I'll ever watch season 1 again, maybe season 2 with some fast-forwarding involved?But for new watchers, I nerdly recommend watching the full series because there are indeed some significant events and character development you need to fully appreciate season 3. You'll otherwise be confused in some places. Like I said first two seasons weren't a wash, just not strong, just not what they should have\/could have been. That said...if you're less forgiving than me and you just can't take it...I honestly think you can get away with watching season 3 on its own and you can still appreciate its greatness. Just might not hit as hard.Season 3 alone makes this show worth the watch.My only qualm is that they didn't start off like this!","rating":"8\/10","date":"14 August 2023"}

You don't need to watch season 2 to understand season 3 but I would suggest watching season 1 before season 3. Season 3 feels like TNG and proper trek unlike the first 2 seasons.

{"title":"Stunning Season 3","review":"I am beyond thrilled and excited by S3 of Picard. I have found it both intriguing and a memory lane stroll to see so many friends and familiar faces.The acting was superb from the entire cast, but, I must single out Todd Stashwick (I need this character!) portraying Captain Shaw, Titan's Captain. He was masterful, showing the kind of light and dark that you never expected when you first meet him.Michelle Hurd is stunning, and her interactions with Michael Dorn brought a smile more often than not - the contrast was perfect. The entire ensemble was brilliant as I remembered them from the second in the stable. Now if we could just get Captain Jonathon Archer into the show I would be gleefully clapping.I could individually list what each actor did to make the ensemble work so coherently, and with an urgency I've missed.It was Star T version of TNG assembled, both fun and dramatic to see how they all interacted so seamlessly. The humour always a thrill, when inserted so expertly at the right places.Everyone in my view, outstanding. The plot was a fabulous and Amanda Plummer supreme, she is just so able to inhabit her characters, it was delicious!There was a rightful nod to TNG canon with a few twists and turns. The inclusion of a son for Picard in the form of the gifted English actor Ed Speleers, as Jack Crusher (Huge spoiler there!) was well done. The angsty, often flippant and dismissive Jack, illustrating a longing for understanding that it takes his father a good while to understand and appreciate. Patrick Stewart needs no fanfare, his intensity and cool demeanor struggling to deal with this new twist so late in life. It was also nice to get some background to off screen life that sadly we had not been privy to since TNG was cancelled. For me, this season is a triumph of amazing story telling and superb casting, crew et el! For 10\/10.","rating":"10\/10","date":"29 April 2023"}
{"title":"Not bad, but I had expected more\/better","review":"As \"Star Trek - Picard\" (2020 release; 10 episodes of about 48 min each) opens with Episode 1 \"Remembrances\", Picard is playing poker with Data, only to awaken abruptly on his estate \"Chateau Picard\" in France. It was just a dream. We then go to \"Greater Boston\", as we are introduced to a couple, enjoying the evening. Out of nowhere, baddies appear and ambush the couple, killing the guy... At this point we are 10 min into Episode 1.Couple of comments: this is the highly anticipated return of Patrick Stewart in his iconic role of Star Trek's Jean-Luc Picard. Picard has retired from Star Fleet, enjoying the rustic life on the vineyard of Chateau Picard. Yet beneath that outer calm is a restlessness we will soon discover. And what about the woman whose boyfriend was ambushed? Where does she fit into all this? We will soon find out as well. If, like me, you are expecting a \"Next Generation\"-like return, I'm afraid you are in for a disappointment. Indeed, this mini-series is very different, both in style and in approach. For one, the 10 episodes cannot be watched as stand-alone episodes (where in the \"Next Generation\" certain story lines evolve over episodes, the episodes nevertheless can be viewed on their own). As a result, the story lines in \"Star Trek - {Picard\" move slowly, very slowly. Director Hanelle Culpepper, who was involved with \"Star Trek - Discovery\" returns to direct the initial 3 episodes. The visuals are spectacular and it's always a joy to watch Patrick Stewart's acting chops (he also executive-produced). But in the end, while this certainly not a \"bad\" mini-series, I simply had expected more\/better.I missed it when \"Star Trek - Picard\" was initially released in early 2020. But with Season 2 scheduled to premier next month (February 17, 2022). I decided now was a good time to catch up on it, and I've been binge-watching it on Paramount+.

I watched the 1st season of Picard and they hinted, last episode, at the \"twists\" coming in the next season. Part way into the 3d episode of Season 2 out it came. Seven of Nine now likes girls. Star Trek canon: she was married to Chakotay? Forget it. Hollywood has to drag everything through it's own distorted reality and once again they've shown it. Skip this one. I canceled.","rating":"1\/10","date":"17 March 2022"}
{"title":"Doesnt feel like Star Trek...","review":"Just finished the first season. Barely. The last episode stretches on like abubble gum. And they try to make it deep and meaningful but failing miserably.\nIt feels onedimensional, characters are not developed and while they might have potential, it is not realized. The story is stupid and it is pathetic that ONE (1) single episode of TNG or VOYAGER had more of a story, good action, wisdom, moral quandries, character evolution and intrigue than the WHOLE season of Picard.\nThis is 100% generic tv show format on all fronts. Feels like a typical show planned to hit as many of the boxes for as wide a variety of viewership as possible. Sacrificing quality and depth,instead its all catered and narrated and over simplified.\nEven Bakulas Enterprise was better.","rating":"","date":"30 January 2020"}

{"title":"A miraculous comeback","review":"The first season was OK-ish, some Romulans, some Borg ... watchable 6.The second season was just painfully bad. A reminder that there are still executives who firmly believe that viewers are total idiots to whom they can sell absolutely anything.The story, characterization, motivation, exposition, instant moralization ... on the level of a Turkish soap operas, only worse. And decorated with idiocies like \"We've regained 26% of navigational capabilities\" What on earth does that even mean?A hard earned 0.And finally, season 3.After the first two episodes all I can say is ... WOW.A miraculous comeback. Sure, there's some less than ideal drama scaffolding, some scripting heavy handedness here and there, but overall... more than solid TV entertainment, even if viewed entirely outside the scope of the Star Trek universe.It's too early to give a final rating after just two episodes, but for now 8.Shaky, but 8 never the less.","rating":"8\/10","date":"24 February 2023"}

{"title":"Season 1 is better than the Discovery train wreck, but ultimately disappointing","review":"As a die hard Star Trek fan I was optimistic about Star Trek: Picard, because I'd heard it was significantly better than Star Trek: Discovery. Overall, I was disappointed. It was nice to see Picard and the gang again. But this is a poor reflection of what Star Trek is and what I love about Star Trek.The people behind the CBS Star Treks and the movie reboots don't understand what made Star Trek what it is (what it was, anyway).Star Trek was about exploring, about respect and camaraderie in the crew, about how science and reason can overcome the baser aspects of human nature, about people who have moved beyond seeking money, power, sex, etc. And are pursuing higher goals of personal growth. Ultimately, it was about optimism for the future.Star Trek: Picard tries to do some of these things, but doesn't really succeed. It's like a recipe that has been lost, and attempts to recreate it never work.The problem with making Star Trek mainly about action - besides the loss of all those good aspects I listed above - is that it becomes merely another action franchise. That's a losing battle. There are already lots of action franchises, and Star Trek now has little reason to exist. Also, with action you have to keep upping the ante - more explosions, badder villains, etc. Because people get bored with seeing the same stuff that's already been done. There is no storytelling substance, and superficiality is not satisfying in the long term. You can't live on candy alone.The plot of the first season of Picard has things that don't make sense or are just dumb. It seems to get worse toward the end of the season. The relationships never really gel either.It didn't help that the show is TV-MA, littered with F-bombs, etc. Star Trek was never about that stuff, and it's not enjoyable to me.(Added for Season 2) While Discovery is a train wreck, season 2 of Picard is at least a grand vision poorly realized. They need to re-edit season 2 down to about 6 episodes.Some things were dumb, some things I hated, but with much fast forwarding it was worthwhile watching for a long-time fan like me.The best part was the 3 minute segment about the Traveler in the last episode. I want to see a lot more about this. Maybe a spinoff? Please?","rating":"7\/10","date":"4 September 2020"}
{"title":"Good But Not Perfect","review":"Having just finished the first episode I can say that I enjoyed it. There were no wtf? Moments as occurred with the first episode of Discovery. It was great to see Patrick Stewart return to the role of Jean Luc Picard. The first show basically introduces the characters and sets the scene for what will effectively be a 10 hour movie. There is nothing especially revelatory going on, other than explaining Picard is not the man he was due to a series of tragic events starting with the loss of his good friend Data. I notice some saying this isn't the same Picard we were used to seeing on TNG. Well obviously not, 20 years have passed and life has taken its toll on the character. That's actual reality! What did these people want a rehash of their favourite TNG episodes? Well I can categorically state most of us Trekkies absolutely did not want that. There's also absolutely no politics in this first episode, other than a reference that Picard makes to the Federation failing. How it's failed I'm sure will transpire in future episodes. So you can take all the reviews here about it being anti Trump and Brexit at this stage as complete made up nonsense. Just as Discovery I'm looking forward to seeing how this show plays out.Continuation 16\/2\/2020 - I've just come back to check what other people are saying about the show and there's loads of negative reviews. I checked about 50 of these negative ones and surprise surprise about 50% of them have only ever made one review. Again IMDB needs to recognise there's a disparity in a show being rated 8.4 and loads of \"dodgy\" negative reviews.","rating":"8\/10","date":"23 January 2020"}

A waste of great, loved actors & characters..Poor CGI. To many plot issues to mention. Time travel to save universe trope. The doctor from ds9 is now Picards dad?! Nobody can die. Borg are cuddly. Obligatory secret lesbian. Gods are lonely (& die). Enemies can't aim & never need to reload. Contrived self indulgent plot twists.

{"title":"I Have Watched Star Trek for 54 Years... Why Does This Exist?","review":"54 years, I know, it's a long time, the world has changed, some for the better and some not so much so, but that's how time weaves the future, balance is King.Even as a child, I understood Star Trek was something different. Something that taught me life lessons I was probably too young to learn, but I learned them anyway.When I was 7 years old I watched an original episode of Star Trek called \"Let That Be Your Last BattleField\" co-starring the late great Frank Gorshin. The story in a nutshell were two people fighting, who looked similar, half their face was black the other side white (an obvious allegory for an Adult, but I was oblivious) the \"twist\" of the episode was \"Kirk\" claiming why were they fighting, they were the same species, Gorshin's character said something like are you blind, I am black on the RIGHT side and his opponent was black on the LEFT side. Though this whole episode, I hadn't even noticed, at that point the LIGHT went on. The stupidity of judging someone by the way they look.Star Trek was about the future, it was about how far we had come. We had grown up as a species, we had moved past the horror's of our history. We FINALLY learned to work together to benefit everyone.PICARD is not Star Trek, I would say it's the opposite. It seems to be everything wrong with the world TODAY... New's Flash, I can see that on the nightly news, I DO NOT need it on my TV Shows. If you just want a space adventure show that's kind of boring, then by all means, go for it, but if you are looking for Star Trek.. you will not find it here.","rating":"5\/10","date":"2 January 2023"}

{"title":"So disappointed...","review":"...in reading the low reviews. People are expecting the same formula that has worked with TOS, TNG, DS9, Enterprise, Voyager etc. Interviews months before indicated less action and more character driven. The less expectations you come into it, you'll realize this is a damn good show. Seriously, after 20 years, you want to see the characters we love rehash the same thing we've seen over 6 different shows. This show delivers with the character development of Picard and other past ST characters and how they evolved. One thing that hasn't changed, they have incorporaed themes that are relevant today.

Yes I'm a fan of the previous star Trek series this has very little to do with what the shows aboutData's daughter...that story has been done why rehash it?Oh another if data's family literally noone knew about.Oh suddenly TV is a thing in the future...where it's barely mentioned or seen in such a way through virtually the entire franchise.The CGI. The scene where riker comes with some of the fleet is borderline lazy, yeah ok a lot of sovereign class..the futures here and Starfleet though yeah let's build the sovereign class only. It's lazy and anyway yeah sure a huge percentage of the fleet are near or sat near a station somewhere and can all get there that quick. Jog off.Highly unlikely Starfleet would use \"synthetics\" to that degree on that scale.They are all good actors...the writing however is written by a group who obviously need to revisit the endless hours of what's already been made and try againSeason 2 is inbound...back in time again to the present day...wonder where that's been done before.Get better writers and use the backstory you have and the great actors are write some sort of story that is new.","rating":"6\/10","date":"9 November 2021"}

It should be marketed as a star trek inspired sci fi program because that's all it is. The writing, dialogue and acting are terrible. The set designs look good but you can barely see them cos nobody knows where the light switch is. The camera bounces around all over the place. Every surprise that happens is followed by an expletive, which adds nothing to the show.The future looks depressing and everyone seems angsty, emotional and drug dependent.

{"title":"Reject Seasons 1 and 2, buy Season 3","review":"This is one of the hardest to review series I have ever seen. Having watched all three seasons, the first two seasons are abominations that basically need to be disregarded as picard having fever dreams. With the third season being the first season of Star Trek that is actually well written in decades.I highly recommend purchasing Picard Season 3, and NEVER ever ever watching seasons 1 or 2 unless you are extremely drunk. Treat Picard season 1 and 2 merely as \"omake\" or a fever dream in the manner that the film: Star Trek 5 should be treated as a Bean and Whiskey fueld dream by James T. Kirk (while the trio were out camping, and consuming whiskey and beans.Season 3 is well written with a phenominal understanding of both the Next Generation series AND the movies. The nostalgia bait IS nostagalia bait, but it's actually organic to the story and incredibly well written. Hopefully if they make anything more i9nvolving Star Trek will be like season 3, and NOT like the first two seasons.","rating":"","date":"2 May 2023"}
{"title":"This isn't Star Trek? Think, People!","review":"Honestly, I can't believe the hatred this series is amassing and the feeble reasoning for doing so.\nSo the federation isn't the embodyment of perfection that you thought it was?\nA (tiny) bit of swearing really kills the spirit of Gene Roddenberry?\nFor 30 years, the means of serial storytelling have moved away from a villain\/crisis-of-the-week scenario to an overarching plot, which is so much more sophisticated than having the same interchangeable episodes that are only connected by the weakest of thread, and yet people are shouting bloody murder if they can't get their ephemeral bit of redemption at the end of every day?\nOr was the sexuality of Seven of Nine really that ironclad that there could at least be an excuse for the bigots to whine about a breach of canon?Please, people, grow up!This series is very much in the spirit of Star Trek. It's about exploration, rectification of wrongs and personal growth.\nThe cast is up to the task at any given time, especially Santiago Cabrera, who doesn't play one, but six characters each with a different accent and attitude, Patrick Stewart, who reprises as Picard who is still (and for everyone to see) a figure of integrity, reason and ethics, and Isa Briones as daughter of Data whose acting depicts brilliantly the breaking apart and regaining control after a live changing event.\nThe effects and scene design are nothing short of outstanding, beautiful albeit grittier than most of the franchise before.\nThe plot needs a bit of time to get rolling but then does it with verve and suspense.What's really perplexing is the analogy some people are drawing between ST:P and Star Trek: Discovery. These series are nothing alike! While the latter could be subsumed as \"the Michael Burnham Show\", where every other character is little more than staffage for her personal and, at times, irrational attics, ST:P has a large variety of characters, each with a believeble and well thought trough backstory. hold together by a lynchpin that is Picard.Qui habet aures audiendi audiat!\nThere is nothing wrong with this series, nor isn't it in the best spirit of Star Trek. But people who loved their Kirk, their TNG and DS9, but cannot see that 25, 30 or 50 years have past since, will just hate this series for no other reason then that it isn't what it was, while they still are.

I thought they were going to show the lifting up of darker times, and bring back hope into the star trek universe like the rest of the series. Boy am I wrong so far. Betrayal, murder, revenge seem to be the modus operandi so far. While we are at it lets just kill off a couple of characters from next gen and voyager. What the hell Kurtzman.

{"title":"True to Star Trek","review":"I had read some reviews of this series and consequently, I was worried about the quality of this series, and I am speaking only about Season One. Over the years, I have found that some of the series of Star Trek (not all of them at the same level) have been a good source of inspiration or reflexion concerning our civilisation or world, its evolution and its level of ethics. I was a bit doubtious while considering the commentaries that were not always positive. I should say that when I got past the fifth episode, I had to go through the end of the season through the night I got to this point... Why? I understood afterwords that if Patrick Stewart agreed to this series and its participation in it, it was worthwile in some fashion... The people involved in this series, as Jonathan Frakes, are, I think, true believers of the star trek values, and it shows... Of course, some of the decisions taken concerning survival issues seem to be based upon the fact that Star Trek TNG actors are aging (every sentient being wants to survive... why wouldn't Data?). Nevertheless, overall, this series is quite true to the values put forwards by the Star Trek franchise. It reminds me of the movie \"Lawrence of Arabia\" and the words said by Peter O'tool: \"Nothing is written\", after saving a young arabian devoted to Lawrence from the desert, in opposition with every other arabians who considered his expected death as fate (as Omar Sharif as Sherif Ali), which is what Picard is putting forward... \"History is repeating itself\" is not a fact if our future actions are evaluated analytically and with full \"humanity\". The future is not determined and depends upon our actions. One individual can sometimes substancially change the course of a civilisation.","rating":"9\/10","date":"19 January 2021"}

It's now got a show for all the fascist left who cares only for their own opinions that have been fashioned in the darkest basements of their respective parents.Having said that, if you can just acknowledge that this is what comes out of Hollywood now, it's quite watchable.

{"title":"Not A Cringe Fanboy Review","review":"OK, if you've found yourself looking at the reviews for the final season of Picard, then you're either a cringe fanboy looking for confirmation bias that it's terrible and crap and waaah, or you're a genuinely curious audience member without any biases looking for reflections on the show before\/after viewing.This review is by someone in the latter category.So if you're tired of seeing one and two star reviews from entitled, sweaty man-babies, congrats: you've found one that's from an actually (somewhat) normal audience member.REVIEW: it's actually pretty enjoyable.There's plenty of warm and fuzzy's I got seeing these characters which I have shared moments with throughout my life as older gentleman embarking on a new adventure.It's definitively influenced by the new wave of Star Trek started by JJ Abrams and Chris Pine (which I've never had a problem with, in fact, I think it makes for more exciting television\/film). Anamorphic lenses and all.I know that the old Star Trek formula is almost completely devoid of any panache or pizzazz and is solely focused on thought exercises and moral quandaries, and there is certainly a place for that in history, but new wave Star Trek seems to be focusing more on personal conflicts, and personal drama, rather than academics, which to me is perfectly serviceable.TECHNICAL:\nThe look of the show is incredibly Moody, which, for me as a filmmaker is positively sumptuous, and is far superior to the flatly lit, overly saturated cardboard colors of yesteryear. The lens choice is lovely, the color grade is truly satisfying, and the editing is smooth. Also the music is really well done! Not always a given for TV.The performances are somewhat stiff, but in an endearing way, clearly indicative of hokey-but-genuine early 90s television which has a nostalgic power for me personally. The characters seem to be themselves, which (again) is not always a given with legacy sequels. The adventure itself is for the time being somewhat simple, but there is a mystery box mechanism at play, which I am genuinely intrigued to see pan out.I would personally recommend this show to anyone who's generally compelled by science fiction\/space\/adventure material.If you've made it this far, congratulations.Ummm... engage.","rating":"7\/10","date":"22 February 2023"}
{"title":"Truly embarrassing","review":"I've never written an IMDB review before but I feel compelled to after seeing all the 10\/10 reviews here that are clearly bought by Paramount or made by some of the dullest people on earth. This show is awful. The writing is atrocious. There's no vision or focus. The ideals and principles that made Star Trek unique are all but gone. The hope, the optimism, the exploration... you won't find any of that here. Instead you'll find pessimism, extreme violence, hate... it's trying to be modern. I get it. But this missed the mark, big time in my eyes. It could have been modern without ruining the underlying vibe of Star Trek. Maybe this has something to do with the 12+ executive producers, way too many cooks in the kitchen, or maybe something else. I don't know but this isn't Star Trek. Instead it's an embarrassing, soulless cash grab.","rating":"2\/10","date":"29 January 2023"}
{"title":"Slow start and minor issues, but fantastic plot so far.","review":"I feel terrible for Patrick Stewart seeing all of these terrible reviews based on the first few episodes. The next few episodes after this weeks third will start to get more interesting an entertaining. The plot so far is extremely interesting because of the many ways it can go, especially the building redemption arc for the events on mars; understanding the story behind the sisters and their \"mythology\"; and figuring out how the sisters relate to Data. So many references to previous series to maintain cannon, and people still complain. Let the plot develop before leaving such a harsh opinion.Finally, cons for the series so far. I'm not a huge fan of some of the awkward editing between scenes. The transitions just seem so abrupt and unexpected. I'm also not impressed at how slowly canonical characters are being introduced. I thought I would have at least seen Seven of Nine by now.","rating":"8\/10","date":"7 February 2020"}

{"title":"A world incapable of writing positive stories?","review":"There seems to be a total inability at the moment for writers to create intelligent, consistent and positive stories on television. Everything has to be based on disaster, conflict, discriminations and personal point-scoring agendas. That added with a contemporary obsession for using tokenism (through ridiculously over-powered characterisation and reverse stereotyping), realism-breaking CGI and a gratuitous use of cynicism. Perhaps this is one reason why watching old episodes of Star Trek: The Next a Generation still brings so much joy and hope to people? A positive, realistic and intricately-created future world that actually we'd all like to live in and humanity could aspire to.So, after scrapping years of terrible 'style-over-substance' reboots and non-intelligent efforts which use the franchise in name only, we now receive Star Trek: Picard. At last (I hear fans shout), a show that moves on the original timeline on and expands upon the ideals of Gene Roddenberry's utopian (if not, then hopeful) universe?Sadly, not it seems. For this new reincarnation seems to fall into the pitfalls that many current television creations seem to find themselves in. There's little in it's USP to make it standout from the dystopian fantasy genre the producers have decided to place it in. It's truly hard and, if totally honest, painful to watch something you grew up caring so much about being desecrated in such a crude and moronic manner. This new world is dark, bleak and lacks any feel for what Star Trek should be about. It doesn't feel canon. It's melodramatic. It's totally unrealistic, straying away from its exploration and evolutionary values of humanity. The musical soundtrack is so over the top and constant, that it makes 80s action film scores seem underplayed.But most of all, where has the intelligence gone from this world? Why has technology gone backwards? Why has the Federation, that spawned so many good people built on solid moral principles, regressed to a selfishly immoral antagonist? Why do all the alien races now look the same? Why would a universe ban \"synthetic life\" after a disaster and not work together to find out what went wrong and learn from it? I seriously could write a more plausible storyline from my lounge.I'm sorry Gene, but it seems Hollywood has let you down once again.","rating":"3\/10","date":"25 January 2020"}

{"title":"What Star trek should be","review":"I grew up on startrek (tng, ds9) and can't underestimate the effect they had on my life. They were the only role models that I can think of that made it okay, even cool, to be a science geek. I didn't get that feeling from many of the treks that followed. They weren't bad per say. They just missed the point.lPicard is a return to form. The aspiration, the enthusiasm and egarness to see what's out there. The highlights for me are the nods to tng, but the creators have not fallen into the trap of making a it a nostalga fest. I'lm my opinion, they've got the balance of past, but potential for the future with some interesting new characters, spot on.Personally my favorite new characters are the romulans that live with Picard. Thier story isn't told, but you can feel the history there without a word being told (all credit to the actors, esp the Irish lady). I hope they'll be a regular feature.The show is a must watch for people who feel that both Star trek and the world has lost its way.","rating":"10\/10","date":"1 February 2020"}

{"title":"Great foundation of a Star Trek story so far.","review":"Similar to when I first watched TNG, I approached Picard with little expectation. Almost immediately I was drawn into the story, and wished that the entire series was available to binge watch.This is Star Trek for those who want more meat on the bones of their storylines. I'm sure some humour will be introduced when needed, but right now it needs to be as dramatic as it is. This helps in character development, plus fills the void of information between the last time we saw Picard and the present.The acting has been solid so far, and whilst it may take a little while before I start truly caring for new characters, after two episodes I find myself fully invested.I don't understand why so many have rated this series so poorly, and can only assume that their expectations were more based on the action packed J.J. Abrams visualisation of the franchise. Perhaps they forget how many of the Picard focused TNG episodes were more cerebral and emotional than others.I strongly recommend you give this new series a chance as I feel it will become a classic.","rating":"9\/10","date":"4 February 2020"}
{"title":"Star Trek: 2 Fast 2 Furious","review":"I'm not averse to violent action sequences, but Star Trek: Picard should not have relied so much on them. CBS stole the entire spirit of Star Trek (humanism, moral introspection) and gave us an empty husk with cameos.A few quick thoughts after finishing the last episode:Dr. Jurati straight up murdered someone and got away with it.Riker returns from retirement as a pizza rancher and is given command of the entire fleet. Ok.Picard is now a synth.. but synths have no mechanical features anymore?.. so.. he's not a synth? He downloaded his brain into a new body?Had to see Patrick Stewart lying down in a loincloth. Thanks CBS.When Dr. Jurati used the field replicator to project her face 30 times, I almost threw my phone at the TV.Elnor's tears at Picard's 'death'. Such bad acting I laughed at what should have been a touching moment.Not a single Q cameo. Lost opportunity guys... but perhaps John de Lancie had the foresight not to tarnish his record with this lackluster reboot.Rios and Dr. Jurati end up together. Guess we'll just forget that she murdered the last guy she was with. In other news, looks like she'll inherit a ship soon.","rating":"6\/10","date":"31 March 2020"}
{"title":"What do you expect?","review":"This is good sci fi and it's great to see some of the old star trek characters back. I'm a massive star trek fan and I don't have a problem that the way they are making the show is different to what has come before. TNG wouldn't have been as good if they had made it exactly the same as TOS. Likewise people who think Picard is bad because it isn't the same as TNG are living in the past. This is star trek but it is modern star trek. Viewing culture has changed, ways of filming have changed, single story arc for a season etc. This show has had a slow start but is really ramping up now. I for one am enjoying it.","rating":"10\/10","date":"14 March 2020"}
{"title":"What a wasted oportunity","review":"As usual the clone fans, dismiss this show because it isnt a clone of the classic shows, and only because ot that.\nI like the new more dark uptakes on the universe (I love the classics, but also believe theres room for more), it\u00c2\u00b4s different, more real, it\u00c2\u00b4s a new approach isntead of making a clone show. But... the plot in Picard... is poor. Everything else is good, characters, acting... but the story... the story and the 2 final episodes, are very very poorly written. It\u00c2\u00b4s a shame, it had the potential, but as it is, it the weakest ST show ever.\nMildly entertaining.","rating":"6\/10","date":"6 August 2020"}

Who the hell wrote this stuff? Why didn't the actors stop them? Woof.Everything from the script to the basic story line is utterly awful. The nonsense singing scenes. The cringy dialogue and acting. The forced relationships. Everything. Trash. It's like no one was even trying, just let their four year olds direct this into the ground. I kept watching thinking - hoping - it would get better but somehow it just got worse. I would not recommend this show (or Discovery) to anyone.","rating":"4\/10","date":"2 March 2023"}
{"title":"As a lifelong Trekkie, I think CBS actually got it right this time!","review":"You must understand you cannot have a 90's show in 2020, that's NEVER gonna happen. But what u can have is an amazing 2020 show that carries the essence of old. And I believe CBS finally nailed it with ST: Picard. I'm 38 so I grew up on TNG, Voyager, DS9 & Enterprise & continue to watch reruns to this very day, Ty BBC for keeping the STU alive, but I also appreciate high intensity, great CG, immersive sets & costume design, stellar acting, incredible storyline and the full 9 that is today's TV & film style. So I'm in love with this new marriage of the original essence of the show with today's awesome film making technology. I think CBS kept every generation of fans in mind during the creation of this show, while also attracting a new younger generation of Trekkies to the screen. And I greatly appreciate that the network actually listened to us over the train wreck that was Discovery & really tried to deliver a better & truer 2020 version of the STU that kept much closer to the soul of what Star Trek is. The new show is beautiful & as long as you watch it thru 2020 eyes, you'll fall in love with it too!","rating":"9\/10","date":"28 January 2020"}
{"title":"Wanted and still want to like it.","review":"But I'm having to force myself through episode 7, same as many of the previous episodes.\nIt has lots of bits, snippets that could be something, but overall it is less than the sum of its parts. Most of the characters are alright and it is nice to see the lives of the old characters in this updated verse but its not enough.\nThe themes, of betrayal and betrayal of values, alienation...might have worked...the story might have worked, if introduced with a light touch over the course of each episode. But what we have here is a soap opera. One long narrative hinging on a few details that might get slightly resolved after about another 4 hrs.\nI really want to like it. I guess the story-telling algorithms have spoken and I will probably finish the series out of a sense of misplaced loyalty, (well done algorithms), but might as well admit theres nothing left of Star Trek going forward.","rating":"6\/10","date":"7 March 2020"}
{"title":"not as good as next generation","review":"When Picard made his debut in Star Trek: TNG, it was the best Star Trek Character since the TOS characters. The show would soon become one of the longest running Star Trek shows ever and like its predecessor spawned several movies, including a crossover with TOS as well as a CD-ROM game featuring the Borg. Now years after Stewart voiced in American Dad as well as being in a lot of X-Men movies as well as Logan, he is back in an internet only series set years after the next generation and featuring Seven of Nine played by Jeri Ryan as an older borg. Reaction to this show is mixed among star trek fans young and old, and it has been renewed for season 2.

{"title":"To whom it may concern","review":"Star Trek has been part of my life as long as I can remember. I am by no means a fan. I'm not a \"trekkie\". It's just that as part of my entertainment there always was a Kirk, a Picard, a Sisko, a Janeway and all the other characters who entered the collective lore of sci-fi fans worldwide.It's probably fair to say that this isn't Star Trek as we got to know it. Starfleet isn't an idealistic organization exploring the stars and seeking out new civilizations anymore. It is a part of this Federation steeped in future \"realpolitics\" and they even learned to embrace swearing again adding F-bombs to proton torpedos and phasers. Everything seems dysfunctional and broken.Maybe that was necessary. I always wondered how the major Star Trek characters endured so much without being broken. They toyed a bit with Picard's \"Borg trauma\" but nothing a good game of poker among friends and a little chitchat in 10forward couldn't fix. Star Trek was after all a happy place and a reflection of our desire for a better future.Is \"Star Trek: Picard\" the way? It doesn't feel like it to me mostly because it doesn't appear to be an evolution of a series but rather a radical deconstruction which is also a very sloppy and careless one. The writing team deliberately doesn't turn a new page for Star Trek but rather rips out old pages replacing them with new dogma. I don't like that. I liked old Star Trek but maybe this wasn't made for me and I just haven't figured out for whom they made this new series. I wonder if the writing team knows.Apart from those points it is competent television in terms of special effects and camera work. The show looks modern but not always distinctly like \"Trek\". The dialogue could be better, like, a lot better. The pacing within and between episodes is jerky and feels off. Some content doesn't really help the plot but rather drives agenda (not a lot but because it's so on the nose when it appears it sticks out all the more). Many of the characters are hyper-emotional and the \"bad guys\" in particular are horribly overacted which is something they have in common with the recent \"Star Trek: Discovery\" series which also suffered from the dichotomy of emotionally mushy protagonists and over the top villains.The bottom line is that for someone like me this is at best average entertainment.","rating":"","date":"12 March 2020"}

{"title":"My rating may be temporary...","review":"Because season 3 is shaping up up nicely so far I may have to give it a higher rating later. I've been a Trek fan since TOS as a kid and have greatly enjoyed everything related except Discovery. I've zoomed through this series only recently subscribed to Paramount+. The first season was a little all over the place for me but came together in the end. (Kind of) I enjoyed season 2 much more. I loved the last episode especially. Watched it twice. Now into season 3, episode 2 and this season rocks so far. If I had to rate the show on this season only it would be a 9. Only Babylon 5 would ever get a 10. Oops, better slow this down. As I'm writing I'm rewatching episode 7 before I watch 8. I have only one thing to say...Todd Stashwick better damn well get his own BRAND NEW Star Trek series on Paramount+ along with Jeri Ryan or else...The Best Damn television I've seen in a long time. Now if someone will....please, please bring to the small screen David Weber's Honor Harrington series.","rating":"10\/10","date":"16 March 2023"}
{"title":"Season 3 is a return to form","review":"Like Star Trek: Strange New Worlds, Picard, as of season 3 is bucking the trend of the newer Treks (Discovery and the first two seasons of Picard) that showed a violent, fascist Federation that was filled with bitter and broken people, and has returned to the more optimistic tone of the original Trek series (TOS, TNG, DS9, Voyager and Enterprise)Unlike Discovery, the Starfleet officers act like trained military people, rather than children, and there is no shouting, screaming, or tantrums on the bridge. The characters act like adults. They may not particularly like each other, but they trust each other to be professionals.Is the show perfect? Not by a long shot. Is it outstanding, like so many people are claiming? I'd say no to that, as well.I think a lot of people have been so disappointed with the JJ Abrams Trek movies, Discovery, and the first seasons of Picard that they're overcompensating by praising Strange New Worlds and now Picard far more than they deserve.Picard season 3, like SNW, is definitely a return to the original formula. The characterizations are good, the acting is good, and the stories are intriguing. But the key element is that both shows are filled will likeable characters and an optimistic world (or galaxy)view.After the unlikable characters and nihilistic stories of Discovery and Picard before it, the newer series.are being praised just for being different. That doesn't automatically make them brilliant, though.Is Picard season 3 good? Yes, it's good to very good. And it's certainly worth watching, which I wouldn't say about the previous seasons. But it's not perfect, and don't watch it expecting to be blown away by the series.","rating":"6\/10","date":"27 February 2023"}
{"title":"Way to go (out)!","review":"Started well and got better with each episode and season. Season 3 has me on the edge of my seat and waiting for each new episode. This is everything Star Trek Discovery wasn't. Fantastic technology, different locations, characters you can relate to, and villains that pull you into the story and keep you wanting more. It's been a long time since I've actually looked forward to a new episode of any show and felt the pangs of wanting to see it now and finding it hard to wait for each new one to be released. In this case the writers, creators, directors and actors have done it for me. The only negative thing I can say about this show is I'm sorry to see they're won't be a Season 4 but if a show has to go this is the way to do it. High fives to all involved.","rating":"10\/10","date":"16 April 2023"}

I didn't even mind Enterprise. Don't get me wrong, I like the idea of this new series. Glad to see Patrick Stewart back in the saddle again as Picard. What I don't like is that they've started adding foul language into the series. For instance, \"Jean-Luc, shut the _____ up!\". I mean really....is the language necessary? Does it really improve the quality of the show? Like I always tell my kids....just because you can, doesn't mean you should. I remember when Star Trek was a show of exploration.....to go where no man has gone before. If you want a show to survive, then you need to open it up to where even the young people can enjoy it....after all, they are the ones who are going to be the future. I agree with the reviews previous to mine. Just putting my two cents in. If the show improves, I'll update my review.","rating":"6\/10","date":"14 March 2020"}
{"title":"This really is lazy.","review":"And dragging back Q won't change the fact that this show's creators already proved they can't present an optimistic future AND still present dramatic and challenging plots. This is like a lame soap opera hijacking Star Trek. Maybe introduce something completely unthinkable that gives some sense of hope because this is still a SCIENCE FICTION show.Does everything have to be a reflection of the signs of the times where people today are obsessed with sex, money and drugs? Star Trek TOS was made during a period of major social upheaval, multiple political assassinations and a major war costing the lives of tens of thousands of Americans. Did that series reflect the times and just remind everyone how miserable their world is now and how awful it will be in the future? Of course not. Star Trek wouldn't be remembered as anything if it were just that which is exactly why Picard doesn't deserve to be remembered or even canonized. Hardly anything new in sci fi deserves to be canoninzed given the lack of any kind of creative discipline so that the artistic merit of the work can outshine the endless hamfisted attempts at preaching and virtue signalling that buries the \"entertainment\". The best way to achieve social change through art is by PRODUCING SOMETHING WORTH PEOPLE'S ATTENTION, NOT ABUSING FRANCHISES THAT ALREADY EXIST.Star Trek presented a future where all the human race resolved its conflicts and when a message wanted to be said in a story, they used aliens still grappling with the problems the world was in back in the 20th century. The people on the ship speak to them from experience because it was a part of their PAST. Any prejudices among the humans is with aliens and vice versa because their feelings come from a lack of understanding. No one now producing Star Trek product is intelligent enough to understand that basic point and grasp Rodenberry's concet. The result is making Picard which is lazy garbage.I can't believe I prefer watching the worst of 2nd season Space 1999, Jason of Star Command, or even Star Maidens for crying out loud over Picard. I'll take corny crap over depressing crap any day.","rating":"1\/10","date":"16 August 2021"}
{"title":"Don't let the naysayers sway you!","review":"I write this review only to combat the stream of negative reviews. It seems those leaving such reviews wanted their star trek, only their Star Trek and in their limited, narrow views cannot see that humanity isn't just nobleness, kindness, curiosity and the search for truth. In many ways we are doomed to repeat the mistakes of the past, a circle of violence, grief, understanding and change. This series demonstrates this beautifully. Previous star treks were set in a universe where humanity had reached its maximum potential, however, humanity it still was and therefore still subject to negative change.Great story, great acting, great effects, well edited.

Like many people, season 2 was so cheesy, weak and poorly written that it nearly had me switch off before getting to season 3. That would have been a mistake.In season 3 they ditch (almost) all the superfluous, one dimensional new cast (who add nothing to the story or trek universe) and bring back the original crew who add depth to a compelling story line.

And they were responsible for death of thousands, regardless of any conspiracy - the were controlled, changed to do horrible things, hence the androids were to blame, and therefore the ban was justified.And Picards has ONE person to point to - Data, \"look androids are safe\".Stupid script.And it gets worse, our android \"hero\" actually tries to call the super-androids, and wants to end all life to save androids...\nPicards saves the day, by a nice speech and everyone is just fine.Eh, what? Can you really forgive someone that tried to kill all humans?And shows NO remorse at all.My fear would have been \"safe until next time\".Next time someone does something that upsets her...No Romulans had it figured out, they were the good people and all androids should be killed instantly.","rating":"6\/10","date":"29 January 2022"}

With this latest twist on an ever expanding universe Picard suddenly resurfaces telling bits and pieces from bygone times.The introduction of a new cyborg which has made close to human intregued me so I kept on watching to the point that the basic storyline shifted further away from suspense to a typical love story filled with intregues and deceit. (Quite predictable and utterly boring impo).So this season dragged on and on without being anywhere near interesting than it promised to be in the beginning. Instead the characters became more and more dislikeable (so many characters with personal issues).The story writers must have clearly be on something and it ain't inspiration i'm referring about here if anyone's wondering..\nThe one thing that kept me from quitting is the promise of seeing the Borg return once more. Other than that, it just felt hollow and depressive to a certain point really.If additional seasons should arrive, i hope they hired a proper screenwriter this time.If not, well i'll just stay with the Good Old Star Trek Voyager series instead!","rating":"6\/10","date":"18 January 2022"}
{"title":"10 episodes to tell a story that should have been a 2 episode at best.","review":"Once again the ball has been completely dropped in a new Star Trek show\/movie.Apart from some of the previous actors and the nostalia they carry, this is nothing like the classic Star Trek, while also not bringing anything new and original to the series.The side characters are meaningless, feels like Picard could have went on his own on the mission and the outcome would have been the same.I have no idea who these new people are and I don't care what happens to them. One episodic character from the classics had more personality and involvement in the plot that these people had in 10 episodes.Then there's the Borg, so much hype in the trailer, so much hype to see them, only for it to lead nowhere, their presense was nothing more than a taxi service.Whoever owns the Star Trek rights now has a hard time understanding what made it great. Pro tip: it wasn't lazers and sword fights. It was the characters and their relations, their dialogue, their rapport.Also what's up with all the damn lens flares? When did actual cinematic vision go into the dumpster and it was decided that blasting a light as high as you can in the middle of an indoor scene adds any value? Just stop. It's annoying.Since we're all in lockdown\/isolation\/quarantine, I guess you can watch it, after you're done watching all the older Star Trek series, Battlestar Galactica, Babylon 5, all the Stargate series(including Universe, it gets better before they cancel it), and Duck Dodgers.

It's not for anyone else that does not have the nostalgia for that show with all its goods and bads. With this consideration, the acting, the effects, the script are stellar; outside this context there is nothing worth discussing.However there is one thing that plagues the entire show, the Rafaella character played by Michelle Hurd. Nothing about her is from the same universe as everything else, nothing fits, everything she does is wrong. I really do not know if it is an utterly poor choice of the actor, or she got the bad luck of getting a role that does not fit her. She might be a great actor in her own right but for this show she's a disaster, she destroys it. I really am sorry for the show and for her as well.

As a matter of fact Picard is 90% of the run time.The shows plot is serviceable, don't get me wrong. From the second they drop enough hints you can put two and two together, BUT the reveal isn't treated as big, just matter of fact. (Mainly cause there's a TNG episode where all the characters had their shock at the idea)There's a glorious scene of Picard ranting about a \"self serving Starfleet\" and not only is it the best acted scene in the episode, but it also (very clearly) is addressing criticism of New Trek.I didn't grow up when the shows were initially airing, but thanks to streaming services I grew up with the shows.

I love both of those formulas, so it's a feature, not a bug. And it has Picard, and it's set in the Star Trek Universe.

For me, this is slow enough to linger in my thoughts long after a viewing and that's a precious thing.\nNothing's perfect here, everyone's flawed and everyone's right in their own minds, just like real life.\nI find the storyline fascinating and even though I know that the greater good will triumph, as ever in Star Trek, I still feel the assorted tensions as the series builds to a climax.\nI've been with Star Trek from the beginning (don't care much for the films and Voyager though) and feel blessed to be enjoying this rare gem. What a treat!","rating":"10\/10","date":"13 March 2020"}
{"title":"Star Trek Picard: Mass Effect Edition","review":"I watched the entire first season and at the end of the day all I can say is that this plot was lifted straight from Mass Effect. Beat for beat, and nearly word for word too. That's not a bad thing. Mass Effect is a brilliant piece of science fiction, which can also credit its success to Battle Star and Star Trek. The issue here is that Star Trek is always the tend setter. It's what pushes the envelope for science fiction. For some reason, Star Trek Picard plays fifth fiddle in a genre where it has already set the foundation.Star Trek Picard lifts the biggest plot beats from Mass Effect:1) Synthetic lifeforms are seen as pariahs and a danger to organic life in the galaxy.2) Ancient synthetic lifeforms can only be contacted via a deep space signal.3) Said deep space signal scrambles the brains of organics, driving them to insanity.4) Ancient synthetic lifeforms are lying in wait in some uncharted region of space, ready to destroy all spacefaring civilizations in the galaxy.5) Every politician and spacefaring government doesn't care\/believe\/or trust the protagonist's warnings about galaxy wide genocide.6) A secret organization is trying to stop the ancient synthetics.I could go on, but you get the point. This show had a lot of promise, but in the end, it was basically just a TV remake of the Mass Effect trilogy.","rating":"6\/10","date":"28 March 2020"}
{"title":"boring","review":"Very stretched, very tedious and boring. Where did the dynamics, exciting stories, variety and unique atmosphere go? I just didn't have the patience, so I stopped watching. Each season I hoped that drive and energy would appear, but no. A very boring show for retirees... It's a pity that the show has turned into a dummy. Obviously, the budget was small, the scriptwriters wrote boring texts, filled the show with empty endless dialogues with incomprehensible meanings. All this could have been packed into a couple of episodes, instead of several seasons. There is no desire to watch the third season, most likely it will be the same. And this is at best.","rating":"3\/10","date":"25 February 2023"}
{"title":"Ignore the low scores, a brilliantly made show","review":"People harking back to the original series are just nostalgic, maybe they should sit in front of their repeats rather than write reviews.

{"title":"No expectation","review":"Iv read a ton of reviews saying Picard and Discovery aren't Star Trek. And it's true there not but I don't really see how anyone could expect them to be. My husband is a die hard fan. He's seen them all and can quote them if he can find something relatable. So Iv only been watching Star Trek for 8 years. Voyager was my favorite but my husband LOVED Jean Luke. So we were so excited to watch it and...We loved it. And here's why....we didn't expect it to be like Star Trek. We live in a different time then when these show were made. They can't just pick up where they left off. It's not logical \u00f0\u0178\u02dc\u2030 we choose to see it for what it was not hold it to an unattainable standard of greatness like the previous shows. Its because we loved his character and while a lot has certainly changed about the show his character hasn't. It's just had to adapt to the new culture.","rating":"9\/10","date":"14 January 2021"}
{"title":"Expertly sets the foundation for a new Trek story","review":"To all the reviewers who have lamented this is not Star Trek... they've missed one important point. Episodes 1-3 bring in a new award winning director to set the scene for a story we've not been part of for nearly 20 years, so in doing some of the familiar Star Trek elements haven't materialised yet. However, in episode 3, then fully in episode 4, the baton is passed to Jonathan Frakes as the story develops.Picard is excellent, and very much the character we remember, if now wiser and more reflective at this point in his life. The whole production has been well worth the wait and you'll be pleased you gave this a go.","rating":"10\/10","date":"25 January 2020"}

{"title":"Entertaining but no longer groundbreaking.","review":"Since the death of Gene Roddenberry, the true Star Trek universe has collapsed. There is not much left of the actual philosophy. Which is not particularly surprising, if one recognizes today around which kind of humans it concerns with Hollywood & CO.Patrick Steward is an acceptable actor, but his time is over. You can clearly see that the increasing shortcomings of age are compensated with modern special effects. So one tries to maintain Star Trek around a man who has grown old and to reinvent it in the process. The old-established Trekkers gratefully accept this, but Gene was never primarily interested in inspiring the fans, but in drawing a world as it should be, but is not. Star Trek today is therefore without him no more than an expensive video game.","rating":"6\/10","date":"5 March 2022"}

{"title":"My second review after episode 6","review":"Episode 6 was probably the best since the opener. But I still rate this show very very low.\nBUT...there is finally some hope for development. I still don't care about most characters, I also think it is probably NOT worth watching to the end of the 10 promised episodes. BUT: we have yet to see all the characters and Riker is going to show up in episode 7. If nothing else, my decade long loyalty to the Star Trek universe keeps me watching. Loyalty can go very very far. I just hope I won't be the lemming that gets lured into the abyss of a terrible show (which is what it is now) and wastes precious hour after hour.\nWil Wheaton's review room after the show had Jeri Ryan as a guest. She is just such a great person and I hope they will use her positivity and sense of humor in her character. My feeling is STP just requires more humor and fun and finally people may tune in with interest. I read some of the shills (defending the show here on this board) that Star Trek of the past wasn't all that positive either. That it surely created nightmares in children after some episodes. And I admit remembering Picard getting tortured (how many lights were there?) - yet the boundaries were always very well defined. It was and always should be a family show folks can watch at home together. That the FCC doesn't apply to a streaming show is no excuse for uncalled gore as I hated seeing in episode 5.\nIn my opinion the show better steps up to the true nature of the franchise now. I am not alone in my power of possibly canceling my CBS All Access subscription. Star Trek Discovery managed to somewhat redeem itself with those last two episodes of the 2nd season. Finally, thanks to the lead Michael.My point: I won't give Jean-Luc that much time in Star Trek Picard.","rating":"7\/10","date":"5 March 2020"}

{"title":"Eagerly awaiting season 2!","review":"What the hell people?? A bunch of haters writing 1 and 2 star reviews? This show is pretty good, it ties together different parts of the Trek universe, has good writing, great acting, and great action sequences. It is NOT TNG, TOS, Voyager, or any other series. It is its own animal, with a terrible occurrence in the Federation leading to horrible consequences. But in walks Jean Luc Picard, aging and frail, to lead a group of misfits to try to prevent a bleak future. It is fun, exciting, and ultimately hope-filled.Do not watch if you are expecting the simplicity of TNG, you won't find that here. The show and it's plot are complicated and thought provoking.My actual rating is about 8 out of 10. I rated it higher to balance out some of the hate.","rating":"10\/10","date":"13 March 2021"}
{"title":"Season 3 based around a poorly thought-out gimmick","review":"So, back in ToS, Kirk would face off against planet killers and Gods. Things that were enough in the way of enigmatic origin that you could say \"Yeah... they display a power would be a real challenge to deal with\" . Enter Season 3 of Picard where they are facing against a \"Bounty Hunter\" that has a list of weapons that reads like the grocery list for an armada...ON ONE SHIP!!! This thing could, quite literally, one-shot a dreadnaught. That's quite \"impressive\" for a civilian vessel. \"Impressive\" like Somalian Pirates flying around in flying saucers with death-ray \"Impressive\". Yet nowhere has anyone remarked yet how ridiculous it is. Then I started to realize how filler oriented the series indeed is. Too much mucking around with little pay-off. The laziness doesn't end with the \"Bounty Hunter from God\".... It has been there all along. Padding out a series based around a list of characters we all remember from TNG. Playing upon nostalgia to collect some extra residuals. For the most part, I didn't mind. For the most part, it was time well wasted. Yet when writing goes from a poorly thought-out gimmick to outright insulting its own audience... it's just offensive.","rating":"6\/10","date":"8 March 2023"}
{"title":"It's disgusting to see how bad this show is","review":"The writing quality is insanely bad. I don't know this got greenlit.\nIf you compare Picard to TNG\/Voyager\/DS9, it's like comparing The Room with a masterpiece.It's truly sad. You don't even need to examine the show in details. The flaws are so obvious.I don't think I've ever seen writing more lazy than this. How the hell is it possible for this to be so bad with such a high budget? Did they spend everything on the intro or something?Magic device that can fix anything with the power of imagination?

OPINION :Quite excited to see how the Borg tie in, I assume they being part machine will not agree with star fleets take on synthetics. I can see seven and Hugh being freedom fighters against this romulan group, who seem to be interested in destroying synthetics. I see Picard trying to bring the federation back to the days of TNG as I suspect they have moved to the right, due to the destruction of Mars. I can already see them using a blend of strengths from the previous Star Trek series.

{"title":"Season 1 was good, but Season 2 is probably Star Trek at it's finest ever","review":"For me, as someone who grew up with TNG, the recent Star Trek productions were missing a soul and felt more like Star Wars than the Utopia Gene Roddenberry probably dreamed of. Season 1 was not bad, it was amazing to see the so long missed faces again, however the plot didn't really convince me to be worthy of Picard. Then came Season 2 and just after 2 episodes, I feel like I'm watching the best Star Trek ever done. Everything calibrated itself here. The story and visuals are cinematic. The dialogues, thanks to the return of Q are intelligent and a joy to watch. Can't wait for the next week to watch the next episode :)","rating":"10\/10","date":"12 March 2022"}
{"title":"Thoughtful, beautiful and steady!","review":"Star Trek Picard's premiere episode, Remembrance takes a meaningfully-paced and character centered approach to introduce us to a new era in the post super nova world where Jean-Luc makes a life for himself at home in his French villa. Lots of meaningful nods to the series and hook-you-in conversations make the storyline instantly interesting. With sprinkles of 23rd Century technology that you'd expect to see and an insanely cinematic experience that leaves you breathless, this is excellent TV and undeniably Star Trek. Sir Patrick Stewart and Isa Briones bring the entire show on fire! Touching, shocking and with a hint of magic!","rating":"10\/10","date":"24 January 2020"}
{"title":"Watch only season 3!","review":"I watched the first few episodes of season 1, couldn't finish it. I didn't even bother watching season 2. When I heard all the rave reviews from fans about season 3, I gave it another chance and was pleasantly surprised. It's excellent. While I was happy with how the original 90s series ended, it's still a lot of fun to see the old gang back again.Season 3 of \"Picard\" admirably fixed a lot of the mistakes that have been made after \"Star Trek: First Contact\", when the Next Generation franchise went into decline. There were a couple of things that bothered me in season 3. I wasn't completely convinced with Dr. Beverly Crusher's reasoning for avoiding her friends. Also, characters that were supposed to never age or age very slowly were given excuses for their new wrinkles. So, do I prefer this new finale to the original series finales? No... but it's a fun nostalgic ride and would make any 90s Star Trek fan happy.","rating":"","date":"30 April 2023"}
{"title":"Maybe a decade too late","review":"I'm an out and out Trekkie, I've watched all variations and love or loathe them they have their place. Obviously we are just one episode in so plenty of time to get a better feel for how this will unwind.There are genuine scenes where Patrick Stewart looks frail, I'm guessing at close to 80 years of age that he doesn't need to act too hard to pull that off. It's sad to see the once proud Picard be a shadow of his former self!The rest of the cast so far are just empty characters but all in all not totally dislikable.These things will take time, it took TNG a whole first season to get out of the starting blocks.Obviously there is huge expectations for this show and that makes it difficult to compare against the heights of TNG.This show needs to shake of the frail aspect of the Picard character, I'm not expecting headstands or bullet time action from Picard, just less knocking on heavens door.As from the first episode, it might of been better to have made this 10years ago \uf8ff\u00fc\u00f2\u00e2","rating":"7\/10","date":"24 January 2020"}

{"title":"Not nearly as good as TNG","review":"When this show first started Patrick Stewart said he did not want to bring back all of the old cast from TNG because he did not want this show to be like TNG. Congratulations! You were successful at creating a show about a character who is a shadow of his former self.Is it just me or does it seem that Picard, at his advanced age, is doing more action scenes than he did as his younger self in TNG? It seems like the writers tried to make up for the lack of story with some boring and awkward action sequences. Why is an elderly Picard taking such a hands on approach to solving issues in this series. I also don't like that Picard doesnt seem to receive the same respect as he did in TNG, which is ridiculous! Given all that he's done for Starfleet his character should be way more respected than he is.The only reason I give this show a 7 is because of the end of season 3. The writers did what they said they would not do (probably because the ratings were falling so they had nothing lose). They brought back all of the old characters. That episode with the old crew on the on old ship was the best episode of this entire show so far and it is the only reason I give Star Trek: Picard a 7. Had it not been for that episode, I would rate this show at 6.","rating":"7\/10","date":"2 February 2024"}
{"title":"A sad epilogue to a great TV series.","review":"As a fan of Next Generation, this was disappointing for me. I didn't expect greatness, but thought it would be at least watchable.I thought wrong.Star Trek: Picard\" is mind-numbingly dull and pretentious, featuring a host of forced, artificial characters and situations, newly-created Trek mythology that it takes too seriously, and lots of talk, talk, talk, and more talk.It is without question, the worst Star Trek I have ever seen. I somehow managed to get through about five episodes of Season 1, continually hoping it would get better, or that something would at least happen! Couldn't take it anymore, so I jumped ahead to an episode featuring Jonathan Frakes and Marina Sirtis reprising their roles as Riker and Troi, to see how they fared. Couldn't even watch all of that, so I only watched the parts they were in...but it wasn't worth it.Picard's relationships with the other characters are just not convincing, and there is no chemistry between any of them. At his age he apparently isn't participating in any serious action scenes, so he just meanders around being haunted by his past and trying to find a cause to fight for, deferring much of the minimal action to the younger cast of boring characters.Jean-Luc's newfound quest involves androids who don't know they're androids, who are from the same android line as Data, who has \"died.\"\nThe story takes soooooooo long to get anywhere it is difficult to stay awake, but if you do, you will encounter a number of contrived and uninteresting convolutions, incorporating political intrigue at Starfleet, a deactivated Borg cube being used for research, and stuff from Picard's past. Along the way, you will, of course, be subjected to the fake alien languages and cultures that are so obligatory and laughably solemn in Star Trek.You will also meet those joining Picard on his journey, including a woman with whom Picard has a history, and a cocky mercenary-type galactic-adventurer guy, who is an obvious (and embarrassing) rip-off of Han Solo.It would be unrealistic (and overly optimistic) to expect these endless Star Trek mutations and rehashes to go away anytime in the near future, but when Star Trek starts using Star Wars as source material, it really is time to retire the franchise.","rating":"2\/10","date":"31 December 2021"}
{"title":"It deserves an 8","review":"Of all the new Star Treks this is up there with Strange New Worlds though I think this beats it just slightly. Both are far better then the crying Burnham show called Discovery that breaks every Star Trek cannon other than the reboot movies.This could have been so much better had they kept the characters as who they are. In season three they start to break away from what actually happened in the past and make up their own storyline. The one that got me was how Riker and Jean Luc argue in season three and completely forget that they were an efficient team together. People who worked on such a team in rl will know that personal ties do not break down so easily. The writers do not know the characters they are writing for. The thing the writers have done well was in making a more true to life universe for them to react in while, for the most part, keeping Star Fleet values. I also like how they followed the invasion scenario that was attempted in STNG. They reworked it with known entities and put together a great storyline that management back in the 90's refused to follow. As much as we the fans wanted it to continue, the management had good reason not to follow it with how dark it was. I do think they are touching on the dark side a bit much but so far they are making it work.That is why I am giving it an 8, with all the character wrongs, they are still making it work. I also like how they have a reason when characters start to shed a tear vs Burnham crying at the drop of a hat. They completely ignore what star fleet is and the training star fleet personnel have to have in order to serve on a ship.Lastly, I am worried with how Patrick Stewart has aged. You can tell in some scenes how old he is. Sometimes you see him go off balance or is too feeble to do a scene. I commend him for still acting for the fans. I'd rather see him than have a show that goes off on its own with a new character. In essence I think this series is a great tribute to all of Star Trek. It respects the ST universe even with the mistakes it makes vs other new versions.","rating":"8\/10","date":"18 March 2023"}
{"title":"Outstanding","review":"I have been a Star Trek fan from the beginning. Grew up watching the original series, plus the movies that followed. Didn't watch too many of the spin-offs, until Discovery and then Picard. The F-Bombs and violence has seemed to have upset a lot of die-hard Trekkies, which is understandable. However the grittiness that has been added only helps to enhance the show. I love the way series (and movie) crossovers, guest appearances and name drops of previous characters are incorporated (in both Picard and Discovery).

There's potential there but all his heartfelt speeches are empty and listless.The whole thing is slow, and so easy to lose focus and lose track track of the story.There's no jeopardy because you know in the end the good guys will win and the story is not good enough that you can forget that and enjoy the ride.","rating":"","date":"15 April 2023"}
{"title":"To question sanity for sanity's sake?","review":"A disturbing message held within Season 2, Season 1 was to me amazing, placing Picard and all others in a pleasant distraction. Season 2 on the other hand seemed to remove everything that Star Trek stands for, diversity, individualism, love, hate, action and make a psychological thriller of emotional proportions. Had to fast forward in many parts, why? I could not understand the emotions, yes I understood the story line and it is about the Admiral and he does have monsters in his closet, but please don't ruin our memory of him.There is certain pointers to the world we find ourselves in, it shows the strengths and weaknesses of people within the series and in real life. A worthy watch, expect more analysis than action. Interesting outcome for 7 and Picard. It seems we have alternative timelines available to bring into play.

Just turned 70 and grew up with the whole Star Trek thing - fake planets, rocks, monsters in zip up costumes and of course loved it. Kirk, Spock et all, my heroes. Most of the films I found so so, most of the follow up series so so. Sometimes they were just too moralising, too black and white, sometimes even sickly in the goody-two-shoes characters. Now finally an excellent, realistic, well acted and well told story within the Universe of Star Trek that has me enthralled more and more with each show (despite the slow pacing sometimes - so what? A good story needs to be well paced) and come on al you boohoo moaners, look a the best effects ever and most of all the excellent Patrick Stewart. First Logan, now Picard - love the man.

The pure power of Patrick Stewart's presence elevates what very easily could have been a sad attempt by an old guy to grab those last 15 minutes of fame. Maybe both Picard and Stewart ARE grasping for that last hurrah, but if so, I am happy to be along for the ride. When Picard says in the episode \"Broken Pieces\" that he had \"forgotten how much he loved this\" (referring to space travel) you can't help but wonder if it is really Patrick Stewart being reminded how much he loves being Picard. I never forgot and am overjoyed to experience it again.The best of it: 1. Patrick Stewart. If you've still got it, why not use it?\n2. The callbacks. Objects and characters from across the different iterations. It does a nerdy soul good.\n3. The casting. Every character is perfect for their role. The bad guys are loathsome, the good guys are flawed but loveable. The accents are fun and, if not good, at least not laughable or distracting.\n4. The special effects. They are (with notable exceptions) subtle but beautiful and convincing.The worst: 1. The ridiculous amount of time that is wasted. This is an online series. If we don't remember what happened before, we can easily rewatch the previous episode. Save us the extensive recap. Also, the self-indulgent (though lovely) TWO MINUTE LONG title sequence would have been great, shown once, in the pilot. To take up that much story time every episode is narcissistic and annoying.\n2. The difficult to follow back stories and storyline in early episodes. This does get better as it goes along. By \"Broken Pieces\" I feel like I have a good grip on what's going on.\n3. Maybe I'm old but walking around F-bombing may be cute when you're 20 but for educated, civilized people in their 50s, 60s, 80s to be casually effing in normal conversation just sounds contrived and unnecessary.\n4. The level of graphic violence in that one episode was excessive and very un-Trek-like and I hope it is not repeated.7\/10- I recommend for all who are longtime fans and can \"get\" the callbacks. Very young and\/or non-fans may find it too slow and too hard to follow.","rating":"7\/10","date":"12 March 2020"}

I didn't like the first season and this second season is equally as poor.

We Trekkors seek some kind of resolution at least in three episodes and \"Ya' keep me hangin' on\".\"Discovery\" does that and is much more enjoyable.Time to give way to the younger generation or write better stuff for the old man.\n\"Short Treks\" is just plain fun.","rating":"7\/10","date":"26 February 2020"}

Star Trek has so much potential why do they continue to butcher it with ST:P and ST:D? The writing is just unbearable, it's so bad and cheap. I'm canceling my Paramount + I just cannot stand what they are doing to this show. I now hold a deep resentment to whoever allowed this to happen and am boycotting this company.

{"title":"Its the Ups and Downs that make it so.","review":"I remember falling across a Facebook Star Trek fan page when the first season aired. I said: '...the Romulans said \"where are the others?\"' and suggested to them that this meant there were many androids out there that could be as evil as Lore. The group administrator, who was dressed as The Doctor in Voyager, doubted it.That idea was shouted down...but that's what happened nonetheless. I loved the first few episodes but then it started to plod. The Season 2 opener has far more avenues at its disposal. People are already complaining that Picard isn't acting like a super strong, super fast android. First off, he wasn't designed to be, if you listened carefully enough to the Season One closer, and I doubt Q will allow that to continue to be the case anyway.What Picard has a chance to do here is go where Discovery didn't, very sadly. Discovery had a great dual reality storyline at the beginning, but then it was thrown aside for some pretty boring stuff, which wasn't interesting and lasted too long.Q's reintroduction could open endless possibilities which could directly draw on TNG origin stories....and I really hope they don't screw this up!That said, its a very interesting start...but the trial never ends...UPDATED\nNow we're into the final season there are immediately two burning questions: where's Wesley Crusher, momentarily spotted in Season 2 and why didn't they just reunite the cast from the beginning?Wesley is easy: they showed he was still a traveler and not particularly interested in human conflict. That's important because if Wesley rescued his Mother this season would be over in about twenty seconds. Then why didn't they unite earlier is a harder question to answer. I don't think Raffi or Cristobal were particularly interesting characters. You have to care about a character's survival and, so far, I don't,So here we go. Professor Moriarty has appeared along with Eric Bana's nightmare ship from the Star Trek movie canon with Chris Pine. Whereever we go, whether it's boldly or not, I really hope this lives up to its promise because, in many ways, they've struck out in the two previous seasons. There is a line which talks of the enemy always being something different. My best guess at this point is that they adapt themselves to the psyche of what the protagonists fear.Time will tell.","rating":"9\/10","date":"7 March 2022"}
{"title":"Thankfully it's not monster of the week anymore","review":"Season one of any series is rough because you're just starting the story, getting to know the characters. Not all Star Trek fans enjoyed the weekly moral dilemma, or monster of the week. We want an actual story line that builds suspense.I think TNG showed what star fleet was about, and this is showing that the future isn't as perfect as star fleet would have people believe. Not all of societies problems have been solved with miracle cures, and there are people that aren't as polished as a ship that is run in a military fashion. They said before this series came out it would nothing like TNG and people are complaining it's not like TNG. Even Patrick steward said he didn't want it to be like the old episode. What they are trying to do is make a Star Trek for everyone young or old, genuine fan base or getting new fans.I personally loved to see the other side of the future, what is more realistic and not all \"Prime Directive\" this and \"Miracle hypo spray cure\" that.","rating":"10\/10","date":"18 November 2020"}

I stayed with her for 2 weeks every summer and if it rained you had to stay inside and watch\/listen to them every weekday. Nothing but continuous monotony. The \"Picard\" shows I watched, like the soaps my grandmother watched\/listened to, drags on and on and on, adding some little tid bit of information but never resolving anything.

{"title":"It hasn't been very good so far, other than a few moments in the pilot and now quite enjoyable\/moving ep 6","review":"This series is completely serial as opposed to episodic, so it already isn't going to feel like older trek. Being mostly serial was not the reason Discovery didn't work, not to mention Discovery was episodic at times. So trudge through those first 5 in Picard and make it to 6 before you stop. If you're as happy with what they achieved on 6 as I was, then let's give 7 and 8 another chance. If by the end of 8 it slumps back down and loses this magical recipe they cooked up in 6, then I won't blame people for thinking Picard is as bad as Discovery. By the way, what'd the deal with these CBS people hiring black women who overact? They keep hiring these actresses that are contributing to dragging these new treks down and yet Whoopi won't be on until season 2? Are these producers on drugs? Maybe it's a matter of these directors not knowing how to direct women in general? Most of the female performances come off on these CBS treks in general as being either stale, inauthentic, or overacted, now that I think of it. Maybe they need Bryce Dallas Howard or Roxann Dawson to do some directing. Maja Vrvilo seems to have finally done something with the men, at least.","rating":"6\/10","date":"28 February 2020"}
{"title":"There's... Kurtzman on the starboard bow, starboard bow, starboard bow...scrape him off Jim!","review":"Yeah, I know, using The Firm's Star Trek song lyrics is a low blow, but when you feel the need to search Youtube for that song to erase the memory of each episode of Picard you've just watched, what can you do?ST:Picard is just a continuation of the Not-Trek that began with the JJ Abrams movies reboots and the awful ST:Dicovery show. It's sci-fi, but it isn't really Star Trek and no amount of shoehorning old characters into it will change that.Star Trek was always about a hopeful future for humanity, where we had overcome all out prejudices and bigotry and become a force for good in the galaxy.ST:Picard, on the other hand, reverses all this and now the Federation are basically isolationist a-holes that are willing to let entire species die because \"we don't help our enemies\" (This is actually stated in episode two). It's as if no one involved in this show ever watched ST: The Undiscovered Country.What this show is, and not even remotely trying to be subtle about it, is political and societal posturing by the writers and even by Patrick Stewart hinself. They've made no secret of the fact that it is meant to be a mishmash of everything wrong with society at the moment. I just wish they had writers that understood that beating your audience about the head with your idealogical leanings will have the exact opposite effect, even if they somewhat share those ideologies.What Picard feels like is... well, you know that scene in the Simpsons where Grandpa Simpson shakes his stick angrily at a cloud? Well this feels like that, only after he did that, someone gave him a job writing for television. Picard feels like that. Like grumpy old Abraham Simpson wrote it. It's miserable and dark, full of overdone societal commentary and politics and utterly NOT-Trek.Let's be clear, because Star Trek WAS always about such societal commentary, but it did it in a subtle way. A subtle way that was actually made more effective by having our future human descendants be almost perfect. The Federation of the older Trek shows was the shining beacon of how society should be, against which, all other societies (with their flaws) could be contrasted quite markedly in order to get across whatever the message of the week was.This new Trek has none of that guile, instead being intent on brow-beating the viewer with the issues of the day whilst showing our future as being anything other than hopeful and bright. It's depressing, honestly, and very tiring to watch. Am I in the minority of people that want to watch this sort of thing to forget about the real world, even if only for an hour or so at a time?It's early days yet, for this show, and I know Kurtzman only really had input into the first four episodes, so it might improve as the season goes on. However, right now its dreary and miserable. Even Picard's presence doesn't help, since Patrick Stewart seems to no longer be playing Picard, but only Himself at the moment.I also suspect that his role will be minimal as the show progresses. Oh, he'll be there, but mostly everything will be done by the show's new, younger cast. He's really only going to be there to legitimise the show as Star Trek. Same for the other older Star Trek cast that have become involved in this. Just there to add legitimacy to the show, hang around for half-an-episode (if you're lucky) and then gone forever. Picard, I feel, will be a guest-star on his own show.Whilst I'm picking holes in this...episode two. What kind of lazy-ass prop department uses a 3D printer as a replicator, then can't even be bothered to remove the (clearly visible) 3D printing parts (print-head\/carriage and motors) from said printer before delivering a CLOSE-UP scene of that \"replicator\". I can't even begin to describe how little care and attention that makes me feel is going into this show, hence my feeling that it is going to go downhill quite rapidly.And another thing that is bugging me... Romulans. Has no one who is playing a Romulan in this show ever seen any episode of older Trek involving the Romulans? Or were they actually directed to act like humans all the time? Because so far, none of the Romulans are acting like Romulans, just like humans with pointy-ears.EDIT: So we're up to episode 8 and there's been swearing, graphic torture and the murder of TNG\/Voyager characters without any good reason. It's pretty dire. The pacing in the later episodes is all over the place. The editing makes it clear there were plenty of reshoots and through it all, women tell Picard off again and again. Even Troi does it. What a mess!EDIT FOR SEASON 3: Wow! Talk about a night and day change! S3 of Picard is probably what we all hoped for when the series was first announced. Unlike S1\/2 it IS actual Star Trek, and it's pretty good! Like my tag line above, all it took was scraping Kurtzman off the show's metaphorical boot and putting someone competent in charge, in this case Terry Matalas. Who could have guessed that putting someone in charge who has worked on previous Trek (DS9 etc.) would fix a sinking ship? Anyway, it is decent, watchable Trek now. I'd give S3 a solid 8 rating. The rest... well the rest of this review still stands for S1\/2.I can't help but feel so long as Bad Robot, Abrams, Kurtzman et al are involved with Trek, nothing worthwhile will emerge.SUMMARY: More NOT-Trek from Kurtzman. Picard who isn't Picard, Romulans that act like humans. Godawful contemporary cursing. Exhausting to watch pseudo-drama painted to look like Star Trek (by a painter that's never seen Star Trek). Not really recommended.RECOMMENDATION: DO NOT WATCH Seasons 1 and 2 if you loved Star Trek. Start at Season 3 and pretend the rest was a bad fever dream... A really BAD fever dream!","rating":"4\/10","date":"30 January 2020"}

I really enjoyed it and it was very hard to not binge it in two days.I think that anybody who gives it 4 or less and is a star trek fun, they just feel disappointed due to nostalgia reasons as they are wating for another TNG instead of these smaller story driven shows but if you look at this show independently with great references to TNG characters and events, it is actually great for any star trek fan!","rating":"9\/10","date":"9 January 2022"}

{"title":"So bad i couldn't watch TNG for a while afterwards","review":"I really tried to like this...I REALLY REALLY tried to like this...considering Picard is possibly the greatest Captain but after watching this i couldn't even watch TNG for a while afterwards as all i kept seeing when i saw Picard was this atrocity.I weird thing in regards to the nostalgia trip is that all the other known Star Trek characters are what you expect them to be...except Picard.Considering we are talking sci-fi here, which stretches believability at the best of time, this rates around minus 9000 on the believability scale. Whether it is Picard going from a Pariah of the Federation in one series to being fully accepted back into the fold without anyone batting an eyelid in the next, to 7 of 9 jumping into a car wondering how it works and then instantly becoming an expert stunt driver. Picard is a classic case of not letting story, continuity or any sense of believability get in the way of the excitement. This is made worse by the fact that Star Trek was generally so good as while far fetched it would base itself in science and reality so you could relate to it and it felt believable. Picard takes that whole ethos and beams it into space.The worst part of the believability is the second series where they travel a back to our time and all I can say about the believability factor is they must have assumed Trump would have won the last election if this is what America was meant to be like.Possibly the worst part overall is that Star Trek has always been a character driven franchise and none of the characters made any impact on me. Instead of being the centre which the story spins around they seem more like bit parts crowbarred in to add some faces to the story. When i hear about actors being concerned about AI taking over and them no longer being needed, when you look at the characters in Picard i am sure AI could have done better. I don't blame the actors as they generally work within the script but for real human actors to stay relevant in an AI creative world the characters they play need to stand out which starts with good witing.If your looking for some Star Trek, this is not it. If your looking for more Picard or more TNG do not watch this series as it will ruin it for you.","rating":"2\/10","date":"13 June 2023"}

{"title":"Uneven but generally solid piece of Star Trek","review":"The latter years of Admiral Jean-Luc Picard's life.This is a mostly strong show that gives a fitting conclusion to the character's arc and provides the opportunity for some final adventures.The three seasons are fairly different, with the first establishing some new characters and giving Picard the opportunity to do something worthwhile with his twilight years. Picard the chief mediator and philosopher king reigns supreme in this one and he has some nice exchanges with familiar faces of TNG. One in particular that happens in the season finale is a franchise highlightSeason two is the weakest entry for me as it feels like a small amount of plot stretched over too many episodes. It starts well with a great set up during the first two chapters, before a time travel element is introduced and everything slows down with certain aspects feeling quite forced, particularly the humour.The third season abandons some characters and storylines to focus on paying tribute to the legacy of TNG and it's original crew. Jean-Luc Picard has a great arc and all main characters return for a solid final adventure. It arguably lacks originality, but only those who take life very seriously will fail to enjoy what the show runners are offering here.Patrick Stewart and Jeri Ryan are as great as they ever were in 90s Trek and numerous guest stars such as Brent Spiner, Jonathan Frakes, Lavar Burton, Gates McFadden, Marina Sirtis, Michael Dorn, Michelle Forbes, Tim Russ, Caryn Johnson, Jonathan Del Arco, and John de Lancie, appear for memorable cameos.Visually, it is much darker than anything shown in TNG and Voyager, but I think it does a great job of taking the established art design of classic Trek and giving it a modern feel, particularly during season 3.For me it's a 7.5\/10, but I like to round upwards.","rating":"8\/10","date":"21 April 2023"}
{"title":"I quickly disbanded the idea of this being a real Star Trek series","review":"However this show has real entertainment value for me. I understand the negative reviews and I can agree with them. But on that note, I would not throw the whole series away. It is true for me that when I see cgi done in a good way I am sort of hooked already and have the capacity to overlook huge plotholes. When I did not see a thing yet, I already had huge douds on why they chose Picard as the retired Star Trek captain. It is certainly not because of his acting, but he reminds me of the biggest storyline mistake of Star Trek writers. The Q continuum. There is nothing worse then a character that has unlimited godlike power over the universe. Any situation they would throw Picard in, in the back of your mind you would think that he could always depend on Q coming to the rescue. That would diminish any suspense they would build up too.6 episodes in, I do still like it.\nIf I really dig deep, then yes...what the negative reviews say holds true.\nBut just for being entertained it has sci fi quality,\nWith that I mean it has more then Stargate and maybe a lot less then Altered Carbon. The differences are different with individual comparisons and has to do with cgi, better overall production value, originality, etc.The takeaway is that a real Star Trek series that will satisfy old Star Trek fans will not be here for a long time.","rating":"","date":"27 March 2020"}

I absolutely loved TNG and was a go to show of mine while on active duty in the Marine Corps. I have great memories of watching that with my Brothers overseas. Anyway the series Picard is fantastic.... I love the fact most of the original TNG cast makes appearances throughout. It kind of feels like TNG is back in many ways and has been updated for 2023. If you liked the original TNG then you probably will also like Picard. For me Picard is Star Trek.... Kirk is great don't get me wrong. But Picard made me a Trekkie. You need to give it at least 4 episodes because it is a slow developing show. But after that you're in to the end.

So many great moments rewinded and enjoyed over and over again.And, despite the constant flood of new content coming from everywhere, I'm certain I'll watch season 3 again.Season 1? Kinda neat, but comparatively, lacks gravitas.Season 2 felt like an extended episode of CSI and, as it turns out, was entirely extraneous. It's like Paramount pretended it didn't happen when season 3 came around.Whether they forgot to pay off the ending of season 2, or decided to reverse course entirely, getting the old band back together for season 3 was everything I thought \"Picard\" could be, and more.Before watching it, I highly suggest a re-watch of TNG's finale (\"All Good Things...\") as it'll heighten your appreciation.As with Strange New Worlds, I just wish Paramount had the brains to make this show available legally in my country, so I could financially support it.","rating":"7\/10","date":"22 April 2023"}
{"title":"WTF Happened?","review":"Season One of Star Trek Picard was very good. It was arguably the best series on Paramount+. Being outstanding in a sea of uninspired mediocrity is an easy achievement but Picard was quite good.Emphasis on WAS. Season Two is just an awful mess. The first episode was so boring you may sleep through it. But watch it to the end and you can see a promise of great things to come.Unfortunately that promise was unfulfilled. You might be tempted to think \"went woke, got btoke\" but that's hardly the problem. The problem is any writers who throw this woke nonsense into a series to add relevance are just bad writers. In the 50+ years of Star Trek, it's been the most diverse, most inclusive set of series ever. Past series were sophisticated in how this inclusiveness and diversity were portrayed.Fans of The Next Generation will notice an unwelcome rewriting of Picard family history. Fans may also recall when the Enterprise visited 19th century San Francisco. This too, was deleted from history. Without adding spoilers, that's all I csn say.","rating":"5\/10","date":"27 September 2022"}

{"title":"Mid season review","review":"My initial impression is that this is an interesting concept for a star trek series, trying to go in a fresh direction to previous series', whilst still appealing with long time fans of star trek with call backs and cameos from the older series'\/films.It's great to see Picard back on screen again, Patrick Stewart is executive producer and it shows that its his ideas for the character at a later stage in life that are being explored.\nI expected the character to be seen as a legend\/veteran\/hero. So far, quite unexpectedly the majority of the other characters react to him fairly negatively. There are reasons for this in the plot, but it may be a bit jarring for fans of the TNG era to watch.\nThe main ensemble of characters are all fairly interesting, however I'm not getting a feeling of chemistry between them yet. Maybe it's too early in the series for that.Growing up, I saw star trek as my 'safe place' in that it was an optimistic view for the future, and complete escapism from life. This series feels very different to that. It has a pessimistic, dark feeling that makes it seem different to Gene Rodenberry's original vision for the show. This series is clearly trying to draw parallels to current events in order to push political agendas. While this may be more appealing to viewers new to star trek, it could alienate fans who have an emotional connection to the values and ethics the previous series' follow. I'm on the fence about this new direction. Although it makes the series feel relevant for today, it also seems disrespectful to Gene Rodenberry's legacy.Although I enjoy the fact that one overarching story is covered over the series, rather than the style of TNG when it was a new story each episode, it feels a little like the main mystery was uncovered in the first few episodes, partly through some clunky expositional dialogue between the villain characters that felt fairly forced. Half way through the series I feel like each episode is mainly 'filler' until the finale act and finale.Overall, I am enjoying the series. I think it has good potential, but perhaps hasn't quite found it's stride yet. Although it has flaws, I an definitely invested in the story and am intrigued to see where it goes.","rating":"6\/10","date":"21 February 2020"}

They all had values, a moral code of honor & (mostly) clean language.Dear Writers: are you trying to offend and ostracize any & everyone who may have a difference of opinion in worldview than you?! I lost count at the number of times a character said G. D. And your portrayal of ICE agents is unrecognizable to what they actually are. (Unless something drastic changes in the next 2 years.)\nYou shamelessly shove your agenda down our throats - something true ST writing never did.I'm saddened & disappointed at the direction of this franchise.I guess I should be thankful I have 7 seasons of TNG, DS9 & VOY.","rating":"1\/10","date":"12 June 2022"}

{"title":"Seriously? Did you expect a hunky dory STNG reunion?!","review":"I don't get what everyone is bickering about. I finally started watching and I was hooked from the very first second. I love that this series is something totally different. Remember, it's Star Trek: Picard. You're not interested in what has become of Jean-Luc? Don't watch it then, it's simple as that.I used to watch TNG as a kid and into my early teen years. I loved it back then and still sometimes watch episodes of it on Netflix. It's so soothing to be able to dive back into old days and feel like the fascinated kid again. Almost. Because like everyone else, I grew up and life happened to me. And as much as I would wish to be able to feel the exact same emotions I had back then... my adult mind throws a monkey ranch into my plans. And I notice that I am still am so very fond of the series, its characters and stories but something is missing while I watch it. It's probably the innocence of a child's fantasy and the unlimited capability of dreaming. And the na\u221a\u00d8ve belief that certain lessons TNG taught us would help humanity to improve (instead of dumbing down).However, I knew that watching Picard as an avid TNG fan was inevitable. And I think they made it perfect. It's totally different. It's got this movie flair about it and also a hint of \"Firefly\". And then there's Patrick Stewart... Jean-Luc. Meanwhile an admiral... but disappointed and exhausted from his last fight. An old Captain Picard who tries to find peace by living a life in reclusiveness but still gets haunted by nightmares in his sleep.This is not the Captain we knew and loved. This is an old man who simply gave up, who left everything and everyone he once loved and cared for behind. It's almost physically hurtful to see him like this... but I'm grateful for it. Anything else would have seemed fake. And after all it turns Jean-Luc is still as epic as he used to be. Just older, like all of us.I'm grateful that they didn't try to revive what once was. Three decades later, it wouldn't have made sense at all... It's a beautiful approach to show us a human Jean-Luc. It was important to distance from the happy go lucky sci-fi farytales. This was fine back then. It was just what I needed as a kid to escape reality sometimes. And to learn some important things about compassion, tolerance and morals.Star Trek: Picard is what I need right now. It's what my Adult-Me needs. An old new (or new old) Captain. Something totally different. With a hint of bittersweet emotions and memories. Something that goes a bit deeper and takes a bit more time and effort. A new adventure ... but a journey nonetheless. I feel sad for everyone who isn't able to see this.","rating":"10\/10","date":"15 November 2020"}

I would rush home from school to watch Star Trek Generations, Picard being the type of person I would deeply respect as my boss. The relationship between Will and Jean Luc is deep, if you have seen all of Generations you will know this. So comes Picard the series in the picture. I have watched all seasons with tears in my eyes. I grew up with these guys, i even copied Wills beard, which I say I still have and looks good on me, not quite as grey as Will's beard but close \uf8ff\u00fc\u00f4\u00c7 The jokes, the relationships between the characters all stem from knowing these figures inside out and having watched and grown up with them.

{"title":"Season 3 is the best Star Trek since 20 years","review":"And here is why:\nIt is written very smart. It's a reunion but it has so much more. Season 3 manages to put in all ingredients what made Star Trek really great. But... what is that? The same thing Seth Mcfarlane understood with The Orville. Telling a story with anthropological themes of today's time and age. The themes of season 3 are: network communication, generation gap and political infiltration (we live in a post democratic age where democracy has been infiltrated by capitalism). Demographics shows the decline of younger citizens in the western world but simultaneously youth, more and more turn against boomers, generation X and Y's. Due to global economic and environmental topics said generations induced. Season 3 tells a story of old farts trying desperately to protect youngsters from being instrumentalized by shapeshifters like Rhianna (Valerian portrayed her superb), or false (influencer) idols. But unfortunately we don't have a Jean Luc Picard and so youth will get more and more driven away in questionable ideologies and technical togetherness where in fact they get lonelier and lonelier. Great season in my opinion. Live long and prosper \uf8ff\u00fc\u00f1\u00f1\uf8ff\u00fc\u00e8\u00aa","rating":"6\/10","date":"12 June 2023"}
{"title":"All Bad Things","review":"Star Trek and its original vision of a positive future, chronicling the challenges and achievements of a far more advanced and enlightened humanity, has been fundamentally deformed into this silly, retrograde star dreck. In \"Picard,\" yet another once great cultural icon is toppled with the insipid pandering and kitschy bombast of a corporate media giant bent on devouring the last vestiges of authenticity and true creative enterprise.It's difficult to know exactly where to begin sifting through the detritus of this incoherent, steaming heap of refuse. For starters, the childishly awkward use of swear words reflects the limited intelligence and non-existent creativity of the writers. They must suppose the drooling screengazers in lala land are much like themselves and can't tell the difference between compelling stories and bright n' shiny cgi. So why not cater to the lowest common denominator? Evidently the hacks responsible for this drivel can't even be bothered to establish their own original stories and characters with which to bungle. They derive much more immediate gratification demolishing the works of superior creatives who came before them. \"Picard\" is an erratic morass of dimwitted hyperbole, preposterous contrivances, and the hysterical yammerings of lobotomized space brains. \"Picard\" himself is the utterly deconstructed and metaphysically vandalized burning man of the writers' room. At various points I'd ask myself if Kurtzman might have experienced a traumatic psychological disassociation in childhood, somehow centered on the original Picard character; if this \"Picard\" was the subconsciously manifested Lynchian doppelganger in the forgotten dream of a disembodied mind in a parallel reality; if the writers had eaten too many special mushrooms and brownies to know where they were and what they were doing.Sad to see this once noble, inspiring character fall into the corporate media abyss. This corrupted antipicard, and the miserable future he inhabits, is the pathetic reflection of a society in a state of decline and decay. He is the personification of the intellectual stultification and creative bankruptcy of the writers and producers of this series, the media, and contemporary art and culture in general. In the end, \"Picard\" has boldly gone where no literate fan of thought provoking scifi has gone or ever will go to.","rating":"1\/10","date":"5 March 2023"}
{"title":"Skip season 1 & 2 for real Star Trek","review":"The first two seasons are some B-movie version of Star Trek. You can skip them. But season 3 finally has the Star Trek feeling to it. The first two episodes were the first episodes of the whole show that actually felt like the good old Star Trek I'm used to.Though I'm not a fan of the dark style, it's reminding me of the first contact.Also the characters that are introduced are finally interesting and not annoying anymore. Captain Shaw is very interesting, the ferengi guy and the female captain of the alien ship are extremely well played and have some intriguing concepts.The 3rd season has the old moral and ethic dilemmas that Star Trek was famous for.The chemistry between the old tng crew is amazing and takes you right back to the old days.

{"title":"Good to see Picard in duress, but slow.","review":"I'm really enjoying seeing Picard go through a more angsty range of emotions than he typically showed in TNG (with episode exceptions, of course, but he popped right back up the next episode as though nothing had happened, as necessitated by TNG format.)I like the new characters, esp. Raffi and Rios (and his EXHs). Hopefully in season 2 the stick to their guns and don't rotate cast (frequencies) as they did in Discovery S2\/3. In comparison to 7 seasons worth of TNG, sure, they don't stand up, esp\nRios, but it's only been 7 episodes! If you keep pouring cast out every season, replacing with new, you'll never get there.Unfortunately the plot of this show moves along glacially for an hour-weekly. Cut down on the \"previously on\" and \"next time on\" and even the derivative title sequence, and expand the plot and characters a bit instead. I'd even take a bit more technobabble and starship glamour shots.","rating":"7\/10","date":"9 March 2020"}

And let's be honest with the whole 'violence' thing, it's a far cry from what we are used to in this day and age. Get with the time's people, I really think Trekky's or whatever you call them need to give there heads a shake.

{"title":"Data's Children","review":"Picard is about growing old and losing lhose around you. It is about regret. It is about second chances. It is a continuation of the final ST:TNG movie. Data has given his life to save Picard and Picard is lost because of it.\nAfter all this time 90 year old Picard (played by 80 year old Stewart), can not forgive himself for the death of his friend. When a young woman presents herself as Data's daughter, he feel he must do everything he can to protect Data's legacy.\nThe theme of loss and regret occur over and over in this handsomely produced production (See Ryker and Seven Of Nine). True Star Trek is based on the concept that the complexity of being human...compassion...hope...brotherhood...self-sacrifice...is what makes humanity noble. The nobility of humanity no matter what planet (or country) you are from is what Star Trek is all about. Star Trek: Picard fulfills that mission.","rating":"7\/10","date":"7 November 2020"}

I loved it then and love now that he finally succeeded beyond his dreams.However, I'm going to have to agree with the reviewers who don't like the cursing. I think it is unnecessary to have cursing. Star Trek never needed it to any great extent beyond the occasional \"hell\" or \"dammit.\" We don't need more than that now.I'm going to give the series a chance because I adore Sir Patrick and because I love that Data's daughter is the central character alongside Picard.Before anyone bashes my review...

{"title":"Picard is just not Picard","review":"As a fan of \"The Next Generation\", I was very excited when \"Picard\" was announced. The first season was weak, but I still had some hope for the series, as \"TNG\" also didn't have the best jumpstart, and \"Picard\" S02E01 got me optimistic.For an entire episode I was convinced it had found it's connection to the former series whilst opening it's own intriguing premise. What happened next was just insulting. What could have been an interesting, relatable and personal journey for it's leading character degraded into a generic soap opera loosely based on it's source material.In fact, the writing disrespects \"TNG\" to the point the main character is unrecognizable. The stoic, pragmatic, fierce Starfleet captain is not present in the series that bears his name.While it's a huge turn off for veteran Star Trek fans, one could argue that newcomers could still enjoy the show. I have bad news: as a series on it's own, \"Picard\" has no charisma, uniqueness, compelling characters, dazzling action... nothing. You never feel there's really anything important at stake. Actually, you don't even care.\"Let's make sure history never forgets the name...\". On that note, I must say Captain Jean Luc Picard's name is forever written in every trekker's heart. But what a sad swan song.","rating":"1\/10","date":"19 April 2022"}

Not the best characters? I can look through my fingers as long as there IS in fact a story line. Star Trek: Picard doesn't have one.The story line (if you can call it that) is virtually non existent. There is nothing cohesive about it all all. One second you are supposed to care about a character and feel like they may play a larger role only to have them disappear.Then your focus is changed to something else that's going on, then bam the next. It's like they are trying to fit five movies into one and it doesn't work leaving dead ends everywhere and characters that draw your attention that should have no time at all on screen.Overall, the story line is all over the place and doesn't make much sense. The characters are dull and have no real place. I surmise 90% of them are just there for needless drama.

{"title":"TNG meets Firefly meets Twilight","review":"Yes, Twilight. And for me that's what really ruins the show.The leading villains are two young adult Romulans who are highly placed in the Romulan most secret of all secret organizations. First of all, any villains from such organizations should always be older than, say, 35, and if they're not then they damn well better be geniuses. But these two are poorly written, poorly costumed, and poorly acted. There is nothing whatsoever about them that's not pedestrian.This show might have succeeded with better villains. As it stands, I'm stuck on episode 6 with no desire to watch any more. It's tedious. The only reason this gets 6 stars is because of Patrick Stewart. Santiago Cabrera is also fun, and there are two Romulan assistants to Picard who are engaging enough in the first few episodes.Other than that, everything about this show is juvenile, and not good juvenile, either. Twilight juvenile.","rating":"6\/10","date":"7 June 2020"}
{"title":"Star Trek is having a midlife crisis.","review":"Picard is continuing the tradition that virtually every show since Voyager ended has. It's having a midlife crisis where it's suddenly immensely insecure with its entire identity and has to get piercings, tattoos, a flashy car and act all badass.Welcome to Picard. Everyone involved in this show clearly feels and (and shows) that Picard and Star Trek are old and \"square\" and they need to be \"hip with the kids\" by making it all dark and gritty and making all the characters cool hipsters who don't let the Fed(eration) keep them down. They swear, they vape, there's numerous sex scenes, there's incest. In any other show I wouldn't care about these things but this is Star Trek, not Game of Thrones or Rome or Spartacus or some other show that would likely air on HBO or Showtime.Nothing in this show is Star Trek.The sets look ripped off from Star Wars or Blade Runner.Soji is basically ripped off from Summer Glau's Firefly character.Alison Pill is almost exactly her Newsroom character, just in space. Same \"quirky\" neurotic\/anxiety\/insecure and overshadowed character.Heck, they even had to plumb the depths of Voyager's plotlines for episode material and bring in Seven of Nine. Most Trekkers consider Voyager the worst of the 90s series so if Picard is having to dredge them for materials and characters what does that tell you?The sad thing is that Stewart is almost pointless in a show that he's supposed to be the frontrunner in, that carries his character's name. He does the bare minimum to get things moving but is mostly just a passive passenger to the plot. Gone are his epic speeches, his fire, his love for Starfleet and law and order. Now he's just a lame, quiet old man who lets people walk and talk all over him and around him while he does virtually nothing. No one is expecting the 80 year old Stewart to do action scenes but he's constantly on Broadway making himself heard and yet he can't even speak up for himself when being insulted to his face and mocked repeatedly in this series.","rating":"1\/10","date":"23 February 2020"}

The effect was less a man who was once Captain of a Starship and more an elderly man bemoaning the frailties of life.The storyline for Season 2 was good and I enjoyed how it all came together at the end.My biggest complaint though is the same with all of Star Trek, there is too much talking and very little interesting action.I ended up fast forwarding through most the later episodes in Season 2... particularly Picards ramblings and constant dwelling back to his Ch\u221a\u00a2teaux and mother (yawn!).It was good to see a cameo from Will Wheaton and I delighted in the return of the mighty Q6 out of 10 from me.","rating":"6\/10","date":"26 May 2022"}
{"title":"Fanboys need to shut up!!","review":"Here's an interesting fact for you......Look, at all the negative reviews for this show and note how many people show it is useful compared to not. If somebody rates the show as bad or awful, it's useful.Now look at all the positive reviews and note how many say it's useful........Funny how so many people are not willing to accept that people like myself, and others are loving this show, and say that their positive reviews are not useful.The fanboys who post they're negative reviews are living in the past and are not willing to accept that times have changed......and Star Trek is moving with them!!.There are some who post negative reviews, but at least give some constructive reasons as to why they dislike the show, and that's fine. That's the type of review that SHOULD be posted on this site, so any potential viewer can get properly balanced opinions.Unfortunately, there appears to be VERY few constructive negative reviews. The Fanboys who dislike this show just say \"This is not Star Trek\", or \"Star Trek is dead\", \"Boring\" etc, and quote past series as being better and the new series like Picard are dragging the Star Trek name in the dirt, and leave it at that.\nTheir 1 star ratings will have you believe that this show was made by complete amateurs, who are yet to get out of high school.Well, let me say this......this show DOES NOT deserve the vast number of negative reviews it has received.For those who haven't seen this show yet, it is vastly different from other Start Trek series you may have seen. I won't give any plot details away, but as the title suggests, this is about the much loved Picard, in retirement, doing what he does best, trying to solve a mystery and save the universe.\nAlong the way, he receives help from some old and familiar faces that we've come to know and love over the years.The first few episodes I must admit, are a little slow, and may put off some from continuing to watch. However, if you stick with it, the story becomes quite engaging.\nThe special effects are, as expected, top notch for a TV show, as is (in my opinion), the acting by all concerned.\nThe acting and production values are no where near as bad as some would have you believe.I do agree with some, that maybe this series could have been done with fewer episodes, and that the profanity used by some characters was unnecessary, which is why I have my 8 star rating.I, like many others, have grown up with Star Trek. I'm in my mid 50's and have enjoyed every incarnation of the franchise so far. There has never been anything particularly awful about any of them, (maybe one or two bad episodes in each series, but that's it).\nI also appreciate that Star Trek has to move with the times and appeal to a newer generation. Picard has made a big step in the right direction to achieve this, although Star Trek Discovery has done it better.\nIncidentally, the Star Trek fan boys slated that show too. Apparently, that show is so bad, it's now on it's third season......funny that!!.So, if you haven't seen this show yet, all I can say is make your own mind up by watching it yourself, and not believing the, quite frankly, unconstructive reviews, that would have you thinking this show was made by children.If, after seeing it, you dislike it, then post a review. But PLEASE, make it constructive so that we can all have properly balanced opinions.To the fanboys out there.....BOO HOO!!\nStar Trek is changing and evolving,. It needs to move on from the past you're living in, and it is in no way as bad as you're making it out to be.\nIt's not perfect by any means, I agree, but your one star reviews, in an effort to stop people watching the show are unnecessary.To the real fans who dislike the show, but are more reasonable with your criticisms, thank you. We need the good and the bad together, to give others who have not seen the newer Star Trek shows, proper, balanced reviews.P.S.I bet the fanboys are on this like a rash, rating my opinion as \"not useful\".","rating":"8\/10","date":"2 November 2020"}
{"title":"Mixed on the show","review":"While there are things I enjoy about the show. There are problems I have with the show. Killing of Hugh was not cool. Killing off the original Data again was not pleasing to see. I was not happy that Data's successor in Star Trek: Nemesis was made to be a failure.The f bombs and cussing are not appealing. The one torture scene was too graphic. The show is also very dark and deals with current politics.This show is not true to Star Trek vision of Gene Roddenberry and Rick Berman.","rating":"7\/10","date":"15 January 2022"}
{"title":"Not what Roddenberry envisioned..","review":"I'm all for creative freedom when taking an established universe with a large following and building on it with fresh new ideas. But if your going to change fundamental aspects of what was established then create an original.In general how did the Federation become such a dangerous place? Why are we straying so far away from Gene Roddenberry's vision of the future. Picard is saturated with personal conflict, toxicity, war, and everyone trying to blow stuff up. Yes those elements have always been a part of Star Trek but to a much lesser degree. Roddenberry's focus for the original Star Trek and every series that followed were on the positives of human evolution, character development, and forward thinking. Not dark chaos.Picard... most of the original characters from STNG and Star Fleet personnel in general, none of them reflect their original traits. Honor, integrity, self sacrifice, empathy, wisdom, trust, sound judgement, courage, ALL we're in abundance in STNG. In this series star fleet personnel are toxic, finger pointing, dismissive, rude, unforgiving, incompetent, constantly bickering goons with inferiority complexes. You don't need toxic crew interaction in every other scene to build tension. The crew spends more time trying to one up each other as opposed to working together and building comradery. No one seems to be able to offer a different opinion in a constructive way, it's either my way or mutiny! And can we dispense with the constant references to the original STNG crew as LEGENDS, seriously no one talks this way. Why can't any of them have a normal conversation???The one positive, the special effects are a PLUS! I have to admit, the effects, sound, uniforms, set designs, all are superior to other Sci-Fi productions. On TV. A small nitpick would be the ships designs (not a fan) but the bridge layouts and gadgets are pretty awesome. At least they got to at part right. For that it get 3 stars as opposed to 1.","rating":"3\/10","date":"4 March 2023"}

{"title":"Dismal","review":"I've been watching Star Trek since the 1980s, and I've always found something to enjoy and love about all of them - yes, that includes Voyager and the harshly-treated Enterprise. However, no matter how hard I try I cannot find anything to admire about Picard (and the equally execrable Discovery). Quite simply, they are not Star Trek as I know it, as it has been - successfully, I might add - for decades. The happiness and excitement I felt when this show was announced now feels like a cruel joke.All the previous series share common DNA, in both aesthetic and philosophy; a strong sense of positivity and righteousness, a faith that as long as you strive to do the right thing then all will turn out ok in the end. Those underpinning principles have been well and truly cast aside with Picard. It is grubby, ugly, nasty and very, very stupid. The writing is some of the poorest I've witnessed in a big-budget TV show for a long time, perhaps ever. The characters, if they can be called such, are so paper-thin that it takes several episodes to even remember their names. They are defined almost entirely by their many faults, and this is compounded by a stylised direction that allows no room for any meaningful relationship building or character development. They are essentially a bunch of cardboard cut-outs, thrown together into the emptiest-looking spaceship in the history of science fiction (seriously, it makes a Spartan house look like Liberace's boudoir) and hey presto! They're all friends now, for some reason.Between this and Discovery, it is apparent that CBS have zero interest in continuing to make Star Trek. They are instead making insipid, nonsensical, eye-achingly hideous shows in space for stupid people, and have draped them in the carcass of Star Trek in order to fool more people into watching them. I for one will be fooled no more.","rating":"3\/10","date":"16 April 2022"}
{"title":"Awesome! Just Awesome!","review":"This is a great start to the new series. I was skeptical at first about a show centered on Picard but the first episode put all my skepticism to rest.

The rest of the cast are great.\nYes, the story probably could have been told in fewer episodes, but that would be missing the point.

{"title":"Exceptional","review":"I was a massive fan of TNG so I awaited Picard with excitement. All 3 seasons surpassed my expectations! Seasons one and two are stand alone stories which also link over. I enjoyed then immensely! Old foes and new. Old friends mixed in with the fresh faces.Now, season three. It blew me away! I've never felt this range of emotion! The crew are back! Watch it! I've cried and smiled.Bloody fantastic!","rating":"10\/10","date":"24 January 2020"}
{"title":"Start with Season Three","review":"Each season stands alone, just like TNG tried to make each episodes stand alone, with few exceptions. Season two is miserable and season one isn't much better.If you're coming to the show to see what happened to the TNG crew, just start with Season Three. The season finale for Season Three is better than many of the movies and should keep you going.If you really really like it, then go one and two, and temper your expectations. There's a lot of dumb, interspersed with a few brilliant scenes. The pilot opener comes to mind, as well as a full episode of brilliance in season two before the writers threw away the brilliance brought by Brent Spiner.There's a lot of exposition throughout the series that gets quite annoying. How did Ro Laren go from stark enemy off the Federation to trusted confidant? Exposition. How did Dr. Crusher go from generic doctor to smuggler\/tactician? Exposition. Who is Raffi and why do we care? Exposition. So much more is just wished away via exposition.I wish Brent Spiner had been consulted earlier and granted creative authority in more sweeping fashion. His scenes managed to capture actual growth, and I can only imagine that happened as a function of his direct influence. I can only imagine how much better the series would've been had he been a producer or director.If this isn't your first Star Trek, start with TNG season 3, then DS9 from start to finish. You'll have enough opinion from there to fully explore the Star Trek universe.","rating":"6\/10","date":"25 April 2023"}
{"title":"What were they thinking?","review":"When I think of Star Trek, I think of a human race that was able to eliminate poverty, disease, hunger, and cruelty. Racism, sexism, and even money was a thing of the past. Humanity's drive became a philosophy of betterment and exploration. Then I watched the current Star Trek series, discovery and Picard and I think what the hell are the writters doing? The are totally trashing the whole concept of Star Trek. I mean how many people are getting killed in these series, and not just killed, the directors have to make sure we see the most violent gory killings that they can get away with. I mean in Piccard the scene with the eyeball is just yuk, they turned Star Trek into a gore fest with F-bombs and blood flying in every direction. Would you ever let your child watch this version of Star Trek? Absolute trash, the current lot of writers are so bad at writing they cannot captivate and audience with a storyline so they use blood, sex, cussing, gore and cgi to make up for their writing deficiencies.Give both these trash series a wide berth, and just rewatch the old classic Star Trek.","rating":"1\/10","date":"29 April 2022"}

{"title":"Mesmerisingly bad. An insult to Trek fans.","review":"Where to begin. I feel sorry for Patrick Stewart. I'm sure when the makers of this show approached him, this diabolical mess wasn't what he had in mind. I won't mention the lame wokeism as I think that has been appropriately covered in other reviews. Not a single hint of what made Picard's original character great can be seen in this show. It almost feels like the show isn't really even about him. They've shoehorned a completely unnecessary backstory about his childhood in there as an obvious attempt to give the character new depth, but it just doesn't really work. It just adds to the increasing distance you feel from the character. The dialogue is absolutely woeful. Each scene just feels like you're waiting for the next witty quip. The plot just seems to stagnate around a few themes without really moving forward. Episodes 5 and 6 in series 2 end with basically the same cliffhanger. They use \"sci-fi\" technology to brush past absurdly convenient events that seem to only happen so the characters can find something or go somewhere. As others have alluded to, the writing is just absolutely terrible. If you're a Trek fan, my sincere advice would be to not watch it. The only reason I'm persevering is because the finale of series 1 was okay and series 3 sounds moderately promising in terms of its cast.","rating":"1\/10","date":"25 April 2022"}

{"title":"Review only for season 3","review":"This rating does not apply to season 1 and 2, in fact those deserve bellow 1 star for the poor quality of the story and character development, but that is besides the point.So far, Season 3 is more or less mediocre in style, and I do not keep the writers\/director at fault for this as I know there are studio challenges and contracts that must be respected.If this seasons would have been the first in its arc, I would have been more permissive with the score, as most Trek Series (prior to 2010) had accommodating beginnings and then started getting better witch each new season.More to the point: This season induces a lot of good memories to the previous seasons and legendary characters, but most of those are just references. The majority of the cast they brought back is still in good acting condition (with the exception of picard.. damn, the years haven't been kind to his looks and acting).The story is interesting but so far a bit predictable and it feels like there are a lot of restrictions to dialog lines somewhat (they still throw sears and talk a bit to casual for a star fleet that should live in a complex civilized future that should be way more mature than our current times). Don't get me wrong, Picard S3 is lightyears ahead of S1 and 2, but a few lightdecades in style behind all the good Treks we are used to.To be honest I do not even know why they named the show Picard since he (the former captain) mostly just drags along side the show and everyone else takes most of the spotlight. I do see a potential series with his son Jack Crusher, but the harsh reality is that fans are tired of being hyped about new series when we have no idea what unprofessional director they bring behind them and just make all new atrocities over and over as we have been proven time and time again.Before, we never expected bad performances or a bad story and character developments to such magnitude, because there have always been competent writers and studios in the older treks, but today the Trek world is just a \"platform\" for these extreme people that wish to promote various messages that they \"believe\" everyone should accept (they are the true borg).All I can say is this: we have been lucky to get this Season 3 to be somewhat decent, but I have little hope for this getting better in future series or even repeating this standard level.A 6\/10 is a gentle pat on the back, but this is far from being satisfactory, since previous Treks (prior to 2010) proved they could go way beyond our expectations and really surprise us with amazing feelings that rarely required constant action to keep us interested!","rating":"6\/10","date":"8 March 2023"}
{"title":"First season was just ok but the second started strong","review":"I always liked Star Trek, when I was a kid I imagined this is the future will look like. The Next Generation is still my favourite Star Trek tv show and I was excited when this show was announced. I had my doubts but I stayed open minded. First season was ok but I think if compressed to 2-3 hours would be much better. When it ended I was like \"yeah, nice sentiment, few known characters appeared for a moment, I pretty sure I'll forget about in tomorrow\". But then second season came out (at the time of the review there was only one episode available). I'm not going to spoil anything so I will just write that my favourite secondary character made an appearance (plus some unexpected nemesis ;) ) and it looks like the second season will be much better. I hope they won't ruin it.Edit: after watching second episodeWOW! It was mad! As I said, I don't want to spoil anything, so I will just say that this is what I liked about Star Trek The Next Generation - the unexpected, the weirdness no one can explain, trying to figure out the good and the bad guys.

Worthwhile drama with familiar characters...\nUpdating this review.The third season has devolved into the Easter egg show. Where's the story?

{"title":"It's still not the Star Trek fans expect","review":"The show is largely using nostalgia. Some actors from the old shows reappeared either for a brief role, the other - as secondary characters. It was a great opportunity to answer old questions and actually make a continuation, not a reboot or alternative timeline, as it's unpleasantly popular nowadays.Yet the slow pace is borderline boring, and the story is just not believable, being mostly independent from the wast past lore. It is also fairly narrow, such that in a big picture of the Star Trek universe it's completely insignificant. That's where the viewer sees that it's just a spin-off of little significance and not an attempt to take over the legacy and develop it further.There are no big mistakes, but no achievements either. And let's be honest, if not for the fact it's THE Picard in Star Trek universe, the rating with such writing and story would be lower than it is.Hardcore trekkies will probably like it. Sci Fi fans will find it ok. Casual viewer might be disinterested, though.","rating":"7\/10","date":"7 March 2022"}

{"title":"Dark Trek","review":"Despite never being a big TNG fan, this series (especially season 1) is engrossing and a very good addition to the Star Trek pantheon.The problem however is the same issue many shows have now. It's too dark! Unless you plan to watch this after 8pm or in a windowless room, it makes it difficult to enjoy in the daytime. It's very hard to get into a show when you can't see half of what is going on screen.The other issue is the over reliance on Brent Spiner and the \"Data\" problem. Having him in the show so much feels like a force fed scenario. Kill him off in one incarnation, bring him as another character and repeat over and over. It becomes very distracting as you feel It halts the shows development of characters not played by Spiner or Stewart.Originally a 9\/10 but after season 2 8\/10.","rating":"6\/10","date":"11 May 2022"}
{"title":"Not what I'd hoped.","review":"Star Trek Picard feels like a sort of fan fiction written enthusiastically by children that grew up loving Star Trek without actually understanding what it was all about or what made it great. In that, I'm not speaking of social issues, which of course have always been a corner stone to the Star Trek universe (I've been seeing that as an awkward counterpoint to many notes of criticism), but rather a depth of story and breadth of imagination born of developed and mature characters and narratives that provoked thought and expanded perspective. I started watching Star Trek Picard expecting\/hoping for a new story with that same (or perhaps even greater) degree of thoughtfulness and sophistication, featuring the 90s character representative of the pinnacle of that thoughtfulness and intelligence, Picard himself. What I got instead was a rag-tag crew of misfits (Picard included) racing their way through a tumultuous plot progression of fan-pleasing reference points and half-witted dialogue written, apparently, with no more thought or artistry than what was absolutely necessary to create the next drab bridge point in plot; A plot ripe with fan favourite references and surface level social commentary, but utterly absent in depth, development, or inspiration.Perhaps I can't speak for all Star Trek fans. Perhaps I can't even speak for most. But, for my own part, the thing that stings most about this new era of Star Trek isn't the social commentary that everyone's been obsessing over; It isn't the hyper-stylized lens-flare, or the new uniforms; It's not even the casting or the ship design or the countless threats to continuity. The thing that stings most is that while I've gotten 30+ years older since I first fell in love with this expansive and dynamic sci-fi franchise, gaining wisdom and experience all the way, Star Trek has, at best, reverted. While I've gotten older and more discerning, Star Trek has gotten younger and more child-like. Softer, and less sophisticated. It's become... puerile. And I hate that. I hate the implication. That Star Trek fans somehow don't need depth. That we don't need sophistication. That the original Star Trek was \"silly\" and so it should all be \"silly\" and needn't be more than that. That we should all somehow be satisfied with... comic book fan fiction. Perhaps that's the idea. Perhaps Star Trek today is for a different audience. My children, rather than myself. But when I was a boy watching that big, beautiful ship drift out of space dock, it wasn't just for me at all... it was for everyone. My parents, my grandparents, my friends. Star Trek's lost that. At least as far as I'm concerned. And that's sad.","rating":"1\/10","date":"26 March 2022"}

{"title":"Season 3","review":"So... this won't be a review just a few thoughts.As of now Season 3 seems to be the best of the New Star Trek shows, there are still problems but this is watchable.The Star fleet personnel acts like disgruntled employees on some cruise ship and it makes me feel like I am watching something other that Star Trek.To this feeling also contributes the way Vulcans act in this series, the one on the bridge act's like she's pooping her pants and the one in EP4 (in Picard's memory) like a shy 10 year old girl.As mentioned above, there are other issues as well.In closing I want to mention that this is progress and I don't want to take away from that, it's just that we are not there yet.","rating":"6\/10","date":"10 March 2023"}

{"title":"One of the Best Star Trek Productions ever","review":"Patrick Stewart aka Jean Luc Picard was the best Captain ever. The Original James Tiberon Kirk played by WS in comparison was a simple brute.TNG gave Star Trek the intellectual density back that GR originally intended. See also later non Star Trek related later works of him (Andromeda, Earth - The Final conflict).The other later Star Trek Commanders like Benjamin Sikso and Kathreen Janeway are also far better than the original Captain Kirk, but both do not rise to Jean Luc Picard.I personally have the feeling - while I cannot prove it - that Patrick Stewart really identified himself with his role. And since he was via TNG the most successful Captain for Paramount - he was given the previledge to modify Jean Luc Picard in the TNG series. And so the real Jean Luc Picard was born, which is clearly visible in the later TNG series.A man with a deep personal history (Chateau, Family, Wine Maker) who was raised with the objective to open his eyes and to keep this eyes forever open, and the utmost importance to become and to stay a responsible person.His determination to fulfill his obligations is also visible in the later Star Trek cinema films, in which Jean Luc Picard appears.Now the series PICARD tries to relate to this great history. And I have to say in this regard, PICARD is far better than Discovery, although I have to concede that the Commander that for the first time resembled this deep personal history and this felt true conception of someone taking really responsibility is Micheal Burnham in DISCOVERY.So I have to admit that I like both.My personal order of Star Trek Favorites is thus modified:1. TNG\n2. PIC\n3. DSC\n4. VOY\n5. DS9\n6. TOS\n7. ENT.","rating":"10\/10","date":"31 March 2022"}
{"title":"If you don't get it the first time rewatch it and see what happens","review":"Ok so I know the fan base are not thrilled about Picard. I have been a committed fan of TNG and Especially DS9. I liked VOY and hated ENT. Picard when I first watched didn't grab me initially in the way I expected or wanted. I found it lacking certain elements that I had come to expect from Trek. I have to admit I was wrong. I recently found myself with time on my hands and binged watched the whole show again. This time I watched without my preconceived ideas and expectations and I Loved it. It moved me in a way that it hadn't before. Star Trek has a lot to answer for with the Abrams reboots and the dire directions those film have gone. I wasn't overly thrilled with Shinzon in Star Trek Plotholes either but Picard has purpose and a direction I'm excited about. Rumours are Guinan and possibly Sisko may appear in season 2 and I for one can't wait","rating":"8\/10","date":"9 February 2021"}

{"title":"A Return to Picard's Most Compelling Story, Somewhat Mishandled","review":"If you enjoy \"Next Generation,\" like me, then you're probably happy about the new show, \"Picard,\" but there are some significant stylistic differences between this and the older show which have strengths and weaknesses.In contrast to \"The Next Generation,\" the first season of \"Picard\" is pretty much all business with its single overarching plot line that spans the entire first 10 episodes, a continuation of what happened at the end of \"The Next Generation\" and gone are the lighter standalone and two or three part stories found in the earlier seasons of the earlier show. In fact, \"Picard\" lacks that lightheartedness which was such an important part of \"The Next Generation's\" draw, instead diving straight into the heaviest story available. The story used for the first season of \"Picard\" is a continuation of the most serious story from Picard's past. It does make the most convincing case for the return of Picard from retirement and back onto your screen, but if you were ready, by the end of \"Next Generation,\" to move on from that story and see something else, then the first season of \"Picard\" might well seem a little grueling to sit through.That said, as someone who was indeed ready to see what happened in the last season of \"The Next Generation\" become a smaller detail about Picard, I have to admit that, generally speaking, the creative team behind \"Picard\" did a pretty good job with it. So, it was less grueling than I anticipated even though I did wish to move on already and maybe even have the occasional fun little short story arch like on the older show.Notwithstanding, to me, the first season of \"Picard\" started out much more compelling than it ended and I feel that I have to acknowledge that although \"Picard's\" writers took on the most convincing case for Picard's return, they ultimately didn't make it into the best story. Maybe I felt that way because the story which they continued from the end of \"The Next Generation\" was one of my least favorite stories from that show, albeit the most serious, but I also think that \"Picard's\" supporting characters were sometimes much weaker than those on \"The Next Generation\" and the reason for that could be that instead of doing shorter, more playful plots that allow us to learn about and bond with the characters, \"Picard's\" first season took a path that left no time for anything of that style.","rating":"7\/10","date":"4 April 2021"}

{"title":"3 things I love and hate about season 1:","review":"Love:\nWe get a look into the future of the original timeline(I had waited nearly 20 years for this.) Since it's a more compact and focused show, nearly all of the universe remains unexplored. However, bits and pieces are sprinkled about containing callbacks and lore that will speak to the nerdiest of Star Trek fans.Hate:\nThe universe is presented in a dumbed down and modern Hollywood sort of way. I don't mind that it's rated mature, but the maturity of the writing makes it seem less mature. You don't need to kill off important characters to capture the hearts of the audience. In fact, meaningless deaths do the complete opposite of that. Space fights sometimes capture the essence of tension, but lose it by the finale. Especially when it makes sense, sometimes less is more.Love:\nMost of the acting from the main cast and even extended cast is very well done. Picard himself is of course phenomenal, as are the TNG cameos. Even his bridge crew is very well assembled and complimentary. In the first half of the season, the time is taken to establish all key players. You can tell time went into casting and it shows.Hate:\nI can understand that a limited run of 10 episodes held back character development half way through, but you have to take that into consideration when that is what you have to work with. Craft a narrative that works within what you're trying to achieve and make sure to give your characters time to justify the actions they take, instead of just moving on to the next plot thread.Love:\nScenes with Data, Riker, and Troi are written with the utmost care. The magic returns, and we are swept up(briefly) in a glorious parallel universe where Rick Berman-led Trek continued for another 18 years. I know(Berman has his faults,) but he mostly carried on the Roddenberry legacy, and brought a quality and budget to Star Trek that hadn't been seen before. The season ends in a promising way, in that it's like we're ready to boldly explore the galaxy like a proper Star Trek series.Hate: The show proper and central plot never reaches the heights of the original cast cameos. In actuality it looks worse for it, especially when the all the time needed is taken to develop these scenes. I can assure you that the same care and time management wasn't applied to most of the main plot (and side stories with new cast members.) Sloppy writing aside, nearly every opportunity to capitalize on a resonant moment was skipped over because we had to rush on to the next thing that was happening. I'm hoping they adopt a more closed episode(bottle episode) format for season 2, so that future storylines are easier to manage(with maybe just a single, more focused season long arc.)-BONUS-\nWinners:\nJean-Luc.\nWill.\nData.\nElnor.\nRios(and his holograms.)\nDahj.\nZhaban and Laris(farmers.)\nRiker's daughter.\nThe title intro and score.\nThe advertising holograms in episode 5.Middling:\nRaffi.\nAgnes.\nTroi.\nNarissa.\nLa Sirena(Rios' ship.)Losers:\nSoji.\nHugh.\nSeven.\nNarek.\nMaddox.\nSoong.\nThat crazy lady who yelled about the destroyer.\nThe rest of Starfleet.\nThe rest of the Romulans.\nThe rest of the Borg.\nThe rest of the Androids.Nitpick of the season:\nStarfleet vessels apparently don't deploy the armor technology that Janeway brought back from the future at the end of Voyager..","rating":"7\/10","date":"27 March 2020"}

{"title":"A start so impressive it met high expectations","review":"Chronologically we havent had any \"new\" trek since Voyager ended\/Nemisis in 2001\/2002. Since then it's been prequels and reboots.So Picard headlining the first new Trek in near 20 years had fans like me filling the proverbial cup...but this also set a ridiculously high bar to meet.Everything in Ep1 met high that bar and in many places surpassed it. The look, the feel, the story and most importantly the characters.It genuinely feels like 20 years has passed for the captain...even if Patrick Stewart appears to age more slowly than any other more mortal.The tie ins to the events of both the JJ'verse and Nemesis were handled extremely well; and the closing scene left me feeling like it was 20 years ago.It might only be one episode in; but as my friend said \"we're back baby\".","rating":"","date":"25 January 2020"}
{"title":"Not surprised to see the negative reviews - I think preconceived ideas may be a factor here.","review":"There are quite a number of negative reviews aren't there?! Of course everyone has an opinion and they're entitled to it :)I'll start by saying that I hated Discovery. I had to let it go after a few episodes. I readily admit that maybe it happened because I went in with my expectations too high. They certainly were high. But there was so much to dislike there between terrible acting and boring plots and unlikeable characters.I went into Star Trek: Picard with a very open mind. I told myself beforehand - \"this is NOT going to be my beloved TNG\" and simply to leave that notion behind.I'm glad I did. Yes it's certainly not TNG, but I think Stewart has stepped back into one of his most famous roles with grace and aplomb. Picard's life has changed but that warmth that we saw in him (first season excluded!) is well and truly there. I'm three episodes in and they're just heading in to space and I'm glad this point has come. I know they had to set the tone, do the exposition and establish new characters. I've enjoyed it up to now and have every reason to believe I will enjoy the rest. (I must say that hearing a Romulan with a VERY Irish accent takes me out of those scenes - and I'm Irish! It just hits the ear strangely. Do not get me started on Santiago Cabrera's attempt at an Irish accent! Just no.)Patrick Stewart has been very vocal about wanting to do justice to the work that he is so proud of in TNG and not diminish it. With an executive producer credit I have faith that all will be well and we'll get something different here but rooted in that 24th century world we know and love.***Possible spoiler*** Some reviewers are complaining that Starfleet is a shambles and is not the Starfleet they know. Of course it's not... It has been infiltrated and is an actual plot point. Give things a chance! ***Spoiler ends***I'm sticking around for this ride!","rating":"7\/10","date":"7 February 2020"}

Most seem to hate it and people that I trust told me to stay far away, but being a bit bored I decided to give it a go... and oh boy... oh boy... this was even worse than I thought.This is the desecration of Picard's legacy turning a heroic captain and very smart man into a blabbering fool barely able to sit down on a toilet and outsmarted in every turn. Picard is constantly told what to do, he is constantly apologising for existing and every token diversity hire is smarter, faster, stronger, and better than he is.This is the TV show you write and make if you hate a character. I mean really, truly hate him. The writers, directors and all the actors are in this show to dig a grave for Picard, and then spit on it.Absolute disgraceful and one of the worst things I have ever seen...

{"title":"15 years a fan of this series.","review":"Take my advice and don't try to look at this as a continuation from TNG,DS9 or any other adaptation of the Star Trek series.There are too many people on here who make retrospective comments regarding similarities in past generations of the franchise and it's as if nothing the cast ever does will please those who want to old 'less conflict more resolution' series back.It's crazy to think that after years of reruns and not seeing the cast in anything really successful that most of you guys would hate on this franchise like it just insulted a family member or something, take the lesser reviews with a pinch of salt and remind yourself that half the people here are probably die hard fans that would probably send death threats if god forbid they changed something.My review of this series was it was a breath of fresh air, the new discovery series wasn't as well received and it was as if they were trying to modernise the franchise to bring younger fans on board however this one.. it's just different.The cast are likeable, the use of cgi is amazing, the bad guys are typically hatable with a charm and the story in my opinion is well received.I adored seeing the old cast mix with the new and the ending was phenomenal too!

{"title":"A shell of a man...","review":"The good of the show: Visually stunning, great CGI, nice worlds. Somewhat compelling if it was anything other than trying to fit itself into the Star Trek Universe. It largely starts off looking and feeling like Blade Runner, morphs into Firefly, and then ends in a way that hints at Cylons. Which in and of itself isn't bad, if only it weren't called Star Trek.And that largely is the problem... It's is not Star Trek. It says it's Star Trek, and it has characters from Star Trek, and there are lots of Star Trek references, but it isn't really Star Trek.As a sci-fi story, the concept isn't terribly bad, however I get the sense that the writers had a story in mind but for whatever reasons they didn't feel that it was strong enough to stand on it's own. Perhaps the studios felt that they couldn't compete with The Expanse, and so they decided to turn the story into a Star Trek franchise much like they did with Star Trek Tardigrades, I mean... Discovery.The problem is that Picard spends most of his time apologizing and being criticized for simply for existing and everyone else on the ship is suffering and coping with existential issues. Space Elf is really the only one who just seems to be happy and content being Space Elf with a sword, hacking bad guys left and right, while 7 of 9 is the strangest addition to this motley crew simply because her story is more of a macguffin than anything, and doesn't actually add anything to the narrative.... And they kill Data... again... because Butterflies that don't die aren't Butterflies?There is so much wrong with this series it's almost easier to talk about what's right. The Borg Cube was cool, Alton Inigo Soong was a solid addition, and Riker and Troi's part was actually kind of nice.Some would say that Star Trek needs to evolve, which is true, however in all things there is a spirt and a substance and an essence that culminates in the whole. To be sure, the substance of Star Trek is there, however it lacks the spirit and essence of Star Trek. There is something profoundly odd about today's current generation that says so long as you put on the suit, you can identify yourself as being a part of that which the suit represents. Typically, this is considered to be stolen valor, and frowned upon in most of the world.... And they fixed the ship with a sonic screwdriver where all they had to do was use their imagination......How people are liking this series and getting excited over \"Star Trek\" is back is beyond me. It's really for the cos-players and fandoms who like the idea of Star Trek because of how it makes them feel like they are part of a community. But in a world where Klingons are now Orcs, canon means nothing, and it's more about representation rather than story, you could pretty much slap a label on whatever you want and call it Star Trek, and it would be so.","rating":"1\/10","date":"10 July 2020"}

{"title":"Total dishonour to the Star Trek franchise","review":"Clickbait millennial woke garbage that dishonours the memory of Picard and the Star Trek franchise. Another train wreck from Alex Kurtzman.I was watching it with low expectations after the first episode. Kind of like a B series you have in the background or something to pass the time. That is until I reached episode 5, stardust city rag.Spoiler alert - I was really pleased to see a cameo from a certain voyager former Borg lady, that is until Alex literally butchered Echep - her surrogate son. The way he directed it actually made me angry. It was unjustifiably violent and disgusting the way they graphically ripped him apart. It dishonoured and disrespected the whole memory of voyager which was a fun and enjoyable journey. All for clickbait and \"likes\" and \"impact\".I was so put off I stopped watching after that episode. The series lost my respect entirely.I then googled to see if anyone was as annoyed as I was by the disrespect. Indeed there were many, to the extent a director addressed it in an interview. His excuses were \"we did not have much time to explain the back story with seven, so we had to find a way to make her story and hardship as impactful as possible\". Basically he is saying they butchered Echep to save time on explaining a back story or to gain any depth of sevens appearance or backstory since voyager. A real unclassy cheap and disrespectful move. If you weren't happy with the time you had, you shouldn't have done anything. Or you should have left it hollow, as you have done with the rest of your show.The other point he made is \"violence is art\". This is utterly deluded. Gratuitous violence for likes is not art. It's violence for likes, and it is unacceptable to try and justify it to the consumers.Patrick Steward is elderly. I can understand him getting tricked into acting in this show because he likely thinks he is being \"current\" and appealing to a new generation. However, I am genuinely surprised any Star Trek hero would sign off on this embarrassment of a show, especially with the dishonour they have wrought upon the Star Trek universe.Aside form this, the plot is predictable, the characters soulless, dislikeable and gormless, and it is a total waste of space. I am glad I had the foresight to pull out when I did as I cannot see it getting any better.Alex Kurtzman, you should seriously consider retiring from directing Star Trek. Please stop butchering a loved franchise. The original Star Trek fans are not impressed.","rating":"1\/10","date":"24 July 2022"}

The first couple of season were OK but the third season of Picard is different in a much better way. It brings the entire TNG back together in the most fun way and some of the utopian nativity has been soften with realism. The old crew is back, the old ship is back, the Borg is back and even the fun dynamics between the characters has been successfully restored.

The rest of the TNG cast is also written as perfectly as they could be. Not only are they written well, but all the actors are incredible! New characters introduced are instant favorites and I hope to see more of them.The overall story was engaging and well written. It was a dumpster fire such as Season 1 and 2. The ending of every episode left me on the edge of my seat wanting more.Everything about the third season is an unbelievable improvement: Production design, costumes, music, visual effects, makeup, etc.Season 3 improves and fixes everything the TNG movies and first two seasons of Picard destroyed.

I was so much looking forward to this.Bringing back Jonathan Frakes, Marina Sirtis, Brent Spiner and Jeri Ryan was so thrilling.The First season showed potential although Dr. Jurati murders her scientist collaborator and lover Dr. Maddox and her action bared no consequence. Oh, it's alright, she was under the spell of a Romulan cult demonizing Androids. I guess murder has now become legal in this future as she remained part of the crew. Aside from this and a few other incoherencies, I say it again, it had potential.The second season is a disaster and an insult to intelligence. Apart from a few enjoyable moments like the time travel and the loud music in the bus, winks of The Voyage Home, the whole storyline is UNBEARABLE.If they wanted to fix the many flaws of Nemesis, they've succeded.

{"title":"Sir Pat brings his A game","review":"Sir Patrick Stewart has always been a great actor and at times was allowed to let this shine in TNG. But since then he has matured in both appearance and talent and Picard brings it all. Picard is more human now, less... Starfleet.The show enjoys a wonderful arc which is still playing out with some standout performances. Especially from Santiago Cabrera who I can see going on to be a fan favourite in his roll as Captain Rios... and the EMH... and the ENC.... and the emergency everything else.With subtle nods to the rest of the Trek universe which is done in a way which doesnt seem cheesy or like they just shoehorned it in there to tick a box. The music cues too are just a delight.And when you see Riker and he gives Enterprise commands like \"Shields up, sensors to maximum\" its just the band back together pure Blues Brothers style.If you've been craving to find out how Jean Luc continued his adventures or to see how Starfleet is really then this show is for you.Why only 9? The early episodes seemed like they were shot by someone who had just got out of film school. The camera movement was un-necessary and jarring, some of the pacing was off. This improved dramatically when J.Frakes took over and then a new one since then who is also an improvement.","rating":"","date":"11 March 2020"}

{"title":"Blue skies","review":"When the Berlin Wall came down in 1989, I experienced as a teenager that even bitter conflicts such as the Cold War can be overcome. Everything seemed to be solvable with diplomacy and clever people who have learned from history. At that time I watched the utopian series STAR TREK: THE NEXT GENERATION full of optimism. In a world without money or greed, the people there were able to make the world better, no matter wheather they are researchers or artists. Existing adversity could be overcome with humanism and technical progress. In reality, this pacifist utopia was over a few years later, and the ongoing Star Trek series reacted to this: in DEEP SPACE NINE it was no longer so certain who the good and bad are in the warlike game of politics, In the STAR TREK: ENTERPRISE series (from 2001), Captain Archer even makes completely irrational decisions that are out of proportion. If clever science fiction reflects reality, Star Trek has often succeeded and that explains the charm of this rich fandom. STAR TREK: PICARD takes up this approach. A resigned old Jean Luc Picard still believes in ideals 20 years ago in a time when all ideals were thrown overboard for political reasons. He doesn't have to save the entire universe or fight against overpowering opponents who, like in STAR TREK: DISCOVERY, want to erase the world. He stands for something and reminds us that it is basically each of us who can work together with others. This optimism is just the right thing to face the seemingly hopeless today. The very first episode of STAR TREK: PICARD is exceptionally good and the best Star Trek in decades. I am very happy what Sir Patrick and Pulitzer Prize winner Michael Chabon, among others, have achieved here. Engage!","rating":"10\/10","date":"24 January 2020"}

A tragic waste of the brilliant Next Gen series and undermines the very core of Star Trek as a hopeful look of what humanity could be. Continues the truly awful tradition CBS has started with turning a franchise about humanities progress, hope, and unity, into a mess of current day issues.

It is kind of what i hoped discovery would be.In a way it has the pure essence of Star Trek and it is in the same way very modern. The kind of Star Trek i always hoped id get. Not some unlogical JJ-esque Star Trek 2009 or Discovery were the plot is just built to convenience, stitching Action pieces together and show off coll stuff (like the BS with the Starflett Delta drawn in the Sand in the Pilot of Discovery).It feels very grounded, i see why people are refering it has some Expanse in it, and feels good. It is totaly believable. I love seeing Patrick Stewart again and all the connections to TNG. It harkens back to loved Episodes like Familiy, Measure of a Man, all good things, Insurection, and the Offspring. It is finally the continuation of the Star Trek i grew up with. I almost cried in some scense with data.Even for my Girlfriend it is perfect to watch. For her it modern storytelling nothing cheesy, for me it is TNG, DS9 finally grown up (Enterprise felt kind of cheesy, 90s cliches in the 2000s).Offcourse the production values are superb. It certainly was not cheap.","rating":"7\/10","date":"25 January 2020"}

You wouldn't give the same gift to your partner year after year and expect them to like it. So it only makes sense that that these 'spin offs' and movies and a different tone to keep up with the times. This is Star Trek for 'the next generation' (get it). If they repackaged the same old Star Trek with a shiny new coat of paint, these same people will still complain saying it's 'too samey'. This is brilliant TV so far. It's held my attention which little shows do now a days. Two thumbs up from me.","rating":"","date":"13 February 2020"}

Several critics feel that this is not Star Trek, and that might be true, I don't feel I'm experiened enough to make a judgement like that. So I've been watching it as a standalone show that does bring in things from the past but not enough for you as a viewer to miss out.The story is a bit slow starting but I don't mind. I get sci-fi and a great story and I feel entertained. That's why I keep watching.","rating":"7\/10","date":"7 March 2020"}
{"title":"\"Next Generation\" is back!!!!","review":"Most people would agree that \"The Next Generation\" is still one of the best \"Star Trek\" series. This is kind of a sequel of sorts. After TNG ended, the cast moved to the big screen for four theatrical films. There were plans for a 5th & final TNG film that would also feature characters from DS9 & VOY. Due to the box office bomb that was \"Nemesis,\" that never happened. 18 years later, TNG returns in the form of \"Star Trek: Picard,\" a 10-part serial telling one grand story. We follow an old retired man going back out into space to find and rescue the twin-sister of the woman he failed to help in the opening episode. Along the way are familiar TNG characters, Seven from Voyager, Romulans, the Borg, androids, and new characters. Starfleet sees Picard as an old, retired, and stuck in the past. He asks for a ship, and they tell him to go home. This is Picard, guys. Does he take no for an answer? Naturally, he hires a private ship and a small crew. He's not out to save the galaxy, he's out to rescue one woman. A small ship and crew will get the job done. Along the way, it becomes oh so much more than that, he's old, possibly fatally ill, and in over his head with few resources and no help from Starfleet. This show is incredibly awesome. It honestly feels like a movie stretched out into a 10-part serial.There is some cussing, smoking, drinking, and some \"loser\" characters that the audience and reviewers here on IMDB object to. That's part of the charm. Picard isn't on the Enterprise with Starfleet's finest. In the season finale, his age is given as 96, I think. This is an old man who no one takes seriously anymore. He hires a Captain with a little cargo ship and a crew of \"nothing better to do\" misfits and out into space they go. I really like this theme. All of the characters grow due to the nurturing of Picard leading to a very emotional finale.This show didn't ruin Star Trek. This is still the bright happy future of TNG. However, the show is about an old man legend and the misfits who fall through the cracks of society.Give the show 3 episodes to find it's footing. It's in the third episode that everyone is gathered together that you see where the rest of the season is going.","rating":"10\/10","date":"14 June 2021"}
{"title":"Disappointing even with the nostalgia","review":"Season 1 follows retired Admiral Picard who gets drawn into a conspiracy regarding the Romulans and a Borg cube.It's an absolute pleasure to see Picard again after so long but the plot is a real slow burn and there is far too much filler dialogue. As ever, writers love to stretch a story over 10 episodes when it needs far less. Apart from the speed, the plot is fine.The style is darker than TNG which is good, but it also tries to be emotive but largely fails due to superficial character development.Overall, not bad. There are some wonderful moments but they just needed to squeeze it into less episodes. Some of the nostalgia carries this series, so TNG fans will enjoy. I did not like the ending.I then just finished Season 2. It was incredibly disappointing. Oftentimes dull, oftentimes ridiculous. A stupid plot encompassing alternative reality and time travel.I loved Star Trek TNG but even for nostalgia reasons this just doesn't cut it.I would not recommend this Season even for fans. Season 2 is worse than Season 1.","rating":"6\/10","date":"5 January 2022"}

So glad that it has been renewed since season 3. Been a Star Trek fan for over thirty years.\nHere is what I don't like. I grew-up as a star trek fan since I was like ten-ish. It's why I went into science. Why do you need to use the F word in Star Trek Picard and Discovery??? I don't really care. But, my parents and I know a lot of parents won't allow children to watch a show with that word in it. Why not expose more children to Star Trek. Just leave that word out. It won't take away from the show at all.","rating":"10\/10","date":"11 March 2020"}
{"title":"Season 3 - Star Trek nostalgia with lens flares","review":"This is a review of Star Trek Picard Season 3 only not the previous 2 seasons, because let's face it Season 1 & 2 are not Star Trek so I just gracefully ignore them and pretend they never happened (same as Season 3 at times does too - and that is good)!I am a huge Trekkie and I never thought I'd feel good watching Star Trek again, certainly not since Secret Hideout took helm of this now broken franchise. Previously I watched few episodes of STD and opening episodes of Picard Season 1 & 2, but couldn't stand watching more than few episodes, so when I came across Picard S3 as part of the Prime deal, I was very skeptical to begin with but based on positive reviews decided to give it a go.To my huge surprise, after a so-so start I could not only bare to watch, but actually liked it - something I haven't experienced with Trek for a very long time and it felt fantastic!Yes the Picard Season 3 is still confined to that awful, dark, depressing-lens flare filled universe we saw in all previous Secret Hideout \"Star Trek\" projects, but the new show runner manages to pull a rabbit out of the hat with this one and despite the confines of the requirements form production company, manages to deliver a very enjoyable show, with very decent new and old characters that above everything make you feel good and long for more!If this was a separate project that could fully let go of all the previous \"New Trek\" garbage like swearing, F-bombs and go easier on stuff that doesn't excessively belong to real Trek like drugs, unnecessary graphical violence and get visually closer say The Orville (which is great btw and in many ways spiritual successor to ST), I would stay this would have been a fantastic Star Trek show better than even some of the older Trek projects and recent movies!Despite all the drawbacks, I have to be honest in saying Season 3 managed to make me feel excited as a Star Trek fan again and not just because of the member-berries and ever present fan service, but because it captured the spirit of the old Trek and I finally felt that a normal Star Trek show, while very unlikely is still possible.","rating":"7\/10","date":"4 December 2023"}

{"title":"Finally a good Star Trek again.","review":"After the deceptions of Star Trek Enterprise and Discovery I am pleasantly surprised there now is a good show. I still have to get used to seeing CGI in Star Trek but it is done perfectly. I liked the story and actors, Patrick Stewart shows his age on the outside, but still delivers in the acting department. Perhaps I should have rated 9 because I didn't get that Star Trek feel of the show, I guess having a bigger budget gives better visuals but I still like the simplicity of the old shows.

{"title":"Picard on a soapy pedestal","review":"For me, TNG Picard is by a clear head the best written and acted character from any ST. From that show, Data was the second best written and acted. So, giving Picard more story time and throwing in Data as a bonus ought, OUGHT, to have been a good idea. Go for a singe story series rather than anything episodic, for me should also have been a bonus. Unfortunately....What it feels like came out was Patrick Stewart, not Picard, and not any semblance to TNG. I'm no Trekkie so if all this has been discussed and I'm missing something that's why, but it really does feel as though Stewart has called far too many shots and been pandered to, leading to a very strong patronising whiff. Enough that I made it only to episode 2 (or was it 3? Not god enough for me to recall).I've read very negative reviews of Picard here that seem to put the TOS\/TNG etc Federation on a different pedestal, seeing it as altogether wonderful. Maybe this was Rodenberry's aim. But to me it too came across as patronising, being a very flimsily disguised \"USA is wonderful and everyone else will come around to our way\". The difference is that the TOS\/TNG pedestal\/patronising tone was also naive and at least had some potential and shared interest, unlike the Stewart pedestal, which is very narrow, with o chance of being shared\/universal.Beyond Stewart, it all felt rather soapy, overwritten and overacted. Unfortunately, I'm not sure what, if anything, could have been done about this as I find the vast majority of recent shows suffer the same fault. So I suspect any showrunner would have been tied on his, even if they appreciated the issue. And I'm probably an outlier on feeling there is a problem.So, why 3? Well, I persisted through to at least part way through episode 2 (or 3), so must have seen some potential in the story. Just not enough.","rating":"","date":"2 February 2022"}
{"title":"Live Long, and Falter","review":"This three-season outing following TNG's elder statesman has some genuinely poignant reprisals for the original crew and a handful of fairly solid new characters but for the first two seasons it was sluggish, deeply uneven and weighed down by wild contrivances. Initially it did seem a gallingly undignified send-off for one of Star Trek's most beloved characters but it managed to wrestle a decent final season despite itself. A wild ride.","rating":"7\/10","date":"7 May 2022"}
{"title":"This is NOT Star Trek...","review":"... It's what most of these negative reviews will have you believe. And when I read them harking for the good ol' days of TNG, I think to myself, \"Have they recently rewatched all of TNG?\" Better still, have they watched DS9 in its entirety at all? I am guessing the answer to both these questions is \"No.\"Without giving away any spoilers, let me just say a few things about STP for those who haven't watched any episodes yet. 1: This is NOT Star Trek. Well, to be more accurate, not the filtered, photoshopped, perfectly encased Star Trek you might remember. That is unless you have watched all of DS9 recently, because that is important. Why? Let's just say that DS9 demonstrates how Starfleet isn't the paradise the other Treks would have you believe. And one line by Sisko sums it up best: It's easy to be a saint in paradise. 2: This isn't Star Trek as you know it because it's not about Starfleet - it's about one person. Picard. Whether you agree or not, his character is one of, if not the most, iconic character ever produced. And the entire focus of this show is about him. Is that a little narcissistic? It might be, if the clue wasn't in the NAME OF THE SHOW! 3: \"How can Data be old? He's an Android!\" Well, true dat. But the actor who plays him has aged. So let's forgive the show for not being so authentic as to try to find a 20-something year old guy that looks like Brent Spiner and can pull off Data's voice, mannerisms, inflections and body language perfectly enough to ensure we don't have a bunch of other \"fans\" complaining that he is NOT \"my Data!\"In terms of the show, I liked the first season and am really liking the second so far. Sure, there's violence, swearing and a lot of CGI, but I can go into a million reasons why those things are a) necessary to appeal to the audience that grew up watching these shows and movies (I assume they're not trying to recruit teens to watch this show as their first introduction to Star Trek because, if they were, they would spend the first 15 years giving you backstories for context); and b) this is a review of Star Trek: Picard, not an essay diving into the entire ethos of Trek-dum and giving my million word response by saying something stupid like \"Gene Roddenbery would be rolling in his grave\", considering his SON is one of the producers of this show.Look, I get it. You want to watch Star Trek when it had monsters covered in printer ink and maple syrup, or when the Captain bangs every alien female he meets including a bunch of robots. That's what you think of the essence of Star Trek. I get that. Me, personally, saw things differently. As a mid-40's loser with a dead-end job, no money and no friends\/social life, I see, and have always seen, Star Trek for what it represents - not what the limitations of television and technology did 40 years ago. It's an ideal we aim to reach, but that's the thing about ideals - we are not meant to actually achieve them. The purpose is the journey, not the destination. Sure, TNG tells us that war, poverty, disease were all eradicated within 50 years of us realising we're not alone in the universe. But First Contact also taught us that, while we assume we've grown out of thoughts like revenge, hate, holding a grudge, those things are intrinsically human and will always be part of who we are. DS9 taught me that Starfleet had imperfections, like ambition, jealousy, xenophobia of those we don't understand. Heck, even Insurrection taught us that we are still capable of making morally corrupt decisions if they impact a small enough group of people to benefit a larger group. I can go on and on.My point is this: some will like this show, others won't, and that's exactly what's expected of us as humans. Some will harken for days that are etched more in memory than actual history. Others will cry out for a \"less is more\" philosophy. But if you're watching a show made in 2020 and expecting it to perfectly replicate one that originated on 1987, you're going to be incredibly mistaken.For the record, I don't like Discovery. Not because it's 'too woke' or whatever. I'm just tired of Star Trek making new crew-based shows that are prequels. I'd like one set in the 25th century, after the Dominion and Borg conflicts, after Voyager got home safely, after all that. Something new. Maybe Starfleet needs to rebuild, having lost many alliances during said conflicts, and are therefore seeking new allegiances? Maybe explore the Beta Quadrant now that the Romulans don't have such a monopoly in that part of the galaxy. Or what about the Gamma Quadrant, especially with the Dominion threat expelled? There are heaps of ideas just waiting to be explored, and, to me, Discovery was just another excuse to pretend to be a new show that was like the older shows, but when they realised it didn't fit into the timeline they hurtled it forward as a convenient way of saying \"All right, we get it, it's a futuristic ship set before the Enterprise, so let's send it to the future and make up a one line story that no one in Starfleet will ever talk about it again\".

How They ever accepted to film such basic material is beyond me.The nostalgia of other times makes us think that TNG was amazing... it was good, some times speactacular, but since the films it started declining constantly.The wonderment of yeaster-year (or however that word is written! English is not my main lagnuage, sorry!) is long gone, there's no discovery here, no going where we have never gone before...!THIS IS NO STAR TREK. It's just more of washed down crybaby explanatory drama that was introduced with Dicovery. Where everyone cries and forgets they are hardened characters that have literally seen worlds tear apart. Zero gravitas, just salt, explanation, and shallow tears.Don't waste your time seeing this, it will bring a bad taste to your mouth and tarnish your memories of what once was, even if idealized. I give it 2 stars for keeping up with \"diversity\" which luckily never was a problem for this series.The script looks like it was written by throwing darts at a mood board. No thought, no care for the characters, just the shortest way to the next action montage. Someone in the writing room would shout a topic, another would make it star warsy by adding a \"running away from the baddies\" conflict story line and then its 45m per episode of meaningless campy EXPLANATORY \"talks\".Someone didn't go to film school...

Uhhhh ..... yeah, she dies in the first episode.Plenty of people in the reviews are complaining about this show being darker, more dystopian, than original Trek ... because the Federation made a horrible, difficult decision. But one thing Trek has never shied away from is that humans aren't perfect; and this early on, we only have Picard's POV on what happened. Perhaps this will be a redemption arc for the Federation? Time will tell.I thought the first episode was fantastic: it had a perfect mix of exposition and mystery. It established a sense of Picard as lost, as drifting, and I think that's something else people are struggling with. Nobody likes to see their hero brought low and resigned to that fate.The second episode was a bit slow; not much action, more exploration of the various threads introduced before. But we see the beginning of Picard finding purpose again, struggling to find a way to accomplish what would have been easy for him before he left Starfleet, before he lost his status and power.I think this shows a lot of promise; and I still believe that Patrick Stewart would not have gotten involved if it were going to end up a mess.","rating":"7\/10","date":"7 February 2020"}

It seem to be less optimistic, so it has the more modern feel. I see why people see that this is too big step from optimistic attitude of previous Star trek series. But there is still hope in this, Human can be better and we should be better!\nI really like the feel of this series so far after season 1. Lets see what season 2 bring to the story. This is like DB9 but from the later seasons when things Are not going too well. It handles hard aspects of fear of different, fear of change, but Also worns the dangers we have to deal every time we make desisions. Are They right even if we do them we good intentions...\nThe show makes me think of my own heart, my own feelings and that is a good thing. A good start to a promising new Era in Star Trek.","rating":"9\/10","date":"12 March 2021"}

{"title":"Amazing First Season, but 2nd Season Trainwreck","review":"The first season was absolutely fantastic. Some of the best TV in years. Probably the best individual season of any Star Trek show, and I've seen all of them (except for anything after the first couple episodes of STD season 2, just can't stomach it).Then they handed off the showrunning, writing, and story editing duties to a completely new staff.The 2nd season started pretty strong, but got worse with every episode, cratering by the end. Nonsensical time-travel plot (always Trek's weakest point), strange amount of blatantly political statements about current events, weird awkward moments that seem like attempts at comedy, uncomfortable character interactions, rambling speeches, lack of respect or understanding of canon, terrible tactics, long emotional speeches in the middle of emergencies... it's not good. I haven't decided if I'll even try watching the third season, but I'm leaning towards no.","rating":"7\/10","date":"17 April 2022"}
{"title":"A Legacy in the Making...","review":"I have to admit the writing so far has been marvelous.

It's definitely different than previous Treks (Chabon's doing?), and took a bit more thought for me to get into... but once I did, I was glad.I have yet to watch one episode of Discovery, so I can't compare anything here to that. Picard seems a little more \"dark\" at times, or honestly more realistic. It's nice to see the militaristic idealism of TNG put to rest.There's room to nitpick. Name one Trek series where one couldn't! Someone said \"dude\" in the first episode, ridiculous looking tech, etc. Little crap like that is only annoying if you let it be.

{"title":"A Disappointing Finale for a Lifelong Star Trek Fan","review":"As a lifelong fan of Star Trek, I have been enthralled by the adventures of Starfleet and its iconic characters for as long as I can remember. I have seen all the series, all the movies, and have always looked forward to each new installment with great anticipation. So it was with a heavy heart that I watched the final season of Star Trek: Picard, which not only failed to live up to my expectations but felt like a complete mockery towards its viewers.The series began with such promise, bringing back the beloved Jean-Luc Picard and taking him on a new journey filled with mystery, intrigue, and the exploration of deep philosophical themes. However, as the season progressed, it became evident that the writing was losing its way, culminating in a finale that left me dumbfounded and deeply disappointed.The entire season built up the formidable threat of the Borg, an enemy that has terrified Star Trek fans for decades. Yet, when the time came for the climactic showdown, the battle against the Borg Queen was shockingly brief. In a mere two minutes, our heroes defeated the most powerful enemy they have ever faced, which felt like a slap in the face to viewers who had invested so much time and emotion in the series.Adding insult to injury, the resolution of the conflict was riddled with glaring inconsistencies and oversimplifications. Jack's sudden and inexplicable ability to strip off his Borg assimilation tech, along with the rapid recovery of all the young assimilated characters, stretched the limits of believability and left a bitter taste in my mouth.The final episode of Star Trek: Picard was nothing short of a joke. As a die-hard fan, I cannot help but feel betrayed by the way the series ended. Instead of honoring the legacy of Star Trek, the creators seemed to have thrown it all away in a poorly executed finale that left me, and many others, utterly disheartened.In conclusion, Star Trek: Picard's last season was a massive letdown for this lifelong fan. The haphazard writing and the disappointing finale did a disservice to the rich history of the Star Trek universe and its loyal fanbase. One can only hope that future installments in the franchise will learn from these mistakes and return to the compelling storytelling and nuanced exploration of moral and ethical dilemmas that made Star Trek such an enduring and beloved phenomenon in the first place.","rating":"5\/10","date":"20 April 2023"}

{"title":"Season 1: What's with the negative reviews?","review":"I can't understand the dismissive reviews of Picard Season 1. It has depth and is very layered, with a strong, clever storyline. The new concepts are in keeping with an evolved Star Trek universe, as well as a Picard who is in his 90s and emerging after twiddling his thumbs for 14 years in retirement. He's got the same wisdom, leadership, compassion and sardonic humor, and it would have been unrealistic for him to jump right back into take-charge certainty with the same vigor. This Picard is still compelling, just in a new way as he navigates his return. The new characters are interesting and introduced well, each with their own individual back stories for good diversity. Elements of past Trek stories, as well as past characters, are re-introduced and advanced very organically and not heavy-handedly; it's fresh. It all makes sense and is very cohesive. Each episode has action, twists and suspense. All I can imagine is that viewers were expecting basically the same Star Trek but with older characters. This is much better than a pale re-make and can stand proudly on its own!","rating":"8\/10","date":"22 July 2023"}
{"title":"A thoughtful series, if a little dense","review":"As the title implies, I enjoyed Picard, and it was an interesting epilogue to \"Star Trek: the Next Generation.\" My one quibble is that for all it's trying to accomplish, the pacing just didn't quite work. The first four hour-long episodes function as the pilot, leaving little room to maneuver in the backhalf to untangle the mystery they've set up. The conspiracy dealing with Romulans and artificial intelligence was intriguing, but felt a little convoluted and rushed given they had to unwind it all so quickly. Personally, I wish it didn't deal so exclusively with Romulans and Borg gave us a little more variety -- but that might be my own yearning for the \"episode of the week\" format that classic Trek follows.All that said, I enjoyed this series and appreciate all it was trying to accomplish.","rating":"8\/10","date":"31 December 2021"}
{"title":"Sigh...smh, Disappointment","review":"Ok, so this series, it's got cool graphics, they updated the CGI to 2023... Cool. But, that's all it's got.Unfortunately, today's exec's tend to throw money at these types of shows. So, all the money goes to bringing back some icons and CGI development...Meanwhile, interns out of college are \"supposed\" to be the Segway between the older gens and the younger... Unfortunately, they have no talent in creative writing, it's all systems, patterns and recipes in standard narrative. This show is Sooooooooooo dull!I like the icons based on their past shows... Not this one. So, why am I watching this. And, the new younger characters don't even have a personality or anything that makes me like them, Probably because they're disposable or will get written off.It's so disappointing that the last star trek with any good plot, characters or writing was Voyager.Stop hiring these interns with no perspective to write for characters with years of experience. The lines don't make any sense and they're trying too hard to make it \"cool\" for kids. But, that's catering to immaturity and unrealistic stupid story content.Good shows are built on good writing, with good character development. And, teens will like a show that is well done because everyone likes shows that are well done, and older people deserve shows to be well done! This show is sloppy, cheesy and the lines are are just absurd and immature. The only thing this show has going for it is the graphics and some icons mere presence... That is all. Huge disappointment after waiting three decades for a good star trek reboot, this, discovery and new worlds .. all junk, and I'll bet the execs can see the poor viewer stats aren't adding up. It's because they're not balancing the development with good writers anymore. 20 yr old interns making $30k a year to write these episodes while crews produce these episodes like a factory is a joke! It's offensive to watch these execs take great stories and destroy them for a cheap date.","rating":"","date":"12 May 2023"}

To me, nothing was ever quite like it on television.Then I heard about the \"Picard\" series and had serious doubts. I felt they'd decided to do this 15 years too late. I even dragged my foot making time to watch the first episode. But...it's REALLY good. Of course, we're only past episode 2, so who knows where\/how it will go, but the writing is well done so far, and the characters are true to what they were (Picard, for sure), plus the new cast is well cast (Orla Brady! Isa Briones!). Of course, it's also 2020 and I'd love to binge the series, I mean...who waits to watch episodes on a weekly basis anymore?! Nevertheless, I'm now invested in the story and (*SPOILERS*) with the appearance of old enemies (Romulans, Borg), who can not want to watch this?I'm very excited at this point to keep following the TNG crew and hope it continues to live up to what we've been shown so far.

Why on earth they need to put violent gory scenes like that in Star Trek as well as the multiple F-bombs make no sense to me. The plot is slow and boring, the characters are dull and you don't really care about them, you just wish they were like they were in TNG, but they are no where near as likeable, and the unneeded gory violence and swearing is completely off putting.

Maybe this was the point but the writers have got this terribly wrong.What would have been so wrong with bringing a retired Picard back to active duty to face some genuine new threat, maybe a resurgent Borg with Picard and 7 of 9 mankinds best hope. Re-assemble some of the team and keep the pacing brisk and a new generation will fall in love with the characters and ensemble but what we get is pitiful.Sack all the writers, get a new show-runner and give us a good character driven story with heart as this was the attraction of TNG and testament to its enduring appeal even to this day.Picard Season 1, hit the delete button.","rating":"2\/10","date":"12 May 2020"}

Made me genuinely happy to watch something new. TNG, much like the original Star Trek series, always had a bit of an improvised feel with over the top costumes and the candy store color schemes to me, while at the same time taking the topics of the plots very seriously.

{"title":"Not sure what supposed \"Star Trek fans\" are babling on about","review":"To start, I want to say that I consider myself a big Star Trek fan with DS9 being my favourite although I respect series like TNG and the Original Series.Wasn't really a big fan of Voyager or Enterprise although both shows had their moments. To put it simply, I watched the trailer for Picard months ago and it seemed like a welcome and better change from the newer ST movies and series like Discovery that had big potential but I don't think they quite hit the mark.Without stating too much of the obvious, it's about an aged Jean-Luc Picard and wanting to understand and unravel some very interesting events that unfold before him, both within the two decades since TNG ended and in the present (Present as in the time period that he's living in). It's definitely interesting to watch and I'm loving the way the story is unfolding (Presently on Episode 6).Call this a \"paid\" review or written by a millenial (I'm 40 years old, by the way), I don't care, but I think some fans just need to grow up and accept that there are plenty of people out there who are enjoying this new series and are very eager to see how it pans out. I'm reminded of Stargate Universe and how, when it was cancelled, it signalled the death of the entire franchise for now. I was very vocal about how Stargate Universe sucked at the time but now regret it and I'd rather the same thing not happen to ST.","rating":"10\/10","date":"3 March 2020"}

{"title":"different but that's to be expected","review":"Picard is a series which allows you to combine the benefits of a somewhat matured mindset with the undiluted belief in good of a teenager. Like so many of you I watched TNG in my teens and I loved it. The physics and mystery behind it all was so fascinating that it was one of the reasons I started my studies in physics. The mystery and the physics behind it all usually served the purpose to raise moral questions. And Jean-Luc Picard was a fantastic travel companion on that trip.The show tries to transport the sentiment of that time to our modern concept of TV series. It is great to see him in his role again and the cameos of the various Star Trek legends alone make it worthwhile.\nHowever I feel that Picard has not returned to his former glory yet. I miss his superior aura. I hope that he will get it over the next few episodes, but so far it feels as if the producers wanted to point out that Picard aged and is no longer as steadfast as he once was. I get it that they want to portray him as a man disillusioned by Starfleet, which I like, but I believe that they could have done that without stripping him of his picardesque poise. Unfortunately I couldn't warm up to many of the other characters so far, but I haven't given up hope yet.","rating":"7\/10","date":"6 March 2020"}

{"title":"Subtract one star if you are a Star Trek fan.","review":"Sci Fi stories can be far fetched. They can't be ludicrous. Here we have a bizarre plot centered on the Romulan attempt to destroy all android life. After a deadly revolt of androids (now called \"synths\") on Mars, the Federation bans synth production and Picard's fight to save the Androids is a battle against the Feds and the Romulans. Although Romulan responsibility is implied, exactly how they caused the revolt is never explained, though it is possible that I slept through that part, which is understandable if you watch this dreck. Since the story is not convoluted enough they add sub plots that add nothing to the story such as the Romulan sun going nova and Star Fleet divided over whether or not they should help, which they kind of do, though after seeing the armada the Romulans can put together I'm not sure why they would need help. Also not sure what the hell was going on with the Borg cube. They made it looked like Seven was going to bring it to Picard's rescue but that went nowhere, though I guess it's purpose was to help pad this out to the ten excruciating episodes. Which would also explain the Jedi battles on the cube (Yoda should sue) and the massacre of Borg and ex-Borgs.So Picard and his merry band of misfits, which is sadly missing a cowardly lion, go on their quest to save a planet of androids all built from one positronic neuron from Data in yet another instance where making sense was no impediment to the story. Too many examples to mention them all, but here are just a few: one of Data's android children is killed by being stabbed in the eye; one of our heroes is a cold blooded killer, which no one seems to care about; one of our band uses a sword in a battle against phasers (Luke Skywalker should sue); pizza making hippies living in the woods, Riker and Troi, have a young daughter though they should be her grandparents (maybe Betazeds don't have menopause or it's an in vitro thing); and they also had a son who died, ostensibly, but needlessly, to make a a point about the value of synths. To add to the death of an unknown character, and since some of the movies felt the need to kill off a beloved one (Spock, Kirk, Data) why not up the ante and kill a few more here: Hugh, Data (again) and Picard (temporarily, like Spock). And then there's Icheb. Not just killed but horrifically tortured first. If Mengele like treatment is entertainment for you, skip this and tune in to some slasher movies.The perfect complement to this drawn out and terrible story are cartoonish characters, such as the rugged cigar chomping pilot and Star Fleet exile (Han Solo should sue) but especially the evil murderous Romulan who must be an homage to Cruella DeVille.As far as the actors who are too long in the tooth for this stuff, and to paraphrase Mel Brooks, this should be subtitled: \"The Search for More Money\". As for me, I think I'll go watch some episodes of Star Trek TOS to cleanse my intellectual palate.","rating":"2\/10","date":"24 February 2021"}
{"title":"This isn't a TNG Sequel","review":"So I'm a die-hard ST:TNG fan. I can probably quote most of the episodes, and I often leave the show on repeat in the background of my home while doing daily tasks like laundry or dishes. Honestly, if I look back at it with adult eyes (and not the teenage eyes when it was originally aired), I see that it's pretty cheesy in a lot of ways. The characters have some good writing, but there was a ton of (at the time) \"current\" social commentary coupled with unbelievable plot fixes. As for continuity, there were at least four episodes in which major characters from ST:TOS appeared as major or minor characters in TNG, and one major motion picture shows the twice-over death of Kirk as a cross-over film.None of that is a problem; in fact, it's what most people come to expect from all Star Trek franchises. The problem I see with many of the reviews here is in the expected concept of Star Trek: Picard. I think that some of the reviewers on this site seem to want that 90s version of ST:TNG here in ST:P. They want a TNG sequel here.But those same reviewers seem to forget the movies which are also part of the franchise and were produced after the television series. I thought some of those were cheesy too (Insurrection, anyone?)... and while First Contact was definitely the best of the bunch, Nemesis was gritty, dark, and just plain sad. Unfortunately, ST:P comes in the storyline after Nemesis... and there is a direct link from this film, rather than from the 90s television show. If seen through that angle, the show makes a lot more sense. The whole first season seems to be, at its heart, an epilogue to that film which had (to me) a very open ending.Yes, there do seem to be elements of capitalism in ST:P, but DS9 had an unhealthy relationship with gold-pressed latinum, in my opinion, and there were several TNG episodes (\"The Price,\" \"Haven,\" \"Bloodlines,\" \"The Perfect Mate\") where money or gifts or prices are discussed. So while First Contact shows Riker and Troi telling Cochrane about poverty and want vanishing after his warp-induced encounter with an alien race, the truth is actually a little more complex.But all of this is in the backstory of ST:P. Here we have Picard, the character, who is truly a human... beset by regrets and his own failings, and we see what can happen to a person who has been at the height of his career and power who is truly thwarted by a far-reaching conspiracy. If we look back at a lot of his character's arc in both the television show and the movies, it's usually been less Picard who was saving the day and more the other characters working with him... Data especially.In this season, we are introduced to the fascinating idea of an \"ex\" Borg cube, which shows those who were previously assimilated (like Picard himself) trying to pick up the pieces of their lives. I hear echoes of \"Descent\" in the Hugh story.The delightful backstory of the synth homeworld (or, at least, where Soong and Maddox do their work) with its synthetic cats and butterflies and planet-defense-orchids is imaginative and reminiscent of many \"away\" missions. For that matter, the Mom-AI that Soji accesses and the Narek-meditation sequence were extremely thought-provoking for this sci-fi-nerd. And of course I loved hearing echoes of \"Measure of a Man\" in Soji's question to Jurati \"Am I a Person?\"We also now have an \"after-story\" for not only Picard and Data, but Troi and Riker (with a daughter named Kestra from TNG's \"Dark Page\") and this was one of the best episodes of the series. I also loved meeting Rios and his emergency holographic versions of himself.TL:DR- if you go into this show wanting a ST:TNG sequel, you are going to be disappointed. But if you watch the series as a continuation of the TNG franchise, keeping in mind the gap in time that has passed since the films, you might be as satisfied as I have been.","rating":"9\/10","date":"7 April 2021"}

{"title":"The first two seasons stink but season three is a knockout!","review":"Very flawed Star Trek series that finally picked up in the last year.Boring characters, terrible plots, a sleepy looking lead character, the F-word being spoken in Star Trek. Some viewers will be so let down by the first two seasons that they simply will not get to season three - but you must see the final year!Like many others, I could not make it through all of season one and season two - it was just so bad! Thankfully they dumped a few idiots from the first two years and put things back on track in season three!You can totally follow the last season without watching the first two years. Granted, some characters make reference to the fact that Picard has changed a bit since the motion pictures of the 90s, this will be a tiny bit confusing to new viewers. But other than that, you will be fine jumping into the last year without watching the revolting opening seasons. Enjoy!","rating":"","date":"30 January 2024"}
{"title":"ReStart Trek","review":"Can androids age? Well, the opening shots of this new series reuniting us with Admiral (Retd.) formerly captain Jean Luc Picard of the U. S. S. Enterprise, would have us think so as a visibly older Data plays a game of chess with his old captain. When the apparently happily retired Picard awakes from what turns out to be a dream encounter with his previously sacrificed crew-member, it's not until later in the episode where we realise the significance of this and indeed Data to the storyline, indeed Picard later has another dream-meeting with his old colleague just to further reinforce the point.Then the story cuts to a young woman whose stay-indoors night with her boyfriend is brutally cut short by the materialisation of a Romulan hit squad who take out the boyfriend only for the girl herself to snap into explosive action as a whirlwind fighting machine to save herself. But why does an image of Picard whom she's never met appear in her mind?Both these strands are brought together skilfully in a story which even at this early stage promises viewers equal amounts of intrigue and nostalgia as it progresses.While it was great to see Patrick Stewart fully inhabit his old character again and walk in that distinctive semi-hunched fashion of his, he is unquestionably older and slower in his movements and delivery. The energy will come, I presume, from his bright young companion and I look forward to seeing how it all pieces together in future episodes.Just how many past cast-members will make it back to rejoin their old captain remains to be seen and I wait to see if that closing image of a massive Borg-like space-structure has any greater significance too. Did I like the intrusion of ninja-type fights into the narrative, probably not, but I reluctantly have to accept that if the show is to reach out to a wider audience beyond old Trekkies like me, maybe it's something I'll just have to endure. Likewise, the series will obviously be following a story-arc rather than different stand-alone episodes as in the past. This is the way all the rival DC and Marvel shows run I guess and is also unsurprising in this day and age.Otherwise, with largely pleasing CGEN SFX and what sounds on first listen a pleasant theme tune, I'm looking forward to engaging (sorry) with Jean Luc in his new mission.","rating":"7\/10","date":"26 January 2020"}

{"title":"Potential, But First Episode Had Issues","review":"The series looks to have potential.The main problem I had with this first episode all comes down to one scene...the fight scene in the city where Picard cowers like a scolded dog....this scene acted like the rest of this bustling, modern city completely vanished just in time for the attack. No bystanders, witnesses, video, security, nothing. Just the 2 main characters and the enemy were all that conveniently seemed to exist in the whole world at that moment. If this is the effect they wanted, they could have easily had the altercation occur somewhere more private, not out in the open when moments before there were hundreds of people milling about. The lack of human presence all of a sudden was so jarring and odd that it completely took away from the scene and the first episode as a whole...then to add insult to injury, Picard is magically back in his bed at home. No hospital? No security asking questions? No one at all asking about what happened? No evidence left of a battle or the explosion?With sci-fi, partially suspending belief is to be expected, but what they pulled in that scene....smh.I hope this was a one off occurrence due to an oversight in the storyline that is geared more towards being told in space rather than in a modern earth city, but regardless, it doesn't give me hope in the direction or editing.I'll continue to watch because of the teaser at the end, but if it weren't for adding that, I probably would have called it quits after this first episode.*Side note....I have no problem with strong females kicking , just so long as it isn't jammed down your throat like it was in the new Terminator movie. Seeing Picard run, cower, hide, and look terrified while he let a young woman he just promised seconds before to never leave her, fight and die by herself while he shook and hid did not sit well, and I truly hope this isn't a precedent they've set going forward.","rating":"7\/10","date":"25 January 2020"}

This is like a marvel drama movie slapped with the Star Trek name on it. I can't believe the other actors signed up to make a cameo for this awful garbage. Alex Kurtzman needs to be sued into oblivion for ripping off other tv shows and black listed never allowed to make a show again. Do not watch this by any means. The show makes no sense. Picard acts like a 100yr old man when he runs up stairs with that girl to help him and he gets turned into a android and still acts old lmao. These Romulo so also look stupid. They're just bringing old characters back because they know the ratings are awful and they're desperate. Boycott this show at all costs.","rating":"1\/10","date":"18 February 2022"}

The speed is just perfect to contrast with the actual tendency of making just an action storm on every episode.\nAnd the essence of Roddenbery is still there, preserved on Piccard's optimism on peaple, dignity and hope.\nThis show is the best startrek made since Voyager. It do not play with the past (an advisory from Roddenbery that was ignored by the writers after him).","rating":"10\/10","date":"13 March 2020"}

Picard in several situations seems to not make the right call only to have the women around him educate him . This is Picard the legend, the admiral the man who has now been portrayed as a weak old man that has to often times take a back seat to his stronger female characters.

You have ruined the whole story line.","rating":"1\/10","date":"7 May 2022"}

{"title":"First season is awesome, second season really bad. I have hopes for #3","review":"The premise of this show is good. The first season had a lot of intrigue, mystery, some good action, interesting characters, and an overall star-trek universe feel. It was good.But the second season - that's pretty bad. First off, the whole season takes place in the past. That's not what we came for! Star trek is about space, sci-fi, etc. A full season in 2024 is just... not star trek. We watch ST for the universe and lore that we love, not to see earth as it is today. Even putting that aside, the season was not great. The focus on picard's mental state made it even more boring.The ending was not bad though, and I do have high hopes for season 3! Hopefully it will be back to the roots of Star Trek and not some alternate-reality \/ time-travel thing.","rating":"7\/10","date":"15 May 2022"}
{"title":"Gene Roddenberry would like this","review":"Well, this was nice surprise. I mean not that new Star Trek * serial started - according to my small research Star Trek is what has most new serials with that name in title, even some not really in spirit of original, etc.\nPatrick Stewart at age of 80 is still good actor, his voice shows his age, but he has what is more important: spirit, care for people, life. And that would be approx. about what first episode is. With some shorter action scenes, memories ...\nFor me, this is perfect start.And I must again talk about reviews here. Looked some (was 40 in that moment), and must say that this is worst what I seen at IMDB. Starting with total false claims that P. Stewart is 94 years, communist, then that all characters are white, copies Expanse ...\nHow on Earth such crap passes IMDB submission control ? Because I seen about 10 comments (among 40) which were pure trolling. And even did not read all 40.And I was never some big fan of Next Generation, actually it was aired in period when I barely watched TV. Best Sci-Fi serial for me in last couple years - OK, should not say it after only 1 ep. , but truth is that nothing started so well.\nI'm tuned :-)","rating":"10\/10","date":"23 January 2020"}
{"title":"Overall enjoyable but slaughters Star Trek","review":"I really like Picard, it's enjoyable and I feel a bit more diverse with alien cultures, I like the rogue feel. I like the odd cameo's of other actors too.That said there is stuff which is cringe worthy - for example cigars on a bridge by a captain and a crew disobeying direct orders - it's basically solo. The way Picard's crew in season 2 suddenly get ranks and access to whole starships; like the federation has no structure. Naff explanations of stuff; in one episode they talk about physically rewiring a sub routine! It's like the writers have had a 2hour crash course in Star Trek and have absolutely no understanding about it. You'd think Patrick Stewart would have had a bit of integrity there and putting it right.The action is intense, and each episode sort of keeps you guessing and there are additional stories within the main season story which is good. Can't fault that at all. So the writers ain't bad, but they ain't Star Trek good.The android story in season 1 is good but again towards the end feels a little like avengers and just gets painfully ridiculous in the finale. I haven't seen season 3 yet but am looking forward to it. I think this show would be better maybe having completely dropped star fleet and the federation or being a show in its own right and maybe something like the marquis so same universe but separate enough to not pollute what is Star Trek.I don't think this is as good as strange new worlds or lower decks, it's probably just a bit better than discovery.Given a 6\/10!","rating":"6\/10","date":"3 November 2023"}
{"title":"Nothing makes sense for a serialized show","review":"The characters in this series can't stay on task or remember their own purpose for more than a few scenes at a time. Abilities used in one episode are discarded the next, seemingly for no reason but building tension in the scene. There are no real stakes involved. Without giving spoilers, the show is about Captain (now Admiral) Picard and his crew being sent back in time to restore the timeline, yet the reason for the change is never really explored. Also, the crew talks about \"butterflies\" changing the timeline, while leaving a trail of destruction and suspicion in their wake, seemingly without consequence. The lack of self-awareness by the writers and producers betrays a lack of thought or concern for the believable, as well as a lack of respect for the intelligence of a typical science fiction audience. The thought-provoking pillars of science fiction are discarded for cheap callbacks to a once proud and beloved franchise.","rating":"1\/10","date":"19 April 2022"}

{"title":"A Thousand Reviews to Ignore!","review":"There are some reviews here- well, all of them, actually- which could be safely ignored. Some people seem to think Star Trek past was a warm blanket, its purpose being to comfort and console folks that the future is going to be a lovely chat on philosophical problems in a pastel coloured conference room. Star Trek has always dealt with the issues of the day, and not always in a sweet, harmless manner.Star Trek: The Next Generation was made when America was at the height of its power and cosiness. The world today is a different place, and a Star Trek which does not reflect that is pointless. Star Trek: Picard takes place twenty years after the last film of that particular cast of characters. The Federation has taken a turn. Politics and human nature have soured. Further. Again. What a surprise. Conspiracies weave admittedly slightly overwrought threads. But Picard is on to them. Who he is now, how he got here and where he is destined to wind up have wandered very far from where we left him two decades ago and hundreds of years in the future. However, it should be pointed out, contrary to several hundred of these reviews, the means by which Picard hopes to right nefarious wrongs and confront the poison of fear, is by using optimism, openness, love and technology. So, the same Picard, essentially, as in the good old days.This is not the Star Trek of sitting around on sofas saying, \"And what do YOU think we should do?\" Characters get their hands dirty, they get things wrong, they screw up, they try again to do better. They often fail.This is not Star Trek: Next Generation. But give it a chance, and maybe it will be Star Trek: Your Generation.","rating":"7\/10","date":"18 March 2020"}
{"title":"L.A. Trek","review":"I don't know what I expected, but I expected more than this. The actors are all OK with one exception, and I'm not sure whether the main fault with Michelle Hurd is that she is not a good actor or her character has nothing to do except to be pointlessly petulant. John de Lancie is fun-- I wish that he was around more than he is. Patrick Stewart tries to inject some gravitas into the proceedings, but too often comes across as a cranky ponderous grandpa, whom few would follow to the corner store, let alone to the ends of the universe.There are two major problems with the second season. The first is that the plot is terrible, bordering on non-existent. The cast is stuck in 21st century LA, where nothing interesting happens. None of the story arcs are interesting, let alone compelling. There is no Star Trekking going on-- it's just dullsville. I don't know whether it is laziness, lack of original ideas, or budget cuts, but it is just bad TV. There are a few good moments, but most episodes feel like pointless filler, killing time until... well, we don't know, because nothing much ever happens.The second, related problem is the terrible writing. The writers have nothing interesting to say and they aren't good enough to dress up the lack of ideas with a distracting sense of fun and\/or adventure.The only social commentary here is banal and heavy-handed: 1. Homelessness is bad; and 2. ICE shouldn't bully undocumented immigrants. Politically, I completely agree with both points, but the commentary here is so shallow and obvious that it doesn't accomplish anything except make me roll my eyes into the back of my head. Still watching, but not really enjoying it.Even after learning to loathe Discovery after a decent first season, and being sorely disappointed in Picard, I am still foolish enough to hold out some hope for Strange New Worlds....","rating":"2\/10","date":"17 April 2022"}

There is a flaw inherent to season three. For it to strike the right chords, they had to bring in the old timers. Young audiences probably don't want to watch their grandparents do battle with old enemies, but for story telling purposes it just feels right. Eliminate some of the confusing explanations for some of the events and you have a classic. The greatest of all Star Trek crews. Always rely on the basics. The music cues could have been used more effectively. They always rouse the Trekkies. It was far from perfect but it was emotionally satisfying. It left me wanting more. It drew me back to the 90s when it aired on paramount. Good times!","rating":"8\/10","date":"22 May 2023"}

The story was great and very engaging and it put an end to one of the unfinished chapters of Star Trek saga, the Borg.

{"title":"No Warp Speed?","review":"Would Picard like to do his missions in slow ships without warp drive? Great story told very awkwardly and slowly. It often jumps to keep pace but ultimately disatisfies with short episodes that are over before the story moves forward to a satisfying degree. Picard feels old but very likeabe. Without him I would not have bothered watching. All the characters are cool. The pace of the story is geriatric. It takes a more grown up look with mild adult harshness which is quite a welcome as opposed to shallow, gay playfullness with intergalactic planet destruction. Also, strange French accent creeps in sometimes. Nowhere near the quiality of The Mandalorian. I would still recommend it with the above caveats.","rating":"6\/10","date":"1 March 2020"}
{"title":"Worst Trek Series Yet","review":"Who is this Picard character? He has no resemblance to the character of the same name in Star Trek: TNG. The writers clearly think that everything about the older Star Trek series can be improved by insulting everyone who doesn't think the way that they euphemistically \"think\". Be prepared from episode one to have a five pound suppository of politics shoved up your sphincter.To be fair, I haven't seen the final season, and I do not plan to watch it. I would most likely end up with with a a bloody scalp from pulling my hair out.I do not think that Paramount could do more harm to the Star Trek franchise if they swore a blood oath to destroy Star Trek for all time.","rating":"1\/10","date":"8 February 2023"}
{"title":"Don't get nostalgic just yet","review":"I had put off watching Picard on account of the hype, and not being a fan of more recent Star Trek releases. I suppose I'm too nostalgic for STNG (which I grew up on), though after overcoming ingrained bias I also came to love Voyager equally.Had I known I would see some of my favourite actors (from the likes of The Newsroom, The Three Mustakeers TV series, and Scorpion) I would not have waited so long.Back to Picard.It's slow to start, though not unbearably, carrying the sense of mystery as do recent series, dark, less Americanised (though not free of it), and ultimately enjoyable.The characters fall in love before the viewer does (therefore lacking viewer investment in the relationship) but my love for the actors previous roles overcame those barriers to some extent.Ultimately, it just may hook some new viewers to the franchise, but lovers of old may not fall so readily.","rating":"8\/10","date":"6 March 2023"}
{"title":"It's familiar faces and references but not yet what i love","review":"I really love star trek of the 90's. There is some magic about it. The characters are rich, the stories are timeless. What i love about that era of star trek is very simple. It's about extraordinary people in a futuristic environment. People that managed to become the best version of themselves, while not being that different from anyone else. It's about exploration and the discovery of the mysteries of the unknown. The storytelling though, is what made it special. There is mystery and wonder, people who try to make the world better, it's Utopian, but often fits into what i believe. The narrative is positive, the storytelling mostly concludes in a good way. Either that, or you are left pondering a complex philosophical question, that can be equally satisfying. That is what i love about the 90s era star trek.Now, season 1 of Picard is honestly missing some of that. I feel like i am watching the Marvel, Stargate, Star Wars version of Star Trek. Maybe because the writers hoped, that familiar faces and references to Star Trek lore, might be enough to attract the people whom truly love the franchise. At the same time, using action movie storytelling and cinematic, to draw in a new, maybe younger crowd. But I think they are wrong, it is not needed. The positive narrative, the bond between rich characters and the resolving of mysterious phenomena, worlds, alien life and interactions, is beyond age groups. As long as you can attach a philosophical question to it, something we can apply to our real lives. That is all the action and spectacle needed.Season one had some real potential, but i really had to force myself through it.Even though i muddled through, the last episode of season one, still ended very beautifully and left me emotional, the only part that felt recognizable. I have hope for season 2...","rating":"7\/10","date":"21 December 2023"}

Picard (to begin with), the captain is fun along with the EMH and there are some nice cameos.It starts of very promisingly, shares some great potential but unfortunately all that potential is completely tossed aside for schmaltzy cameos, dull villains and a very pedestrian ending. Why is the official uniforms of \"baddies\", black?It happens with a number of other TV series. They always have great ideas and just descend into filler episodes and by the end just struggle to keep the main plot in focus.....which by that time is so convoluted and contrived, that the whole thing becomes a chore to finish. But finish you do because this is Star Trek and this is Picard and Data is mentioned and the Borg are referenced and all goodies that ultimately serve to nothing really.The big bad that threatens, at the end, oh come on....it's stupid.The budget is big, the execution is lacking.Ah well. Opportunity lost.If you want to see how to take a universe and add to it with originality, new perspective and love, then watch The Mandalorian and see how it's done.I love Voyager. I love Star Trek.

'What a huge steaming pile of excrement'. It has no redeeming features on any level. Star Trek's strength was its positive view of 'what if' in a universe that encouraged optimism. Set in the Kelvin universe (you can tell by the warp nacells of the Fed starshipd) this Series is poorly written, leadenly paced and its cynically use of old friends is a prostitution of a once great concept.If you're a ST fan I'd recommend avoiding it.

I grew up watching TNG and although I love it, it had the robotic, predictable constraints of a studio show that had to put out 26 episodes a year. Picard is an evolution in storytelling that's adding a fantastic amount of depth to the franchise. It acknowledges that the universe can be a dark place and even the best of institutions can fall prey to the darker side of our own humanity.I'm shocked at how fantastic the writing is and the cast is blowing it out of the water with amazing moments from so many of the actors.","rating":"10\/10","date":"9 March 2020"}
{"title":"Sprinkling of brilliance with bizarre unnecessary use of language","review":"Patrick Stewart revisiting an older, emotionally burnt Picard makes for an acting highlight. No one stays the same through their life, and Picard is no different here. It's a nice take, and the story starts nicely, peppering snippets of nostalgia along the way. Mentions, easter eggs and friends of days past keep the show ticking over with Stewart acing every line he's given. The theme tune too, is wonderful. The story slowly simmers along. Possibly too slow for some viewers.But the writers seem to waver in and out of what Star Trek is. Every fan has their opinion, and this is of course, is just mine. There's dialogue regarding the passage of time, death and mortality - and this IS what Trek should be, and is. It's thoughtfully written. Poignant. The writers and showrunner get it. But then they throw in unnecessary course, sexual and suggestive language which completely took me out of every episode it featured it - which was quite a few. It's as if the writers believe using this type of language makes a show seem more mature. Like they could not write dialogue to achieve the same goal intelligently. It doesn't belong in Trek, and it's was very, very jarring. Hence the enjoyment level of each episode, and overall rating isn't higher.Hopefully a course correction on that front for season two, or unfortunately this fan is sadly out.

{"title":"Androids don't have generations either","review":"Early news of this series said it will be different from everything else ST. Sounded like a very small budget series about only one character. So I thought they would tell about a captain who has lost his way and wants to escape from things or find them somewhere in a galaxy without even a ship. Original fans would swallow none of it, but the whole story would be told by new secrets and bad memories so that anyone could watch it. They wouldn't have to write about the federation in any special way as a good or bad society, because as individuals this captain's job would bring mostly misery around him.So what was going on in this Picard, the first problem is that nothing has really gone that bad for P and he doesn't need much redemption and other characters fill this show. He is still the person who fixes the federation, from the whole android hate perhaps, but this is a problem the story maybe never needed to have if there had not been fans asking for a return to so called original federation. It will now look like there is a completely capable and willing to deliver fed in season 2. But I think what happens with this is already seen recently in STD S2 where the bright eye crew is saving the galaxy. It will not be any better unless you also ask for a galaxy that is divided in small sections of interesting people who differer from fed culture in great measure bringing other kinds of problems. Or you have ask for a crew that is perfectly defined to fit your desires (infact current Picard crew can clearly change into anything).I'm writing about the plot weaknesses next if they are there or not.Society can change alot when someone triggers a genocide on a planet, or it can atleast on the planet next to it. Series doesn't ponder much about what Klingon, Vulcan etc. homeworlds want to do with their synths and if they are supposed to be ruled by the Earth opinion. (I think those worlds live in totalitarian societies or under the tyranny of majority that forces people to die during things like matrimony rituals because it is the way of their majority that no one from outside has been able to change since their space faring history.) For these fed decicion makers it is weird they would not see the revolting synths as a hand of some evil entity, probably within themselves, and would end up in cutting just one hand.Romulan refugees are spending their time at a bar. They probably want to say that the whole empire collapsed and many of their people no longer belive in rebuilding any society in stars. If they are missing something they could ask for it from the secret romulans that every other races know are there. Phone calls that would change people's lives and plot problems aren't in much use until the last episode.Synths on mars look like robots that are programmed for one job and come with some special apps. They do not really count as android life forms made by Soong, unless they have equally advanced technology making up their brains, in which case they should be living free unless Mars accepts slave labor. All the time the series makes other poor comparisons between life, AIs and robot things that can kill fed's babys, one when the latino ship is allowed to have hologram programs that oversee things like medical issues. And when a Soong guy shuts down Sutra without a trial just because it was made by him and misbehaving. At that point he didn't think that Sutra evolves, if put to prison or community service.On the other hand when P discovers robots that he can tell are programmed with false memories (unlike Data) and behaviour blocks and commands that sent them to key places, none of the characters (including those who were fed intel service) don't bother warning him that theese robots pretending to be humans (unlike D) have clearly been sent to spy on someone. And that they are not a living free consciousness but only extensions of their master's coding that can activate in any possible way at any moment, kind of like Mars.However the story never gives a good reason for the first sisters to leave the android home. I mean they didn't know there was a star system with 8 suns that holds the secret how to call for aid from more synths if they need it to take out a secret Romulan fleet. And the only reason anyone found out about them was that they didnt stay out of everyone else's space. To make Dahjs look more like living beings they could have said that they volunteered to go when Sutra got bored, and then blocked their own brains.In TNG it was often repeated I think that only Soong was able to make living androids and that Data and Lore were the last ones that would ever come. (It is a very important thing in D storyline perhaps next to him dying, and the most important thing about Lore dying.) Very smart from Picard to insist that science is repeatable, but I think they just meant that there would be some thousands of years before reaching Soong notes. Picard is more about prophecies and dreams and computer-flesh-psychic-vulcan connections. If something needs solving the answer is in the modern version of the internet.When romulans connect with the historical aid package, it supposedly holds the information of building a transmitter in a coded form, which would exist in the brain of an agent as a long thought of a lot of jargon, which they then do not bother to (not-) associate with anything in their mission. Either that or the connection is just like what the viewer sees on screen, a short spin of images, which needs a synth brain to hit a pause to reveal any details.","rating":"","date":"5 April 2020"}
{"title":"Post Ep4 and we are still in prologue","review":"Hopefully, eventually Picard may get going, the first 4 episodes are choc full of flashbacks, dreams, jumping storyline's.These should be used as rarely as possible and only to explain something or actually speed up the plot, but in Picard, so far, it's the reverse, it's dreams and flashbacks interrupted by the actual show.So much promise weighed down by writers attempting to make deep political points and cultural standpoints, please just give us some snappy dialogue that actually goes somewhere and based in the 'now'.It is fascinating actually that writers and directors cannot see this for themselves as they get lost in trying to impress the viewer with their high moral platforms and wise outlooks on life, in this they have forgotten to use the characters and high production values to actually entertain.","rating":"7\/10","date":"16 February 2020"}

{"title":"Picard without the Enterprise makes for a lonely trip","review":"Having recently binged all original episodes of STNG, I was looking forward to this as a continuation of the taut dialog, artful pacing and ensemble excellence of the cast that distinguished that series. However, ST:P takes Picard out of his element and places him in a hostile environment of a too-talky script, bland casting choices and dark sets, erasing the brilliant light of the original series. Creator Chabon seems to be the culprit, using endless exposition and dull dialog to bog down this 10-episode series that could have been tightly wrapped up in three.It doesn't help that Patrick Stewart's once commanding voice sounds like a whisper throughout this all-too-lengthy wheeze of a series. Saying that, I can't wait for the second year of the series: Patrick Stewart created an indelible character, but he really does need the Enterprise to carry this series to the greatness it deserves.(Not all eps are talky, dull exercises: STNG alumni Frakes directs eps 4 and 5 and those two stand head and shoulders above the rest, with jokes timed perfectly for once and pacing is tauter than the others.)","rating":"7\/10","date":"16 August 2021"}
{"title":"Star Trek Corrupted","review":"When Gene Roddenberry created ST, it was with a sense of optimism and a profound belief in the power of people, whatever their planet of origin. This was encapsulated by the concepts of the Federation and the desire of people to expand our knowledge and understanding of ourselves and the universe around us. The original series reflected and recognised the social problems of the time and looked forward to when we were bigger than these issues by being better.ST: Picard is set in a slow, depressing and down beat galaxy (how did that happen?!?), the main protagonists, including Picard, are self absorbed, self serving and self centred. Gone is the ambition to make the world(s) a better place. They are operating in a cess pool of greed and corruption and appear to be very comfortable in that environment.I started watching ST TOS in the '70s, having enjoyed ALL the various iterations to varying degrees (yes, Discovery too). This however, is not Star Trek and after trying to find some redeeming feature in any of the 5 episodes aired so far, I'm giving up on it.","rating":"4\/10","date":"24 February 2020"}
{"title":"Welcome back Picard!","review":"First to address the negative reviews, most of them were written before the show started which is ridiculous that IMDB let's you do that. It's also equally ridiculous that some people were determined to hate it no matter what. Ive seen alot of \"this is not TNG this is disgrace!\" Yeah exactly it's not called ST TNG Returns its Picard! Last week people all over the internet freaked out when Stewart said that this is no longer the Next Generation. Yeah that's right things change even in shows about the future. Than there's the complaining that its serialized and not stand alone episodes, again its not TNG. Someone on here even complained that Stewart is even in this at 80 years old, I'm sorry but WTF? And than the person who complained about there being a strong woman in the show, like really your upset about a young woman with some things that are special about her is stronger and faster than an 80 year old man? Lol dont worry dude in the promo for the rest of the season you see Picard about to do a sword fight and he uses a phase gun of some sort so dont count the man out yet.Anyway right from the start you could see that they spared no expense on this show. The sets, the costumes and the CG were top notch. Stewart slipped back into the role of Picard like putting on a glove. The action scenes were done really well and seeing Patrick and Brent onscreen together again brought a tear to my eye as TNG was a big part of my childhood. I am so grateful that Stewart and everyone else made this show. I'd say the only negative thing was the opening theme song, it wasnt horrible, way better than Enterprise's, but I won't be humming it to myself anytime soon.","rating":"9\/10","date":"23 January 2020"}
{"title":"Better than expected after all the negative reporting.","review":"Ya, I have to say I really enjoyed the first episode. It was interesting to see a new side of future earth. There was so many small things linking Picard back to STTNG, and the last movie. It had a lot of great action. Picard acted his age. He runs out of breath going up stairs. He's ducking for cover and not fighting himself. The vault was interesting, something to pause on and take a second look at what you may have missed the first time. Having a couple Romulan's showing emotion unlike a Vulcan. It's a new perspective.Is it perfect, no. But it's a strong showing for a first episode. Generally fir Star Trek, the first season is a little ruff. I think they got over this hump pretty quickly because everyone knows who Picard is. Same with others like Data who makes a appearance in a Dream of Picard along with Enterprise-D. It was just a amazing scene I didn't think we would ever see again, let alone in 2020.It was a much better start for Picard over Discovery. Discovery's first year wasn't the best, but the second season was actually pretty good and also had a number of things linking it to the original series. So I can't wait for the 3rd season. Until then, I'm going to Enjoy Picard and hope it only gets even better. I still think they are greatly limiting it's viewers not having it on their normal channel in Prime Time.","rating":"9\/10","date":"25 January 2020"}

And I don't like Shaw and I'm wondering why he would ever make captain since he seems like a coward. I'm a little surprised at Seven as she never has seemed to be this type of person.Jack Crusher is awesome. The bravery, the sass, all of it. It's so incredibly refreshing.

It feels fresh yet has the familiarity of a comfort blanket.The sound is the problem.\nAnd it needs to be fixed for season 2.\nI watch all kinds of TV shows, some of which have action and loud sound. When watching a TV series or a movie I generally don't have to lower the sound for the action scenes and then turn it back up to hear the dialogue. Normally I wouldn't even notice if I need to change the sound occasionally while watching a show. But in season 1 of Picard I am having to change it Every Single Time it goes from dialogue to action and vice versa, so that it has become a full time job. I've grown increasingly unhappy so much so that I've hit the pause button in the middle of the penultimate episode of season 1 to write this review.","rating":"7\/10","date":"30 June 2020"}
{"title":"I don't understand the hate for this show???","review":"I have never written a review on IMDb before so I'm happy that this is my first review on here.Everyone's got their own opinions for the show and I think that's all fine. Star Trek it's about excepting differences and being different. The show makes people want to think about exploring into the unknown. I think any sort of Star Trek fan might like the show or dislike the show. And I think if anybody is thinking about watching the show but is discouraged because of the reviews, I think you should watch the show for yourself to see if you like it or dislike it. Slight spoilers ahead. I want you to enjoy it for yourself.Many people have been frustrated about the show because it isn't like the Star Trek that everybody is used to. The Star Trek universe is usually about trekking into the unknown to find new planets and new civilization.And I understand that this show isn't exactly about finding all that, but I think that's a good thing. If the Star Trek universe continued to expand on the universe they'd have to create new aliens that we may never have heard of. Which I'm OK with.I've been a fan of science-fiction since I was 11 years old. It was actually Star Trek the Next Generation that got me to love sci-fi. So when I first saw Star Trek Picard it made me feel like a little kid again.Seeing Picard, Data, Riker, & Deanna Troi again made me feel so happy. I never watched Voyager but I recognized seven of nine and I was really happy to see Hugh again. I remember being young and watching the Borg, Romulans, Klingons, Vulcans, and more Aliens thinking how big the Star Trek universe could be. I am a fan of the TOS, TNG, The original movies, and the new ones which is called the Kelvin timeline.I honestly love this tv show and I cannot wait for season two. If I know anything about Star Trek, I know Q is going to be in this to bother Picard and I really want to see that.I give this show a 10\/10. This is my personal opinion. I hope whoever reads this enjoys the show.Live Long & Prosper. \u00f0\u0178\u2013\u2013","rating":"10\/10","date":"19 June 2021"}

Although I was skeptical at first, and wouldn't have watched it if my partner (who had already watched it) convinced me to, I gave it a chance because I am a Next Generation fan. I was pleasantly surprised. Intriguing plot, characters mostly well done (though I was a little annoyed by Dr. Agnes Girardi). As with any Star Trek episode, there are many moments of \"how did they do that?\" - things that do not make logical sense without further explanation. I guess you could say that about a lot of sci-fi. Lots of \"willing suspension of disbelief.\" And I was a little annoyed that they magically duplicated Picard at the end, making all that \"grieving\" unnecessary. But overall, very well done and held my attention throughout.","rating":"10\/10","date":"12 April 2021"}
{"title":"It's ok but a bit disappointed so far","review":"I watched the first episode last night and it was OK...it is, after all, Patrick Stewart as Jean-Luc Picard but I can't pretend I wasn't disappointed by the tone. TNG was always quite happy and life affirming whereas this seemed quite sombre and depressing.One of the things I used to love about Star Trek and particularly TNG was that each episode was a self-contained story with its own plot and sub-plot that were neatly tied up at the end. This meant you could watch and enjoy any single episode (apart from those that were clearly two parters) on its own and you didn't need to know what had happened before. On initial viewing it looks like Picard has moved away from this to a Westworld style continuing thread where you have to watch the entire series in the hope that it all makes sense at the end. I've become a bit weary of this approach. To me that seems a shame but I'm pretty sure I'll watch it to the end.","rating":"6\/10","date":"25 January 2020"}

{"title":"Excellent season with only a few missfires","review":"After a very strong start and a generally well paced story arc I was extremely satisfied with season 1 as a whole.There were occasional less than stellar episodes; but this does little to offset the general strength of the show. I'm very much looking forward to season 2.Unfortunately, it seems that the self appointed 'guardians of 'true' star trek' are once again out in force; finding every fault possible In the show because it didnt match whatever head cannon they expected to see.Picard has room for improvement yes; but the guardians always seem to forget that TNG, DS9, VOY & ENT all had a dodgy first couple of seasons too.\"Boldly sitting where no one has sat before\" was a common criticism of DS9. \"Lost (The magic)\" was a chief criticism of early seasons of VOY...and the beloved TNG only found it's best seasons when Gene Roddenberry released his girp on the wheel enough to allow some conflict driven storytelling.Moving from the utopian society that was Roddenberrys vision, to a more fractured and flawed federation seems to be a common theme for complaint...Except for there is nothing new there, it's just more apparent. The guardians seem to forget Starfleet dropped its morals in TNG's The Measure of a Man. Not to mention undertaking witchunts in The Drumhead, plotting assassinations in ST:VI, declaring Martial Law in DS9: Paradise Lost, breaking treats in The Pegasus, starting a war under false pretenses In The Pale Moonlight and straight up committing genocide with Section 31....but no, Picard is too dark. The collapse of one out of 4 or 5 major stellar powers and an attack on Mars wouldn't destabilise a region now would it?It would; and there is literally nothing surprising about the fact it did.Complaints about the story arc driven series as opposed to the serialized self contain episode format are ridiculous...that's just the way TV works right now.DS9 had self contained episodes but entire seasons of story arcs. The Dominion War was a 3 season story arc FFS. VOY had a 7 season story arc all about getting home...give the hate a rest.","rating":"","date":"28 March 2020"}
{"title":"This will never please everyone","review":"This is based only on episode 1\nAfter watching ep1 from my point of view the jury out on this one. This could go one of two ways it will either grab the Star Trek fanboys or it will drop into a black hole and receive nothing but critical reviews. Overall it was nothing we have not seen before the pilot plot was nothing unique it moved along at reasonable pace the fight scenes were well choreographed and executed with style. Patrick Stewart has unfortunately aged greatly but for a man who is 80 he still delivers Picard with all the bells and whistles. The rest of the cast move through there lines and no one really stands out from the crowd. The one interesting premise was the end but you need to watch it to see what I mean. Overall not the best I have watched but far from the worst.","rating":"7\/10","date":"24 January 2020"}
{"title":"Excellent. It's a reality check.","review":"This is exactly the direction Star Trek needs to go. Star Trek has always been written to reflect real life issues. Real life isn't all sunshine, lollipops and rainbows; life in the federation would be no different. All the people saying \"Star Trek is about hope... exploration...\" etc. are forgetting this. Just like in real life, they'll be dark periods where wars and conflicts, both internal and external, are taking place, which are unavoidable even in a semi-utopian society.One episode in and I can already tell it's building into something great. The callbacks to the previous series' and movies are cleverly interspersed into the new narrative. The perfect continuation of the Star Trek timeline. We've already seen Picard's dismay with some Federation ideals in Insurrection. Coupled with the tragedies in Nemesis, equate to a story that's exactly where it needs to be in a post-Dominion war, post-Hobus supernova Federation.","rating":"10\/10","date":"25 January 2020"}
{"title":"Decent start. Its not TNG but why should it be?","review":"It's been two episodes people. I'm dying over all the grumpy reviewers that are upset it's not the same Picard, same TNG... It's 2020. If you want more TNG, rewatch the series. I do every so often and love it.At least watch a few episodes before deciding it's crap. Not wild myself about it but I'm definitely in for the ride.Anyway, a new series SHOULD be different. Review it on its own, try to avoid comparisons. As for me, I do feel it's missing some element of grandeur. Also, the Romulans were never that exciting to me. I was hoping for the Borg to be the main antagonists.At least give us something about them. Voyager's return should've made waves and scared the Federation. That the federation has shifted in its outlook and philosophy is fine by me (stuff changes guys!) but I'd loved to have seen that connected to the fear of the Borg or something more concrete. We still, I think, haven't gotten the actual reason they argued against saving the Romulans. The Borg may still show up considering the cube. Also, Seven is one of the most amazing characters in Star Trek and I would've loved to see her back properly And tightly tied to the story and not just as a cameo. We'll see.Not wild about the casting of the daughter. There are surely many more interesting actors that could've given that character some real weight.Otherwise, I can't complain. I'd rather have a decent ST-series than nothing at all. These 1\/10-reviewers apparently do not think so and are happy to go without. I guess fine by me as long as they keep it coming for those that enjoy it even if there is room for improvement.Give it a go and watch it. And judge it more after the first season.","rating":"7\/10","date":"30 January 2020"}
{"title":"Picard assassinated in season 2","review":"Picard season 2 Season 2 begins without calling for season one. Did we forget that, or do the new owners just have something more to their liking? The series starts in France, where Picard is breeding wines like an idiot, exposing the vine bottles to the sun. When the script is written by uneducated people, that's what you get... Afterward, we see him as a young boy with a Basque beret. To complete the caricature, he lacks a baguette under his arm. The French don't wear Basque berets since the 30s, but the stupid scriptwriters had to find pictures on the internet to see what a Frenchman looks like. It's slow, it doesn't move at a sci-fi pace. We left the series in the hands of a failed artist who thinks he's doing melodrama? Twenty minutes have passed since the beginning. And to say what: NOTHING. Nothing but nonsensical chatter that ends with a parody of a speech at the Academy... Episode 2 has more movement and seems to go somewhere to understand that Q, with an incomprehensible speech, enters the scene to give a lesson to Picard! Why him? We don't know because Q's speech is gibberish... Episode 3 is even more confusing. The bad writers seem to discover the upcoming scenes on the fly. Even Picard and 7-of-9 don't know where they are any more. Classic conflict situations with the team doubting while Picard seems defeated and accepting a fate in the hands of the Borg Queen. They are led by the Queen to 2024. Why? You don't want to ask those kinds of questions, apparently. The writers are improvising with patches from other Star Trek series. One wonders if the script is written by AI putting together cuts from old episodes? Before, this kind of story was done for one episode, while here the background is diluted over several episodes. It's boring and sometimes caricatural. When the goal is only commercial, Gene Roddenberry must be turning in his grave. The son does not make the weight. The nature sometimes rests...","rating":"2\/10","date":"24 June 2022"}

From my point of view, it has perfectly captured the essence of the saga, making room for it in the presentation of a more realistic futuristic world.I still love TOS, but it's hard to see nowadays, TNG is getting older..., so this new look makes perfect sense. (Though I still keep on watching the old series continuously...). In fact at first I rejected TNG after spending years watching TOS, Kirk was my captain... but Picard made me change my mind, so I could not see again TOS in the same way. Now we experience the same, the evolution, but I'm accepting this perfectly naturally. We have the chance to take advantage of this perfectly shaped character called Picard.Thanks for the production, the first episode has touched me, perfect.","rating":"10\/10","date":"25 January 2020"}
{"title":"Nice","review":"Only one episode in and it's already better than STD. This is not from the POV of a Star Ship captain.\nSome people might not like that because it will change things like they were in TNG.\nBut this isn't 'captain' Picard. This is just Jean Luc. On a mission to...well...whatever.From DS9 we know that organized crime is very much a thing in Star Trek. Orion syndicate anyone?\nThe Ferengi aren't above blackmarket deals as long as it turns a profit.TNG was always very clean. That might be true aboard a ship. But there's a whole galaxy outside of this ship. And the galaxy isn't a nice place.\nPicard not being Starfleet will probably also mean we will get to see the galaxies seething underbelly which is all but absent aboard a Starfleet vessel.Anyway, I like it so far.\nMake it so.","rating":"10\/10","date":"25 January 2020"}

{"title":"Closure","review":"I have loved Star Trek, all Star Trek, since a little kid as something I watched with my dad. I am especially attached to The Next Generation. Tonight marked the end of season one of the revival bringing back Patrick Stewart as Picard.Since a cliffhanger in the final motion picture of the Next Generation franchise in 2002, tonight's finale brought closure to a friendship that spanned 7 seasons and many motion pictures. A friendship that defined being a role model, mentor, teacher, and father. A friendship I now understand more hopefully being all of those things. It was a moment I didn't get with my father but I can only hope this is how it would have felt.Never before has a work of fiction, a tv show, art, moved me in such a way. While the series has its critics and trekkies who are critical of how it ended, I hope the moment was not unique to me.In a day where tv, movies, and the real world has everyone frustrated, this gives me hope that there is \"art\" that will immortalize the feeling of friendship.While critics and fans alike will criticize and pick apart the show as a whole, it accomplished in part what I hoped to see.","rating":"10\/10","date":"27 March 2020"}

{"title":"The Golden Girls....","review":".....in space. Like most of the Star Trek spin offs this is more space opera with a cast that looks like it left the retirement home. Lots of talking, dark, grim, lots of reminiscing and short on action. If you want Star Trek watch The Orville. Picard, like most of the recent iterations of Star Trek, would have put Gene Roddenberry to sleep. Roddenberry challenged the imagination of audiences decades ago, even on restrictive network television, to see a future that worked, while exploring timeless moral dilemmas and conflict through adventure. Picard, on the other hand, is like a night time soap opera with multiple personal dramas unfolding in which the imaginative technology and adventure are just a back drop for personal drama. And frankly an 82 year old running around in space with his previous crew mates that are almost as elderly is simply not believable on any level, but especially not in what is purported to be adventure science fiction. Again, if you want Star Trek adventure and story lines without all the \"space opera\" watch The Orville on Hulu or Disney. They nailed it. Picard, like most of the other siblings of Star Trek, has gone way off course and the future, like the sets, is dim.","rating":"2\/10","date":"17 February 2023"}

{"title":"It is decent enough, but not so great that I didn't switch to the Office.","review":"Here's my thing. I love Star Trek: The Next Generation the series. I admired the Original Series although it came out before I was born, I was able to get into it. For the other shows, I caught a few episodes here and there and I thought they were usually above average for quality, but they never grabbed my attention the same way.This is because I don't care about Star Trek. I may think I do, but really I care about what it delivers. In the reboot movies it seemed like all the philosophy, morals, and trippy psychological premises were thrown out for good old fashioned star wars action (not to mention that Kronos was a 24 hour trip from Earth unless you just want to teleport there, but that's another story). I love Star Wars action, but I also like all the other stuff which you don't see as much of in shows and movies, especially these days.When the new Picard show was announced, it was so hyped and shoved in my face that I immediately started thinking that it must suck because lately all the good movies and shows I end up seeing by accident and know nothing about them first. But they hammered home the faithful links to nostalgia that I have now been trained to interpret as hints that the movie is just going to ruin everything for everyone.When I finally watched Picard with the notion it would most likely suck I was surprised to find that it did fit well into the universe and that it did continue the timeline. But I stopped watching anyway because I did not really care about what was happening. I actually liked the swearing because I always felt like Picard must really piss off his superiors sometimes and it wasn't too frequent, but I felt like I was watching an uninspired murder mystery set in an uninspired Sci-fi world created by really talented people who did the best they could with the orders they were given with updated visuals and politics that were more acknowledged than really absorbed into a meaningful story.I thought the acting was top notch and the deadpan style worked okay, and I was so tired of the show before I even watched the first episode that there was nothing in there to surprise me and turn the frown upsidedown.","rating":"6\/10","date":"26 June 2020"}

{"title":"A different approach to a well-known and worn-out formula...and why not?","review":"I really don't understand why some people are so resistant to the notion of \"change\"...Star Trek, this marvellous universe created by Gene Rodenberry, allready brought us over the years, the same \"formula\" applied in different ages and scenarios. Since the original series in the 60's to the new generatios from the 80' and 90's, all the diffrent spin-offs had that same \"feeling\" stamped on...\"the universe it's a wonderfull place and we all gonna, eventually, live happily in peace\".It's a positive message, we all in our youth had a fascination for that kind of ideal of a peaceful interstellar way of life, but things change, people and ideas get old and new concepts come alive.With the new movies and the new series that have been released in these last years. we've been assisting to a different approach to a well-known and worn-out formula...and why not? Romulans, (ex)Borgs and Synthetics seem to be a good starting point for this series, don't you agree?Star Trek: Pickard, I admit, it's been slow-paced (so far), has some incoerences regarding time (stelar dates that don't match and new timelines), and specially it includes one of the most misterious races in the Star Trek universe, the Romulans. (I wonder how some some people would react if the series theme was the Romulan Wars, would they still complaint about violence anf f-bombs?)The 3rd episode just aired and the complaints and the angry speeches allready went too far in my opinion, give the show a chance folks!! I was born in the early 70's, grew up in the 80's and I always watched all the new movies and new series with interest and without any prejudice, exactly as I did this time also.There are people giving 1,2 or 3 stars out of 10 with arguments dificult to understand (specially because 80% of them weren' even born when Star Trek was in it's peak). So I just wanna ask to everyone to be a little more comprehensive and try to understand that new ideas and new concepts will always appear and change over the years, for those that really can't change they're opinions...just don't watch so you don't have to bother to write offensive texts.In my oppinion, it's way too soon to form a clear and final decision regarding the series rating but due to the producing quality, inovotate approach, good SFX and a good attempt to disclosure further more the misterious Romulans, ill give it a solid 6 out of 10 so far.","rating":"7\/10","date":"9 February 2020"}

{"title":"Not TNG, not sold on it either","review":"ST:P has cinematic qualities visually, an intriguing cast and a story which clearly needs to be fleshed out before a true judgement can be made on it. The seeds are there to have a wonderful plot. That we know 7 of 9 and Hugh are returning adds intrigue. I'm not convinced the return of the Riker's will add anything but nostalgia, but I hope to be wrong. I'm happy to see that the 80 year old namesake isn't portrayed as an action hero like he was 20+ years ago in First Contact, and that he's been allowed to age like Patrick Stewart has.That said, Picard survived a big explosion without a scratch while others mere feet from him were incinerated, then was up and about the next day, and that kind of thing bothers me. Where as Discovery brings viewers relentless stress by ramping up the action episode to episode, Picard is far more methodical, telling them story at an almost Motion Picture pace. TMP was fantastic in its own way, but it wasn't episodic and divided into 10 parts over 10 weeks. Picard is, and may suffer for it. I wish there was a balance that could be struck between the two.One question that I can't help but ask the Star Trek EU runners: why can't there be a joy or positivity to our heroes and stories in Star Trek anymore? TOS and TNG had opening fanfare, even using trumpets to boost excitement like a college fight song. Discovery and Picard have mellow, boarder line depressing themes. Picard, the character, is obviously affected by the events preceding the series. As someone who has authority to determine what those events were, I wish the show runners would see what we liked about those characters and stories. It wasn't simply that the idealism, it was the joy they had in fighting for them. It was that they could make peace with the Klingons, a warrior species that couldn't be more opposite from the Federation, and be respectful of their culture without ruthlessly trying to change it. Something that I respected about Reagan was that he was a happy warrior, and regardless of how I viewed his policy choices, I must admit that quality is something that I admire. Good people can disagree on matters of substance without the other side being denounced as evils. That's why you can like a Worf or Martock and aAlex Kurtzman was also a co-writer of the 2009 movie, and there is an obvious tie-in between the two with the destruction of Romulus via supernova. Does there also need to be an attack on Mars to have yet another 9\/11 allegory? Obviously terrorism, racism, sexism, ism-ism's aren't issues solved by society as of 2020, and likely won't be in the next couple of years. I don't think this requires a metaphorical social justice shovel to be used to beat viewers over the head with. There's something to be said for subtlety, and that's not what this production\/writing team excels at.This world needs the Star Trek that is positive, aspirational, and appealing. I sincerely hope that this show begins to steer that direction.","rating":"6\/10","date":"26 January 2020"}

But then in the last 5-10 minutes they undid all that decent work by plastering on a \"Hollywood\" ending. So sappy! Let see: boy gets girl (and son), girl gets girl, girl (who got other girl) gets dead boy (from previous timeline), main boy gets girl, and finally, Q declares his love of Picard and dies happily - jeeezus! Wish I could sit in a room with that team of screenwriters and ask them, \"WTF!\"Major disappointment, and if Patrick Steward and Jeri Ryan weren't in it, I would boycott season 2, like I have the Discovery series due to Michael Burnham's excessive and predictable emotional affectations.","rating":"7\/10","date":"13 May 2022"}

Now it is populated by people like the guy standing in line to a movie theater line with his girlfriend in Annie Hall (1977), standing one step ahead of Woody Allen and Diane Keaton talking intellectual rubbish to his girlfriend. That's when Woody brought out the writer whose work that guy was dissecting, to tell him that he has no idea what he is talking about.A review that dares to praise Star Trek Picard gets attacked by the \"not helpful\" clicks. Yet the rating of the series by users here is an overwhelming \"10\" (what gives?).And it should be so. Star Trek Picard is a solid \"10\" in an age when we could not have moved further away from the ideals Gene Roddenberry gifted us. Picard is serious, introspective, funny, respectful, ingenious, entertaining and thought-provoking. Yes it does have all of today's unacceptable traits of actual quality. So feel free to register many avatars so you can click many times to tell me that my review was not helpful to you. Star Trek Picard could not be a more fitting tribute and renaissance of Star Trek. Please, powers that be, scrap that Discovery BS and keep renewing Picard for as long as Patrick Stewart lives.Now, the original review I wrote after the first episode.We waited... 9,376 days since the last episode of The Next Generation Series aired on 5\/23\/1994 and 6,254 days since Nemesis beamed to theaters in 2002. We bid Farewell to Deep Space Nine on 6\/2\/1999 and Voyager made it home on 5\/23\/2001. We endured Enterprise. Another timeline came to change everything we knew, but Kelvin is now all but lost in time. We finally abandoned all hope when served with the total BS of Discovery. Then, Jean-Luc Picard felt he was being dispatched from retirement to save the Alpha Quadrant, again, and we wondered: who dispatched him? Was it Harry Mudd playing another joke on us, or could it be that Gene himself came to Jean-Luc in his sleep with one last mission, to save the legacy of Gene Rodenberry's visionary \"Wagon Train to the Stars\" and redeem his perception of what humanity could be? We waited for the first episode on 1\/23\/2020 to find out. Would the show-runners serve another dose of failure to respect the concept, or would they come through?I wore my magnetic metal communicator (TNG version) on my sweatshirt and switched on the screen. They did come through for us. They came through more brilliantly than I could have hoped. From the first seconds of the first episode you know this is serious Star Trek. With deep and subtle connections and a sense of humor but also a sense of duty to revive the wonder that was all but gone with the solar winds.Star Trek Picard starts out as Star Trek at its very best. The first episode served only to set the stage and the road map for what is to follow. The mission is taking shape. How ingenious the plot devices are, yet respectful to both the legacy and to our intelligence. Fascinating, as an old friend would say. Soon it will be time to engage.","rating":"10\/10","date":"23 January 2020"}

I'm not saying it's perfect, it's a bit slow and maybe the language is just too harsh sometimes, it can be disturbing but so far I really really liked it, I was also fascinated by the new plot about transhumanism.I think the series just too advanced for common viewers, you have to know what you're looking at, it's not for everyone, only for advanced thinkers who see the danger of transhumanism...I was waiting more from the ST community, lol.Try it again in ten years, then you may understand what \"Picard\" is about.","rating":"7\/10","date":"19 June 2020"}
{"title":"Good","review":"This is not your typical Star Trek show but that's one reason it's entertaining. In season 7 of Star Trek TNG there was a two part episode called Gambit where Picard basically goes undercover and leaves Star Fleet. This show is like that, Picard on his own trying to make the best of a bad situation. The story takes awhile to develop but as the show goes on things become clearer and you really get to know the characters, which is more than I can say for Discovery. I really enjoyed this show despite some plot holes. Fans of TNG will enjoy seeing classic Picard back in the action as well as some classic characters from TNG. It took awhile to get to know the characters but as you do you will likely like them and see they have some depth. Patrick Stewart does a great job as always and I enjoyed this show better than TNG and any of the TNG movies. I don't understand the poor reviews other than this is different and people don't like change. Some issues will come to light as the story develops and I think Roddenberry would be happy with this show. Despite not being your paint by the numbers script on a Star ship this show tackles some issues and mainly allows us to go on a journey while the characters around us develop and become people we care about. Be patient with it, give it time, and don't expect it to be anything and you'll enjoy it.","rating":"8\/10","date":"14 July 2020"}

{"title":"How to destroy a Star Trek show in 4 episodes","review":"I wanted to like this, I tried for 4 episodes now. It is just not developing properly, and it feels like CBS went really cheap on us.Writing, dialogue and character development are all shallow and superficial. Production quality looks cheap.The departure from Star Trek in general is just huge without a strong justification.\nThey make Jean-Luc come across as even older than he is. In fact they diminished him so much that it is almost insulting and they keep creating opportunities to remind us that he is too old for this. This I find weird, detrimental to the show and completely unnecessary.4 episodes of what amounts to a setup and the season has 10. They surely took their time. We are pretty much half way through and very little has developed.The ship, and the crew are just awful, deprived of almost all of the Star Trek feel. The Expanse's Rocinante is a better, more exiting ship with a soul, character and a heck of a story to tell. If you want a real ragtag crew\/ship, that's where you'll find it. Not in this sorry attempt to tell a different Star Trek story.The character dynamics in Picard suffer from something I've seen in too many shows that did not last long: extreme individualism, lack of compassion, selfishness, cynicism and mistrust. They are all in as a part of some deal, but what we really crave in drama is love, compassion, sacrifice and selflessness. Discovery injected these virtues into Star Trek correctly and artfully. Picard so far failed completely at this and created an emotional void that only amplifies other problems.The Federation resembles the Roman empire just before the collapse. They are infiltrated and run by all kinds of agenda with no real structure, mechanism -- and the will really -- to self-correct. Suddenly, in the 24th century after centuries of progress I am to believe that humans reverted to circa 2015, vaping, swearing, bickering and engaging in egoistic back-and-forth.And before you give me the Kurtzman explanation for swearing, that's a prepared BS response to criticism which they expected. While it may be true that sweating was not a legal option in the early days of broadcast TV, Star Trek fans did come to understand it as a feature of the imagined better humanity, as symbolic as it is. They should have known this. Discovery used it sparingly and smartly. They knew the risks and they packaged it masterfully. This now is in your face -- \"because I can,\" probably even hoping to create controversy and social media discussion.The sense of awe and wonder is gone. Boundaries are not being pushed, human spirit is not being tested and challenged. Melancholy has set in and everyone seems riveted by grudges and ego.At times it feels like Jean-Luc is in a different sci-fi, an alien himself, struggling to fit into the writing of whatever this is, diminished to an almost miserable old man.","rating":"2\/10","date":"15 February 2020"}
{"title":"They went full nostalgia","review":"I didn't watch the first two seasons. Only the pilot episode and I was out. I guess I'm one of those \"not-my-Trek\" types not loving all the new Star Trek stuff. I was content just watching Angry Joe reviews.Season 3 brought me back! But they know what they're doing. They hit you with the nostalgia from the beginning. The first two episodes have the same feel as the original Star Trek movies where the characters know they're old and joke about it, but there's still the awe of being in space that Star Trek always provided, the camaraderie of the actors, and the fantastic Jerry Goldsmith music from \"First Contact\"!!And not to say nostalgia is the only thing it has going for it. The undercover character and her drug abuse issues is compelling enough. I know she had a fall from grace and it's always cathartic to watch a character recover. If she does so with the help of a certain beloved Klignon, even better!The seedy city stuff may not feel like Trek, but, realistically, places like this would exist. So watching people smoking death sticks in a place that looks like a back alley on Coruscant or a main street off Blade Runner is okay with me.And Seven of Nine is there to remind us how she stole the show in Star Trek Voyager. I know she was in an other season, but I don't plan to watch those. She's perfect here as the uncomfortable first officer.I'm just glad this season has the feeling of being made by people who appreciate Star Trek and not by people who hate it, don't get it, or want to deconstruct it. Time will tell, though.I may change my rating as the series continues, but so far, it's hitting the right notes. Nostalgia-wise, at least.","rating":"9\/10","date":"27 February 2023"}

Is it as good as DS9, Voyager or TNG...... no, and gone are the days of 22-24 episode seasons. But this was definitely an improvement on Discovery and was closer to being back to \"proper Star Trek\".The characters were good and so was the storyline and although Patrick Stewart is really showing his age now, you always get a great performance from him.It was nice to see some of the other TNG crew as well as other familiar faces. There was also enough nods to the TNG series to make it feel nostalgic and bring it closer to the Trek we all know and love.As good as the older Star Trek series....... no. But a good series all the same and definitely worth a watch.","rating":"7\/10","date":"10 June 2020"}
{"title":"Lot's of nostalgia. Slow at times, but very enjoyable nonetheless","review":"For those wondering whether this is like Star Trek Next Generation, Voyager or DS9 then I can answer shortly. No, this show is not like that. I myself was actually not expecting anything like that after all the things that have been produced after Voyager.I see lot's of negative reviews and from that perspective I can understand the disappointment, but not calling it star trek because it isn't a 50 minute space soap opera setup like the older series is lying to yourself.It is true that this series doesn't follow the same routine. And I do miss that, but it does follow Star Trek principles across the board. Friendship, Danger, Sacrifice, showing strength and weakness. All boxes are ticked and the atmosphere is so much more Star Trek than anything I have seen in recent years it was a very nice experience to glimpse into the past.\nThe show is more of a homage to the Star Trek of old rather than trying to replicate it. Lots of old faces coming back.I thouroughly enjoyed it. Could it have been better? Yes. could the story have been a little bit less Mass Effect? Yes most definitely. Was it bad? Absolutely not. In truth Star Trek was never about telling an amazing story, it was about people and overcoming obstacles together. Reading other reviews I feel that people seem to have forgotten what Star Trek was about.Remember this. When Star Trek Next Generation came out it was actually pretty bad. People hated it. Fans hated it. It was the same for Voyager. People hated it with all their might because it was different from Next Generation. It wasn't actually doing too well before 7 of 9 came on set. Right now many of those same people are glorifying all these series and start hating on the next best thing. I will not defend Enterprise or Discovery as those weren't my cup of tea, plus what bothered more most about those series is that they actively broke down the canon that was laid there before those series.I can promise you that whatever flaw you find in Picard, it is true to canon and follows the characters exactly how they were before. Is the show different? Is the pacing different? Yes. You can decide for yourself if that is something that matters to you. to me, being true to the original works was more important. And it delivers just that.","rating":"8\/10","date":"7 April 2020"}
{"title":"Promising New Star Trek Series","review":"Good start for the new series as first episode was very promising. 2nd episode was not as good and not as promising but it's still early to form a complete opinion. Depending on the writing and the development, this show can be great or can sink alongside with the discovery ship, if writers choose to follow that path and connect it somehow to discovery, in order to redeem for the later a bit. (worst case scenario)\nIn technical details the music is good, the vfx good, the acting good, some camera blue lights and rapid movemement are not good. Plot has some holes and some new things remaining to see the patching in the following episodes.\nOverall so far is worth watching.\nEnjoy","rating":"7\/10","date":"31 January 2020"}
{"title":"Not my Picard","review":"I could only make it halfway through the first season. This is an obvious money grab by all involved.

Truly, a dream in the sense that when you dream of a movie or TV show franchise you love, it's different, yet resonates with emotional familiarity. This is not a show that retreads the same ground or tries to be a nostalgia-fest, this is evolved, transcendent, exactly where things should be after several decades have passed. It's been the best television experience I've had since Twin Peaks: The Return. Bringing Michael Chabon on board, in addition to the other fabulous creative team, was a key move in the playbook to crafting an unforgettable, masterpiece of a season. Thank you to all those involved.","rating":"","date":"8 April 2020"}

And, honestly, Jeri Ryan is amazingly hot twenty years after Voyager.Yeah, it's not formulaic \"Star Trek,\" but it's actually decent entertainment if you can let go of that concept. If you're trying to relive TNG, DS:9, or Voyager, then go back and watch those shows, cause those days are over. They were fun while they lasted, but television has changed and so has Star Trek, even the ST movies have changed.So, like the show for what it is and let go of recapturing the Star Trek television fantasy, or just don't watch it!","rating":"7\/10","date":"6 September 2021"}
{"title":"Watch to the end before you judge if it is Star Trek!","review":"A lifelong Trek fan, I am gobsmacked by the number of people destroying this brilliant, clever and considered series in the reviews here.The theme of the discontent seems to be that this just isn't star trek - that it is dark and pessimistic and that (horror of horrors) people occasionally use swear words. Well this is partially true - there is darkness and people definitely swear, hilariously in some instances.But for those of you that watch til the end and don't give up halfway through as many seem to have, you will discover that the series is absolutely and wholly intentionally ABOUT the things that some are complaining are missing - ultimately (without spoilers) this series is all geared up around the questions of diversity, acceptance, the importance of choosing to love and not to hate, to not pre judge or use preconception, and ultimately the eternal fight of good (freedom and acceptance) over evil (judgement, condemnation and fear of the different). You literally don't get more Star Trek than that!The production values are high, it looks beautiful, the acting is first class ( a few dodgy accents from Rios and one from Picard aside!) and the story is complex and engaging - is it different from TNG? Yes, very very different - did it need to be? Of Course!It isn't 1965, or even 1985 anymore, and you can't escape that Star Trek, like everything else, needs to evolve with the rest of the world - Data's Day isn't going to cut it anymore, neither is a cutesy pastiche of a sherlock holmes ham up on a holodeck - that's just not where we are any more. Star Trek in it's own way has always addressed social commentary, and it does again here, just in a way that will suit the next generation (forgive me) of Trek Fans that will come through.If you want old Trek, try The Orville, a brilliant show with classic Sci Fi values that works because of it's homage nature and it's kitsch\/modern fusion that is handled so well by the genius Seth McFarlane, and if you really want nostalgia, well...just watch old Star Trek. But don't bemoan the lack of acceptance and diversity in this show, as you could fall into a crazy irony trap and fail to show the diversity and acceptance of a newer, different generation who live in a different world to the one we grew up in - and if you sit back and go with it, you will find out that in the end this is 100% pure Star Trek ethic, beautifully delivered. I can't wait for season 2.","rating":"10\/10","date":"28 March 2020"}
{"title":"Decent","review":"Well not as bad as a lot of the reviews I've read. Slow to get going but kept me hooked. No it wasn't trek of old but I guess It really shouldn't be. I see the direction they're aiming for and hats off for having the nerve to follow through. It has its own identity thus far in the Star Trek universe and can only get better. I also think discovery was very good an just about edges Picard to date. Hopefully many more seasons to spake a reasonable debate. How awesome would a cross over have been.","rating":"7\/10","date":"29 March 2020"}
{"title":"Series Should Be Called \"Hatred For All Things Good\"","review":"What a disgusting horrid show. It's beyond terrible. Not only is this a terrible show in an of itself, it's an assault on Star Trek and all things good in the world. This show, along with Discovery, is literally in existence in an attempt to completely destroy Star Trek. The writing is horrid beyond belief. Stupendously moronic. There is no way such a terrible show could possibly have a, current, 7.5 rating. Literally, everyone hates this show. Everyone, that is, but the ideological woke who are the brainwashed pions programmed to drool at the ring of their master's bell. Such things only exist as an affront to all cultural goodness in order to destroy every shred of it and put in its place ideological cultish propaganda. Oh, it has quite a financial budget behind it all and the usual visual quality that such money can bring to the screen, but the financial backers of such projects are not interested in creating a profit generating endeavour, no, these people already have all the money in the world and their desires are purely power driven; they look to take control and power of people through shaping societal morals, beliefs, values, and removing freedom in every way, shape, and form including, and perhaps most importantly, the various forms of entertainment which give us such pleasure as music, movies, plays, literature, comedy, dance, celebrations, sports, and so forth. Genuinely good popular TV shows, movies, and music are quite rare these days, and there's a reason for that, it's because all of our forms of entertainment are under assault, not to mention the very freedoms which we like to think are inalienable are being removed at the same time. Picard has the worst viewer ratings of all time; almost nobody is watching this show, yet, they pour millions and millions of dollars into it. The first season was so terrible and there were so few viewers I thought surely this show will be cancelled before the fist season is over, yet, no, they will make a third season. Why? Why would they make a third season of a show that is literally losing them money?? That's right, as I said, they don't care about the money, they only care about destruction. \"Star Trek: Picard lost 44% of its initial audience over the course of the show's first 10 episode season\". \"Star Trek: Picard viewership has plummeted over half a million viewers in Canada in just five episodes\". By the end of season two, there are hardly any people watching. The only people I know who are watching are those who do so in order to report back to fans on social media how it continues to dig down into the darkest depths of hatred of everything good. Don't watch this show or any other ST show beyond DS9. Go back and watch the old ones again, they're great. Or check out The Orville, season one is good, and season two is much better as they iron the show out -- made by people who hate what they're doing to ST who said, 'let's do our own show'.","rating":"1\/10","date":"11 April 2022"}

The reviewers that don't like it remind me of the hate that killed off SG universe. Some people seem to want a one episode format where we have a beginning and end in one hour, then next week a new adventure. That's what killed SG universe. Now I will never know what happened to the most hated weegie in space(Robert Carlyle). I hope this doesn't end up the same way.

{"title":"Star Trek: Picard - bad title for this show.","review":"Star Trek: Picard. That's a bad name for this series because there is little to nothing of either in the show. This is not the Star Trek that made the series great (before JJ and Kurtzman got hold of it), and it is most certainly not Picard, the diplomatic, erudite, thoughtful captain of the Enterprise. This is some dystopian version of both. How it got an 8+ rating is beyond me, unless there are a ton of paid shill reviews.This series might almost work if it was presented as a totally unrelated space opera, if it weren't so SLOW and stodgy in moving the story along. Oh, there is some \"action\", but no imagination. Even the violence... I won't say what, so as not to spoil it for those who haven't watched it, but trust me, some of it is unnecessary. Not to mention that this Star Trek is full of uncultured, foul-mouthed people. And what's up with the Romulans? They are just pointy-eyebrow, pointy-ear humans. At least they act that way.It is not even that the actors are bad. Certainly Patrick Stewart, Santiago Cabrera, Alison Pill and too many others to name are good actors. You just have to watch some of the other shows they have appeared in to know that. They just need to be given better material to work with.Has no one involved with the production even watched Star Trek (the real Star Trek series, not the JJ-Kurtzman versions). Nothing in this show reflects the forward thinking ideals presented by those. This show is all about criticizing the current state of the world and telling everyone what is wrong with it. In short, it is a show for today's 'woke' people who require everything to be done to their agenda or not at all.Personally, I am looking (mostly in vain) for shows which present a hopeful outlook on the future. Unless you are bored and have nothing else to do, I recommend you pass on this one.","rating":"2\/10","date":"18 February 2020"}

{"title":"Different in a good way","review":"Not your typical Star Trek show, but that doesn't mean it's bad. On the contrary it's a good show and a worthy continuation on the life of Jean-Luc Picard. Some scenes really gave me goosebumps, and the finale (specially the second half) was really moving. A lot of hints to the old shows that really pays off for the life long star trek fans. Some subtle, some not so subtle, but all done in a honorary way as an homage to the star trek legacy.It has some light plot holes and some logical kinks that stops it from being a perfect 10 in my book, and some of the supporting cast is a bit Meh. But all and all a great show that I can't wait for to continue. Patrick Stewart, as always, is fenomenal. Don't listen to the haters, they have probably just misunderstood the core concept of Star Trek. Gene Roddenberry would be proud of this. LLAP.","rating":"8\/10","date":"29 October 2020"}
{"title":"The only Star Trek to continue the original storylines in 20 years, intelligent with characters we know and love. Despite 4 prequels in the same period. Why would you cancel?","review":"Picard has been a great watch most especially since season 3 had an injection of direction and gravitas, presumably a group effort to revive what should be Star Trek, unlike what the last 20 years have delivered: 4 inconsequential prequels and no continuations. The people making the decision that there should be no actual Star Trek like Picard, just reboots and rehashes, are frankly vapid at best, and cretinous at worst. They were wrong to cancel Star Trek the original series and they are wrong yet again. The only Star Trek to continue the original storyline in 20 years, albeit not perfect (yet), Picard is intelligent with characters we know and love, getting better and better, with the greatest experienced actors in their role. Those who wish to cancel the only lifeline for TRUE Trek are completely for the birds... I am shocked how a world can exist where so much history, lore and talent is cancelled in favour of a flash in the pan reboot that won't last 3 years (this is called garbage that you throw away and never come back to). Come on Studios, show some maturity, products that people come back to time and time again for generations sell more in the long run, stop listening to whoever it is telling you that Picard shouldn't be done.

{"title":"Watch it and make up your own mind","review":"I've been thinking a while about writing a review on STP. As there are a lot of negative reviews and comments, I felt the need to do so because in the past, I often had to realise that reviews are subjective and preferences and expectations differ from person to person.STP is clearly not ST as you know it, it is not a TNG reloaded though it brings back some beloved characters. IMO, the many negative reviews are a direct response to the fact that STP is not easy-to-consume entertainment.\nWe accompany an aged Jean-Luc Picard on his last mission, discovering along the way the memories of his second but last mission and see him fail and fall.While STP could be considered a deconstruction of Gene Roddenberry's idealistic vision of the future, it is on the other hand an invitation to discuss some important questions:\n1. Am I obliged to offer humanitarian aid to my enemy?\n2. Is there a point beyond which technology and science should not be allowed to develop?\n3. How should we treat our heroes of yesterday?In all these questions, STP confronts Gene Roddenberry's vision with the reality of the human mind and society. It opposes morals and moral obligations with comfort and prejudice and fear. Should I do what is right, or should I take the easy way? And if the government or council or the powers that be decide to take the easy way, what are the consequences for people who wanted to do what's right? Or for the people that are left behind?STP does not look big budget, it doesn't waste money on guys like Ferengi or Klingons. We see rather ordinary people at their home, or at places that are definitely not worth holding a diplomatic reception. But it has its charms and its style and it offers what ST-TOS also had: Characters, emotions and questions. It tells its tale without giving easy answers, leaving it to the audience to think and decide themselves. From this point of view, it is Star Trek at its best.","rating":"","date":"7 May 2020"}
{"title":"More Star Trek than people are giving credit","review":"I get some of the criticism. We are at episode 5, and it seems like a small story, instead of a big story. Some of the characters seem like composite tropes, instead of real beings, like the magic Romulan Ninja warrior.I also see a lot of complaints that it is too \"PC\". I suggest that it isn't Star Trek that has changed, but the viewing public. Star Trek, even back to TOS, was inclusive and on the side of peace, trust and cultural relativity. It was 60s sexist, but, by next Generation, it promoted sexual equality.Complaints about this are like people who have been Crosby, Still and Nash fans complaining about a liberal rant in concert. That's the way they always were. It is the audience that has changed, not the messenger.It is also canon in the sense that Star Fleet migrated from a force for good in the universe to an organization of political intrigue. This is consistent with both TNG and Deep Space None (the best written Star Trek, in my opinion).So, the good:It warms me to watch such a courteous and courtly man as JL Picard. In our time, when ruthlessness is considered a virtue, Picard's humanity stands as a testament to the best in humanity.It has space ships, technology and a complex enemy. There are both good and bad Romulans. There is an explanation for behavior.The bad - Too much flare lighting, and wire-fu fighting. The Elnor character is a composite trope of every \"magic ninja\" of absolute honor and loyalty. He is a cartoon.A lot of melodrama. In the best TOS, TNG and DS9, plots were derived from daily routine, not plot driven \"special cases\".Too much plot armor. Too many victories of the few against the many.So, my assessment. So far, I rank it fourth, behind DS9, TOS, and TNG. It is certainly far superior to the disastrous Star Trek Discovery. I hope the 2nd season improves. Please remember how poorly written was the first season of TNG, and pedestrian Denise Crosby and Will Wheaton were as actors, until they migrate to the Data story arc.","rating":"7\/10","date":"7 April 2020"}

I first watched TOS in the 70's and many times since. I loved TNG and Voyager. At the start of every episode, everything is \"reset\" to normal, a great adventure arises, and by the end everything is normal again. In around 45 minutes. Yes, I know there were movies and continuation episodes and story arcs, but mostly everything was very clean and tidy and the Federation was a force for good.But Picard is different. It develops more slowly. We already know some of the characters, but times have changed and they are different now. Deeper. A bit scarred. The galaxy is darker. This new landscape drew me in very quickly!I'm 5 episodes in and loving it, every delicious drop. There are some great new characters as well as some old characters, one in particular whose appearance made my heart almost burst: she's not who she was, but I totally understand how she became what she is ;-).Please, give it a go.

Kirk on the original series was also getting old and was 60 when he made that and was running around in action scenes fighting the Klingons.\nThis series holds my interest, get off Picard's back and let it develop as a series, it can't be Star Trek -The Next Generation, at least he catches up with his former crew in this series, showing that true friends grow old together but still have the fighting spirit and there does not have to be a Galaxy Class Star ship involved.","rating":"7\/10","date":"23 March 2020"}
{"title":"This is not Star Trek","review":"This is not Star Trek. This is a dark amalgamation of Battlestar Galactica and a space soap opera. Any time a franchise like this turns from optimistic to dark, it is because they have either run out of good stories, or have succumbed to the lowest common denominator of emotional button pushing. Star Trek TNG is my all time favorite show. I like TOS and Voyager a lot. This is garbage produced by a juvenile mind. They attempt to cover up the shoddy writing with slick cinematography, good music\/score, and actors trying desperately to play \"cool\" detached villains or flawed heros, but it all falls horribly flat because the story, and methods of storytelling are abysmal. They bounce back and forth between the extremes of boring interpersonal relationship drama that I don't care about, and stupid, gratuitous laser fights that try to make up for the boring parts but only make me roll my eyes in disgust. I tried this show when it first came out, put it aside for a couple of years out of disgust, but am now trying to get back into it and am disappointed all over again. They've ruined a good thing.BTW: any time a franchise takes something that wasn't dark and brooding and tries to make it dark and brooding, whether it is the Bond franchise, Star Trek, Star Wars, you name it, they end up ruining it. It is a sign of either executives trying to take it over or directors and writers who are 2nd rate hacks.","rating":"2\/10","date":"18 February 2023"}

After that pilot, I am not certain that it does.Admittedly, Far Point Station was a mediocre pilot and we know what followed.Having been a Star Trek fan from the early 90s, I was tested to some degree in recent years. Now longing for a show finally bringing back the substance\/essence of what made Star Trek great over decades. That said, in reality it would be foolish to expect anything remotely near TNG quality.So I'll keep an open mind and watch a couple of more episodes because that's all that I can do.","rating":"6\/10","date":"24 January 2020"}
{"title":"Amazing","review":"It's impressive the amount of \"sucessful writers and producers\" giving 1 star and saying \"this is not star trek\".Star Trek Picard is beautiful, very well produced, there is a LOT of references, and sometimes It makes your hearth melt.It's all about star trek, because star trek is not about phasers and first contacts, its about our struggle to become better human beings.If you are a blind trekkie geek who only cares about warping, beaming and shielding, maybe you will get disapointed.For the rest of us, it was an amazing first season who set the standard of whats to come. The way the last episode ends makes you so happy and sure: there will be a lot of \"warping\" in the next season.Just amazing!","rating":"10\/10","date":"2 November 2020"}

I don't care about any of the other characters they have no real purpose and the story is strung together randomly. Both seasons were not good.

This series takes you on a gritty path through a comprimised Star fleet, via a somewhat burnt out frail admiral, haunted by events after Sir Patrick Stewarts last appearence as Picard.

The third and final season we just watched redeemed the entire show for us! Season three FINALLY fulfilled the dreams I had of a follow up to the original TNG. I have been telling all my friends to skip seasons one and two and sit back and enjoy Season 3. It's just too bad two seasons were wasted on bad stories. Stories Gene Roddenberry would never approve. But finally, Season 3 brought nearly the entire cast together, including Alice Krige, who played the original and best Borg Queen ever, in a real Star Trek story that is a very quick binge! Just sorry it's the last season we will get of this fine show and it's fine cast.It was seriously wonderful to watch and to see the show redeemed with the cast and crew we all loved so much! THIS should have been Season one. If you loved ST TNG, you are going to be pleasantly surprised to see the great turn around from the first two terrible seasons of Picard! Highly recommend you skip the first two seasons and watch season 3!!","rating":"10\/10","date":"20 March 2021"}
{"title":"Great concept ruined by poor acting in several lead characters","review":"Nice to see the continuation of the series. It is probably the best incarnation of all the different spin-offs over the years. Interesting storyline and love seeing the return of Q and the Both Queen. Nice to see Patrick Stewart in action though he is showing his age somewhat noticeably. The writing is better than most Star Trek series and the visuals are incredible. What brings the score down substantially is the incredibly bad acting of Allison Pill as Jurati and Michelle Hurd as Rafaella. Their over acting makes it incredibly difficult to watch. The rest of the cast is solid at least. The storyline keeps the interest from week to week strong. I wish someone would put them in the red uniform as we all know what happens to the people in the red uniforms.","rating":"6\/10","date":"8 April 2022"}

Season 1 and 2 were just bad, seemed like writers were not real fans. Season 3 was awesome. Skip season 1 & 2 and just go to 3. Save yourself time, just look up plot to 1 and 2 in Wikipedia then watch 3. I really liked 3, easter eggs were tactfully added, story felt like an TNG episode, overall I would rate season 3 a 7. Seasons 1&2 I would rate a 2 or less. It is a shame we can't rate individual seasons. I love star trek, however between the first 2 seasons and discovery there is a disconnect. They don't feel like star trek, they are something else not even considering issues with continuity that riddle Discovery. I am hopeful that star trek gets back on course. Strange new worlds, picard season 3, lower decks and even prodigy are all steps in the right direction. Here is to a more hopeful future for the franchise.","rating":"6\/10","date":"29 April 2023"}

{"title":"Could be better, could be worse","review":"Season 1 was OK at best. Picard seemed to take a backseat in a show named after him. Odd decision. Season 2 was an improvement but it was far from brilliant. It had its moments but the plot was a bit confusing.Season 2 was essentially an inferior mix of the films First Contact and The Voyage Home.It was odd seeing certain actors in the wrong time-line. For example, the doctor who created Data and Picard's Romulan companion from the future, who then appears as the Watcher in the 21st century. It made the story feel even more confusing. I summised that the Dr was an ancestor of the Dr who created Data. I'm not exactly sure why the Watcher was the same person from Picard's own timeline.However, this show had some good points. Q has always been an enjoyable character to watch. His mischievous antics are entertaining. I must say that his last scene with Picard was the highlight of both seasons. They really pulled that off. To have that lovely moment between 2 classic characters, who have been long-time adversaries, was satisfying. It's the only time though-out all these modern Trek shows where I've actually felt something for the characters. Mostly, I just want them all to fly into a supernova - particularly in Discovery.Picard and Q should have been all the sentiment we needed, but then an unnecessary Seven of Nine romantic interest appears out of nowhere and was completely unearned. Modern Trek writers and their agenda. It never ceases. Then you have Rios staying behind in the past, which was the obvious outcome from the early episodes and also utter nonsense. So, a fair amount of the character arcs were mediocre and unnececarily trying to be emotional, but it's still worth watching for Q and Picard's swansong.Season 3 update. Season 3 was probably the best of the seasons and had a pleasing ending.Overall it's a decent show - I don't think I could say it's a good show - but I'm still hoping for improvement in a third season.","rating":"7\/10","date":"5 May 2022"}
{"title":"No respect for the source material","review":"The entire problem with this show is the writers have zero respect for the source material. They treat our beloved characters with disrespect at every single chance. They have no idea what the philosophy of Star Trek was based upon, that humans have evolved and matured as a species, and that all endeavors focused on the betterment of the entire galaxy. These writers have lost sight of what it truly means to tell intelligent stories, ones that don't involve profane and immature reactions. Star Trek is set in a universe where the most wise and the most experienced use their unified skills to achieve seemingly impossible solutions. It's supposed to be, anyway. But this.. this is the most ugly and dumbed-down story that has ever had the gall to call itself Star Trek.","rating":"1\/10","date":"10 May 2022"}

The storyline requires patience and the characters have a long way to grow in those first two seasons to be believably up to the challenges of the third.As the TNG-plus family comes all together again in season three they are wiser, and more experienced. The pace of their deliberations and actions makes sense for them and gives the viewer insight into the broader perspective accompanying higher ranks.Bravo Jonathan Frakes, Patrick Stewart and all for the commitment to Star Trek and this crew.

It was really great to see seven of nine and the voyager people interacting as well. Just a really incredible stuff. The captain of the titan was amazing as well and everybody was really cool.

All I can say is this is what ST (TNG) is all about. I binged watch the entire season over 2 nights. Every episode ended as a cliff hanger. A little bit slow with character development but always balanced by plenty of suspense and action. Bravo to writers and actors. As an 'older' 60+ Star Trek fan - this was the ultimate series of them all for me. There should not be another series with the original TNG crew!

Loving the fact that they found a way to make sense of incorporating Seven of Nine into this. Took me a while to adjust to her characters up to date evolution, but as one of my favourite Trek characters it was a joy to see how she is doing in the 25th century. And I absolutely love her relationship with Rafi.Now with the 3rd and last season underway, it really is bringing everything full circle with all of the TNG cast.

{"title":"A Balanced POST-FINALE Review","review":"Just finished watching the Season Finale so now that i've see the entire serious i feel like i can give it a fair and balanced review, without any spoilers.Having grown up with TNG, Voyager, and all those good trek vibes i was pretty excited for when Star Trek Discovery was announced. However i couldn't make myself finish the first season without feeling the need to keep a puke bucket next to me constantly. So when Picard was announced i had already resigned myself to the fact that CBS was going to find a new way to ruin my childhood and a national cultural legacy. However, after watching the show, i can honestly say it could have been a lot worse. Yes there were some unnecessarily dark moments, Picard and other returning characters are totally \"out of their character\", but i understand that the writers can't sit and watch every TNG episode and need a bit of flexibility, so i tried to be lenient. In the end i appreciated the attempt they had at actually having characters with good moral fiber who are trying to do the right thing as they explore issues that are relevant and relateable to us today, looking at it from both point of views instead of shoving one in your face, like old Star Trek was all about. The storyline was interesting enough to keep me engaged, and overall i thought the production quality was good and the ending satisfying. The characters are far less obnoxious and know-it-all than they are in STD.\nWhat i didn't like was how many of the core settings and principles of Star Trek were thrown out the window. The Federation didn't feel like an Utopia anymore, somehow money, drugs, and utter selfishness snuck their way back into Federation Space, and Picard is treated like some old relic of an age long past when the Federation was at its best Utopian potential. That is not what the Federation was ever meant to be at all, and that's what made Star Trek always stand out, especially now in a world full of grotesquely dark TV series that leave you more stressed out than you were during a busy workday. It is clear in TNG that Picard was just one of many \"stellar\" federation captains and crew members around the galaxy, but any evidence of that is long lost in Picard. Star Trek was great because it gave you a preview of what things could be like if humanity as a whole started to leave the things that make it suck in the past (war, poverty, corruption, etc) and instead embraced a higher and better way. If Q came along and put humanity on trial in STP, they would not pass.\nOne thing that really bothered me was the total lack of respect that was given to the once fearsome yet awe-inspiring Captain Picard. Gone are the days where ensigns would cower before the pillar of Leadership himself. Everytime Rafi calls Picard \"JL\" i die inside, and i'm missed that Picard would even allow anyone to use such a term to address him. Now Picard goes on \"undercover missions\" dressed up like the village clown ready to make a fool of himself at the local bar, totally lacking any of the Starfleet dignity that once endowed him.\nThe second out of character figure that was really upsetting was seven of nine. She went from a mostly emotionless, rigid, and logical ex-borg struggling to become human again (a journey with many parallels to data) to a vengeance-seeking space cowgirl who speaks and dresses like someone who grew up in some ranch in Montana. She would never have become a slave to her emotions. I'm glad that Admiral Janeway wasn't around to see her like this, because if she was, rest assured she would think that 4 TV seasons of hard work and tutoring had all gone to waste.\nEven thought the show was mediocre at best, i did enjoy it, especially towards the end where the plot starts to unfurl and things start to lighten up considerably. Heck, i even started to like space Legolas and Dr. Jurati and even the sour-faced Captain of La Sirena.\nIf this is your first exposure to Star Trek, you might enjoy it more than i do.\nLive Long and Prosper!","rating":"6\/10","date":"26 March 2020"}

As space travel evolves so must the people...Patrick is getting very old so perhaps the writers felt they had to taylor the show to fit the actor's advanced age, for it shows in every single episode I have seen so far.

{"title":"Stick with it","review":"It is a shame that so many people review a series after only a few episodes, with Picard as with so many show it takes time to develop the characters and plot.OK, Picard may seem slow the first few episodes, introducing new charters, setting the scene of the show, but this isn't TNG. We have a new cast, Jean-Luc needs to get his crew together. This hasn't been done elegantly but its done after episode 5 and they get on with the story, and oh boy its fantastic.For any TNG fan I dare you to watch episode 7 and not smile. Even if you have resigned to the view that you just hate the whole series, do your self a favour, forget about everything else, the reviews, plot, CGI, advancing years and enjoy the best hour of TV you'll watch in years.The story is great, Picard and Data was always a strong story line in TNG and it doesn't disappoint here, but this is just the tip of the ice-berg. A starting point for a much deeper and interesting story that has rocked the federation.Patrick Stewart is insane, the man is nearly 80 and as strong as an ox. His performance is beyond impeccable.

{"title":"Becoming more Star Trek like","review":"First of all, let me say that I am a seasoned Trek fan from the original series and a lot of TNG. 'Back in those days', I say with thumbs behind my imaginary suspenders, if you didn't write excellent story lines, the show would fail because the special effects were not going to be enough (and should never be enough). This is what made the original Twilight Zone successful, and Sterling had a shoestring budget.Fast forward to the 21st century (spoilers ahead). Picard S1 was barely keeping me awake with its convoluted plot lines, from completely forgettable Romulan siblings with a Games of Thrones recipe of sibling semi-attraction to each other (please...) to a hand held device that can become anything with the merest thought, instantaneously, to the appearance of an entire fleet of ships that are all exact copies. Ugh.Season 2 was definitely better but time travel is also so overdone and has been explored in various Trek movies, and because of it, anything can happen, which invites poor writing, and S2 wasn't full of great writing, but the ending was definitely a break from tradition at least.S3 has been way more captivating, and I'd give it 8 stars. It is made for the fans, and really steps up the cross references to canon in a way that is admirable. I really was enjoying it until the true villians were revealed in E09. Come on. Can't we find some other villian other than the most widely used ones from TNG? It USED to be frightening but now it's just recycled and I was really hoping for something more imaginative. Still, I expect a high bar based on the 1960's Trek stories, but at least the seasons of Picard have improved drastically. Terry Matalas at least seemed to listen to a lot of Trek input from fans and tried to make something to a much higher quality than Discovery (which is not Star Trek at all).Looking forward to Strange New Worlds S2, which so far is the closest thing to original Trek that's out there.","rating":"","date":"17 April 2023"}

A normal episode, people are willing to go along for the ride. But they all got an idea of how it is supposed to all end up for the characters.

The old foes are there - the Borg, the Romulans. Up to here, it's traditional Star Trek. The old crew is there - Data -Picard (Patrick Stewart) is still the charismatic, icon Captain of the Enterprise, but it's a different Enterprise of course. Though ageing, STP might just have arrived at the perfect time in the Star Trek world, to protect the new narrative of Star Trek. From this aspect, this show does a very good job.The show has a more cinematic feel to it, excellent editing, different lighting & very different camera angles of the characters. There is even swearing witch would have been frowned upon in the old Star Trek Generation days. There is also more segments of violence.So, my underlying question is why is Jean-Luc Picard no longer the Captain of the Enterprise? What could have removed our iconic Picard aqua from the Captain's chair? A mysterious cataclysm drove him out in disgust we find! That the strength of a STP - that utopian circumstances don't just happen in the Star Trek world. I'm looking forward to ensuing episodes elaborating on this notion.Even with a familiar face, we are cast into a new & excitingly fresh narrative of Star Trek, one much darker than we've ever seen before. I cannot wait to see where the show develops the story & narrative. Episode 1 is fantastic start....... If you are a Star Trek fan go in with an open mind & you will not be disappointed.","rating":"9\/10","date":"24 January 2020"}

I haven't even tried Discovery. But, I enjoyed the first episode of Picard. I know some conservatives are reacting to Stewart's comments but if you refuse to watch any show with a liberal then you are stuck with Goliath. Yes, its got some typical angles (women\/minorities are the heros, white men are evil or weak, and an obvious substitution of synthetics as the sympathetic illegals for the time). I would like to continue to watch it but refuse to pay a monthly fee AND watch commercials. That is freaking ridiculous.

That's not Star Trek. We love the show because it's sci-fi in space. I don't think my opinion on season 2 was in the minority either. Well they heard everyone's complaints about season 2 and are delivering spectacularly for season 3. This is what we wanted in the first place. Better late than ever.

{"title":"My Picard for this Show","review":"One-third into the 2nd episode of a (just now) 10-episode series, I was like: this could very well be my favorite Star Trek series.And that's after loving the very first episode to almost 5\/5 stars.But, alas, I practically grew up on Voyager; seen that entire 7-season show THREE times all the way through, plus many episodes many more times. That said, I was so impressed with Star Trek: Picard, if they get better with Season 2...Voyager may stay lost in the Delta Quadrant.I never thought the aging Patrick Stewart could pull this off. In Logan, he looked 20x his age, which was his character in that movie, but I didn't think he even had makeup on. Also, I didn't think bringing back his character was justification of an entire show. But I was thoroughly wrong. The new world, ah-hem, universe of the Federation storyline was so fascinating and grounded thanks to the presence of Stewart. So, I'm glad I was wrong.It's decades later, well, from the last present day TV series - since all movies and shows since Voyager have been prequels - and all Bishops, I mean, Datas have been banned from an obvious diabolical sabotage against them and it's up to Professor X and a new young mutant girl to...wait, am I describing Logan again, or Star Trek: Picard? Anyways, they're the same and Picard must resolve and show the universe what really happened to cause the ban.This is filled with WONDERFUL new characters, hilarious and sometimes deep dialogue, great cameos, AWESOME special effects and action and, biased here, a very much WELCOMED return of one of my all-time favorite characters. That said, her new storyline wasn't my favorite, but completely understandable and plausible.Also, it makes a ton of sense on why I love this so much: Writer Michael Chabon. I read his Wonder Boys book which was a masterpiece in writing and loved both that and the narrowed-down movie version. I always wanted to be a writer, but his Wonder Boys book actually discouraged me. I thought I could NEVER write as good as he did in that novel and each sentence would probably take me three weeks to complete, if I were to match him.But I digress. As much praise as I give this, I will say I was let down by the quick and somewhat TOO easy last two episodes. Before season 2 comes out, I will rewatch this entire run (only 10, but still) and I might change my mind. It's just that the first 8 episodes were so powerful and the last two, as of now in my opinion, standard.Doesn't matter. Even \"standard\" Star Trek: Picard episodes beat the majority of the Next Generation, Deep Space Nine and Enterprise episodes I've seen. Highly recommended. If you don't have CBS All Access, this ALONE is worth the price.***Final thoughts: Before I get hate mail, I've only seen about a dozen Next Gen's, only 6 Deep Space Nines and only the Enterprise pilot. So, when I made the comparison above, obviously people can disagree but in my limited experience with the older shows, I can 100% vouch for my August 2, 2020 opinion.","rating":"9\/10","date":"2 August 2020"}

{"title":"Do not watch it.","review":"Feels like the writer was constantly under the influence of some substance, as if they were disconnected from the essence of what Star Trek truly represents. This apparent lack of understanding has resulted in a disappointingly subpar creation. Moreover, it's evident that this series heavily relied on mindless action sequences, leaving little room for the intellectual and philosophical exploration that has been the hallmark of Star Trek.It felt as if the writer was perpetually on cocaine, chasing the adrenaline rush rather than crafting a coherent and thought-provoking narrative. This overemphasis on spectacle over substance detracted from the essence of Star Trek, robbing it of its depth and cultural significance. The excessive focus on mind-numbing action sequences at the expense of meaningful character development and compelling storytelling only served to highlight the lack of creative vision and understanding of what Star Trek represents.Additionally, there were significant issues with character development in later seasons. For instance, the character Jurati underwent a major transformation, becoming Borg in the end and making it clear that the Borg would not just be about mindless assimilation. However, in the subsequent season, she was inexplicably gone, and the meaning of the Borg was completely changed, portraying them as the ultimate destructor of all life forms. This inconsistency not only undermined Jurati's character arc but also disrupted the established lore and contradicted the previous understanding of the Borg.This disjointed mess falls far short of the high standards set by previous Star Trek installments, leaving fans and viewers deeply unsatisfied. It's truly disheartening to witness such a misguided attempt, making it one of the worst iterations in the franchise's history. It's a shame that such a promising concept was derailed by an apparent lack of vision and a disregard for what makes Star Trek a beloved and enduring series.In conclusion, this series feels like a product of a writer constantly under the influence of drugs, resulting in a terrible and misguided creation. The focus on mindless action and the absence of the intellectual exploration and philosophical depth that Star Trek is known for leaves a void in the narrative. It's a disappointing departure from the essence of the beloved franchise and a missed opportunity to deliver a compelling and thought-provoking storyline.\"","rating":"1\/10","date":"31 May 2023"}

I can't begin to tell you what this means to me and so many others who have followed Roddenberry's story and legacy. As a fan of Sci-fi it has been absolutely soul destroying to see the whole sale takeover of the Sci Fi scene with a maddening craze and a horrifyingly futuristic competitive arms race - to the extreme - and a kind of one up man ship style War Fest that has dominated the entire genre. All of which has somehow squeezed out any relatable human characters and grounded storytelling. Giving my eternal thanks to the producers who helped make this episode. To include members of the original \"next generation\" team that I and many of my generation appreciate so well, was a master stroke... and that's not to mention the excellent screen play that embodied real soul into the story once more.","rating":"10\/10","date":"12 March 2020"}

Cameos from past characters gives you the nostalgia you'd expect from a TV show that was at the pinnacle of Prime time TV in the 90's. But that was 30 years ago. Can it hold up? Well it does just that. Reintroducing old story arcs that work with the new Plot of the show and it doesn't miss a beat. I hope this show stays on for years to come.Some things they can improve on...Sometimes it feels like a big budget film and other times it feels like an outdated TV show. I'm not sure if they did this on purposed to give you that feeling of the Next Generation but I think it's time to move past the cheesy plot lines terrible scoring that so many TV shows suffer from. Special effects are absolutely great for the most part but then there are scenes where you can absolutely tell it's a Set.

{"title":"A Disappointment Overall If Somewhat Buoyed By Final Season TNG Reunion","review":"When I first heard that Paramount+ (then CBS All-Access) was making a Picard series featuring the return of Patrick Stewart, I was overjoyed. My all-time favorite Trek character back on the small screen again? Energize!I watched a few episodes and was carried on a wave of fond memories from watching The Next Generation as a burgeoning Trekkie. But then, the disappointment began creeping in. You see, S1 of Picard simply wasn't very good. It had some interesting ideas--like the Borg's Hugh (Jonathan Del Arco) & Seven of Nine (Jeri Ryan)--and showcased the return of a few old friends (Spiner as \"Data\", Frakes & Sirtis as the ever-relatable Riker & Trio), but overall it fell a bit flat (4\/10 stars).Of course, simply having Stewart back in the fold assured commercial success and a second season was all but guaranteed. After teasing the return of Q (John de Lancie) and more Borg content, I was again all-in on Picard. This time, it was clear right from the jump what a mess the season would be (2\/10 stars). Absolutely nothing works from beginning to end and I consider this the worst single season of anything Trek ever produced. Truth be told, I was about as \"out\" on a show as I could be despite my longing to love it. It was simply that bad.Likely sensing a similar phenomena amongst the fanbase, Paramount made the decision to end the series after a third season--one which teased a full-blown Next Gen cast reunion. So, bolstered by a final run of the Trek I grew up on, I gave it until the end. Though S3 is no great shakes plot-wise, it certainly delivers on the nostalgic front. Not only are Stewart, Frakes, Spiner, Burton, Dorn, McFadden, & Sirtis all remarkably in the same place at the same time, but that place is the bridge of the Enterprise-D. I will admit that tears were shed on a few occasions here, saving a run of episodes that isn't all that inspiring but for the blatant-but-poignant nostalgia grab (6\/10).Average that all out and one comes to a 4\/10 overall rating, which seems about right for Picard if objectivity enters into the equation whatsoever. Other than nostalgia for the Next Gen characters & universe, Picard never really does anything groundbreaking or noteworthy. Not a single new character endeavor themself to me and there wasn't one plot angle that was successfully constructed and executed from beginning to end.Probably the biggest disappointment of Picard? The odd portrayal of the titular character from Stewart. Either Sir Patrick is a bit too old for the verve and vigor he once provided the role, or he simply didn't want to play Jean-Luc Picard and instead wanted to mix in more \"Patrick Stewart\" (i.e. He seemed to be playing himself as much as his iconic starship captain).I think it is quite telling that the only time this series really \"worked\" for me was when the Next Generation crew was reunited on the bridge of the Enterprise D for the final few episodes. Because that is what fans wanted from this show all along. Though it took the Picard writers\/producers\/creators two seasons to realize a stand-alone Picard show simply wouldn't cut the mustard in today's Trek atmosphere, I guess fans should just be fortunate that at least the TNG reunion was leaned into during the final run of episodes. Without that, this production would have been a stain on the TNG legacy instead of a fun coda to it.","rating":"4\/10","date":"21 April 2023"}

{"title":"This needs to get better and fast (warning : this review has very few spoilers)","review":"I saw the first 3 episodes and this is what I think as of now.The first episode was a bit slow but still, I was ok with it. There was talk about the rights of androids and synthetic people, ok, nice, this is the kind of dilemmas Star Trek does very well. I'm glad it starts to talk about subjects like that again. It was a good sign, I thought to myself that a new Star Trek show is going in the right direction, finally.Like some people already wrote here episode 2 was blabla and more bla, talk talk talk and no substance. Bo-ring. Then came episode 3 and again, nothing interresting happened. At least the first episode had a little action but episodes 2 and 3 had none. This is getting annoying. I have some patience left but please don't abuse it.Some of the new actors are fine but this show needs to get better and fast. Personally the \"F\" word didn't upset me that much, although it surprised me a bit, I must admit. But since it shocked so many people, maybe it's not a good idea to use it again. Doctor McCoy often said \"Damn it Jim\" and people weren't that offended about it so why not use \"damn it\" instead ? It's just a suggestion. Just sayin'Even the strenghs of the show are not properly acknowledged. Come on, you had \"Hugh the Borg\" on screen (on episode 3) for the first time in maybe 20 years and they acted like it's not a big deal, it is a big deal, I almost didn't recognized the actor and I loved him so much back in the day.Please, please, please, make Seven Of Nine appearances matter and do integrate some of the old TNG 's familiar faces very fast before my interrest vanishes through the airlock because I'm very close to jump out of this show if it doesn't improve pretty quickly.Especially after so many failures in the Trek universe (Enterprise, Discovery, the new Timeline movies), this Star Trek show cannot afford to fail or it really will be the end of the Trek we all know and love !","rating":"6\/10","date":"10 February 2020"}

{"title":"How did it go so wrong?","review":"I quite enjoyed the first season of Picard despite having read a number of negative reviews before seeing it. The story line was quite clever and held together well with the writing, directing and acting all seeming to be working together.The second season was still entertaining although the storyline was a little more contrived. I found the writing and directing were still good but some of the acting made me cringe a little.When it came to season 3, the decline in the standard of writing was much more evident. Whose idea was this story in any case? Exactly how lazy do you have to be to come up with this kind of mind-numbing rubbish? The writing was atrocious and varied from simplistic to disjointed. The direction in the second half of the series was extra poor but that's probably because the story could barely hold itself together and I doubt *any* actor could have made anything worthwhile from that pig's breakfast. It came out as merely self-indulgent.Not since Deep Space Nine have I so longed for the show to end and the relief I received from learning that the show had been cancelled was unmistakeable.I love the Star Trek franchise and always have but when the producers, writers, directors and actors don't have sufficient regard for their audience and serve up a declining standard of product, it's difficult not to believe that they have chosen commercialism over quality as their guiding principle. That whirring sound you can hear is Gene Roddenberry spinning in his grave.","rating":"7\/10","date":"2 July 2023"}
{"title":"Absolutely Brilliant.","review":"As long as you don't go in expecting TNG season 8, then you are in for a thrill.Exploring new aspects of the universe, without betraying what we know, this show balances exciting ideas and story developments with fascinating character arcs and exploration.The acting is fantastic and it is absolutely brilliant to see Patrick Steward as Picard again.While there are a few flaws, overall it is a great start and I cannot wait for the next season.","rating":"10\/10","date":"14 June 2020"}

Q hasn't shown up...\nyet.Hope that is is the last we will see of the TNG elder Starfleet officers.Oh, Lore makes an appearance (merciful short)The main distinguishing fact of season 3 is that the MOST annoying character in the history of Star Trek is introduced in Picard season three.... you will know it when you hear ans see it. ALMOST enough to stop watching. But as I've seen every episode of every live action production so far and after having suffered through Deep Space its going to take more than that to keep me away.... wait that makes me part of the problem.Anyway Star Trek has a far superior track record of milking the cow than the many G_D awful Star Wars atrocities.","rating":"7\/10","date":"17 April 2023"}

This merely succeeds in making Picard look like a doddery old bloke who might simply be waiting for the girls' clothes to fall off (you need to watch the far more entertaining episode of Extras starring Patrick Stewart to get the allusion).

{"title":"I Like the New Star Trek ....","review":"The old Star Treks were based on a different premise, that they were on a big mission, with set goals and mission parameters. Under those parameters, each episode had it's own story to tell that started and ended, so it moved quickly. They were usually upbeat an optimistic, but in reality unrealistic. Real life is darker than that and is often not optimistic. Picard takes the viewer in a different direction than the old Star Treks, one that I think is more in line with the times with which we live... think of Game of Thrones or The Dark Knight; hero movies with a gritty a realistic feel to them that tell the truth about the world. I think that is the direction where Picard took us with it's story. Visually, it is Beautifully made. The cinematography is beautiful, not like the old once a week low budget shows we used to watch, but high quality, high budget work, set initially in Picard's beautiful vineyard that he longed for all of those years aboard the enterprise. Later, the CG work aboard the star ships is fantastic, showing exceptional detailing and texture, better than any of the Treks that came before, and the technology has even been updated to include Artificial Intelligent interfaces and VR and AR control interfaces for the ship. The abandoned Borg ship (artifact) is extremely interesting, as is the mystery surrounding the existence of Data's apparent offspring. Unlike the single story per episode, the story-line runs through the whole series, which, I suppose is why some people think it is slow, compared to the old shows... but the format is not different than other series that are out, and is actually the rule, more than the exception. I actually like it better; It gives more time to develop a more complex story than in just a single episode. I also like having the mix of new and old characters in the show. Introducing new characters leaves the show open for new seasons to develop as old characters drop out and new ones develop. I hope there is another season. The haters need to stop complaining or they won't have any Star Trek to watch. This Star Trek was well done!","rating":"10\/10","date":"26 March 2020"}

They said a naughty word - I'm offended! (There's no such thing as an F-bomb BTW... it's a proper Anglo-Saxon word referring to copulation - it's part of your language. It's normal to use and hear it.)\nWah! It's not like the old stuff! It's not the same! Therefore it's rubbish and I hate it! Well, I guess people are entitled to their opinions, Unfortunately they can now make them public and demonstrate how shallow and stuck they are. And then there's the opposite crowd who don't think it goes far enough - Wah! It's not addressing LGBTQIAAP++UKFR9SMYOFB issues - this needs to be fixed NOW! Vanishingly small minority X are not represented - Wah! Etc., ad nauseam.I'm sorry you don't like it. Scratch that - I'm not at all sorry, and I don't care if you don't like it for whatever reason. Don't like it? Don't watch it - problem solved. You are not entitled to have whatever programme you want to pander to your own specific needs\/wants\/expectations. Why not try writing your own? If you can do better, and think that more people would like and appreciate your efforts, then try and get it made. Good luck with that. If we had the ST that you want we would never have had Chekov or Sulu, Uhura, Sisko, Janeway... the list goes on. Perhaps you didn't notice that ST always reflected what was happening at the time it was made, and so it should. It was also always inconsistent, had bad writers\/sets\/effects\/costumes\/makeup, weak stories, weak characters, was technically inaccurate, bad acting (I'm looking at you, Shatner...).And yet, Patrick Stewart likes it. He wouldn't have agreed to it otherwise. He even had two conditions before agreeing to consider it - no uniform, no Enterprise, so that was going to annoy the 'We want more TNG\" crowd from the outset. This was a calculated and deliberate move. The rest of the cast that return from TNG and Voyager like it, or they wouldn't be in it. Perhaps they know something you don't? Perhaps they are more mature, open-minded, adventurous and creative than you can imagine. I like it, and I grew up with ST in all its forms. It was always changing, always different, and always had people moaning about it. At least that has stayed the same. And the people who like it, appreciate it for what it is and have grown up along the way are also there, and that, fortunately, is also the same. And that's why there are all these high ratings for it.Here's another one.NB: A lens flare is a real thing. When you point a lens at a bright light, it happens. They can be beautiful. They happen in the real world.","rating":"9\/10","date":"8 February 2020"}

{"title":"Not as bad as people say","review":"First up, thinking this will be like the episodic thematic TNG or voyager will be disappointed. This is a new age, sci-fi action drama filled with nostalgia.Second, as a sci-fi, it is okay.I blame the writing, story pacing, and editing for delivering a badly paced beginning, and bad character development, motivations etc. Near the end, you can piece together the reasons and motives for our characters, but imo, it is too late.Also, like synth war? Yes please, show me more of that. Show me how all the main characters are affected by it. SHOW ME! Lots of talking but...Why didn't you show me....? Sci fi opportunity fail here. Big war no show. Just a few cgi laser beams.Onto the overall story...Anyone can argue, why is this story being told? News flash, every story ever has been told already, so no new groundbreaking ideas are going to come up any time soon. However, that's no excuse for poor storytelling though. ;)Some episodes stand out. Particularly with Jerri Ryan. She gets a full on motivated revenge arc. Remove seven of nine and replace her with generic girl type with same revenge arc, and it would still be satisfying to see her blast her once evil lover into tiny burnt pieces. Story done right. Too bad it was just an add on, a ride along if you will, to the actual main plot.Nostalgic actors bring...well nothing, expect GOOD ACTING. Damn...so they bring in good actors to do nothing, but then we can compare them to the subpar acting of the rest of the main cast... Yikes...The organization of this thing is just plain off. All the ingredients are there, they just cooked them wrong.It seems like i'm being very harsh, but really, a lot of campy sci-fis are like this. And it's still action packed, and the cinematography is good. And i mean, come on Patrick Stewart is great. Villain Vulcans and Romulans. Nice. There is a lot to like.But I suppose the fact that it's in the Star Trek universe is a double edged bat'leth.So 6\/10 for me.","rating":"6\/10","date":"17 August 2020"}

{"title":"Season 1 Six\/ten Season 2 unwatchable Season 3 A pre funeral for Picard & 8","review":"Season semi interesting picking up trying to recover from Nemesis.Season 2 I couldn't finish past 4 episodes enough of Q and multi\/ alternate universe garbage between DC & Marvel, all ripping off Rod Serling It was insufferable.The Final season I'd give a 7.5 star, and though clearly a final farewell for the crew of the next generation. The infiltration of the Borge via Picard's son and use of human DNA as a pitch, sounds horrible. But that's not figured out till the 7th episode. So the mystery conspiracy plot line of the overall story, with a fine reappearance of the best actor from the series the Klingon Worf and his role as a undercover handler and operator.With highly emotional acting from Patrick Stewart, with ample swearing doesn't make it feel like a dorkish Star Trek...but a phenomenal well written with non robotic performances was plotted out very well.To understand some of the medical sci-fi components integral to the third series you have to manage a below expectations first season.The end gets too emotional for Patrick Stewart like his personal dealing with his age, and the series he is best know for concluding permanently despite being a Thespian actor, is perhaps too \"realistic\"The Borge ending again though is overkill. But from my perspective there hasn't been a cast or spin-off to match 1966 and most of their films. And the Borge was the one of the few decent story lines from the original series.I like the commentary on the dangers facing people over 40 how the millennial and Z generation enamored with socialism if they can't see it's dangers even in basic media, I welcome the repetitive theme despite the myriad of shows trying to drill the message in while trying to maintain other extreme leftist pluralism ideology. Because there is a fine line in community and individual freedoms as well as those of free markets, individuality and creativity. For the \"Social Democrats\".DRNK - There is nothing that is Democratic or Republic about North Korea. Any country that has to put Democratic Republic in its title is a lame attempt to tell that it's the opposite.","rating":"6\/10","date":"20 April 2023"}

The focus should be on the current attack not on the failed relationship of two of the lead roles, 20 years ago might I add. Oh, and I'm not sure if anyone else has caught this, but accents are not GENETICALLY inherited...they are learned!

I can't talk for the ST New Worlds (didn't see it yet). Now after seeing all the bunch, ST NG and ST DS9 are the best and , far away in their trail comes this one Picard. Let's face it, first season was weak even if one can see that Patrick Stewart really tried hard to revive the good years. This second season has more action and even ideas. In this second season you can feel that Patrick Stewart is at his limits, his age limits, you can feel that in his voice and rhythm. It was adelight to see the Borg queen comeback, she steals the scene. Whoopi Goldeberg, not that she looks old , but she looks like a baloon, I think she has over 100kg, she looks really bad and almost spoiled the show in those sequences.

{"title":"A pragmatic look at promised Utopia!","review":"Star Trek Picard is a brilliant take on continuing the story line from where we last saw Picard. An old man biding his time, takes on the opportunity to make a difference one last time and to try to make amends of his perceived failures. Failures that irk more due to all the successes he is used to. The way Picard deals with frailties that are natural part of ageing has been brilliantly portrayed. You do not get your invincible captain instead you get an admiral who confronts his limitations but yet shows the passion and determination that made him \"The greatest captain ever!\"I am a great fan of the Utopian society that TNG presented to us when were growing up, but it also interesting to explore a world that turns bad in spite of the greatest good intentions. And the way the season ends is so typical Picard. All the scenes that seem pointless are tied together neatly in the end and give a larger understanding of how the characters were shaped.There are also great visuals on how technology possibly looks in the future and the way we interface with it, while keeping to Star Trek roots of capturing the mystique and grandeur of space and faster than light travel.To end, Picard is a thoughtful, poignant continuation of the Star Trek story with all the baggage that time and their experiences would add to the shows main characters. It is how they deal with it and still stay true to the principles that made them who they were is what you should take away from the series and it is a \"fascinating\" watch!","rating":"8\/10","date":"9 May 2020"}

An optimistic tale about humanity ability to achieve greatness. This show is not about it. None of new reboots are. Perhaps we're just not so optimistic about the future now and not so eager to explore... which is kind of sad.I don't mind some hardcore fan level inconsistencies (remember the TNG episode where Picard experiences his future?), but the general vision of the universum seems to be off.","rating":"7\/10","date":"9 April 2020"}

{"title":"Just about made a 7!","review":"The first season of Star Trek Picard was 'average' to 'good' in my opinion as it just about scraped a 7. I felt the show was at it's best when the episodes were 55 mins as opposed to 40-45 mins, so not sure why they had different running time lengths for episodes. So in my opinion, the standout positives from season one i would say was the episode Nepenthe - It was great to get a back story for Riker and Troi. The episode as whole was the best paced out of all of the others and one that i felt most reminiscent to the TNG feel. On top of that, the tone of Nepenthe was very good and interactions between characters were well written especially between Picard, RIker and Troi. Patrick Stewart felt much more like Picard in this episode for me - with regards to his tone of voice and acting. I found the scenes in episode 10 involving Data were well written bringing closure for Picard after his regrets with Data. I found Rios to be a likeable character out of the new cast, i enjoyed the scene where you see him in a photograph wearing a starfleet uniform which makes him feel as though he once belonged to an enlighten vision of trek. I feel he has the potential to enhance his character development and would like to see him as part of starfleet again. Dahj as a character has potential, just very much depends on how they write her in season 2. In terms of the music - I found the scoring at times to be good and consistent with the post TNG\/Nemesis era so well done to Jeff Russo for that - however, i do feel there is over-scoring at times which can undermine the emotive moments.I wouldn't say i am particularly fond of some of Picard's rag tag crew. I find the character Dr Agnes Jurratti to be frustrating and rather cliche of the 21st century quirky driven feel similar to that of Tilly in Discovery. Jurrati's character just doesn't fit this particular timeline in my opinion - she would be more suited to the pre Star Trek: Enterprise era. I also didn't feel connected with Raffi. I felt she was also cliche and reflective of 21st century characteristics. There is potential with her and i do believe they should have done more to demonstrate her connection with Picard underlining why she refers to him as \"JL\". I believe the producers and writers should have created an episode at the beginning of the season that was dedicated to Raffi and Picard connoting them in 2387. Picard as an Admiral, Raffi as First Officer on the USS Variety demonstrating there professional starfleet relationship and then leading on to why her and Picard became close. This for me would be much more acceptable way to create more of backstory for Raffi and may make it more acceptable for her to refer to picard as \"JL\" and naturally enable us to have more of solid connection to her.Now, what i would personally like to see in season 2:1) To ensure each episode is roughly the same running time e.g. 55 mins so that it enables the writers to reflect character driven moments better and naturally embeds the story to be coherent.\n2) To ensure that there starfleet ships are internally and externally are represented better through season 2 ensuring it is consistent with the post TNG\/Nemesis timeline. (Riker appeared on a redress of the Discovery Bridge which was visually jarring and disappointing in season 1 and seeing discovery style shuttles doesn't make sense).\n3) To ensure that there is more collaboration between Picard and TNG\/Voyager characters to help guide the show through season 2 and allowing characters like Rios, Sohji and Raffi to develop more in line with the morals reflected within TNG post nemesis era.\n4) To ensure that it isn't about AI which is cliche of current Sci-Fi, make season 2 more interesting and unique and maybe reflect upon Picard's love for Archaeology.\n5) maybe bring in species 8472 (with talk of Janeway being in Picard - this could be a good way to generate a Janeway spin-off!)\n6) Possibility of having a few episodic episodes within a serialised ark for season 2 which relates indirectly to the overall arch.\n7) Ensure that there is no over elaborate melodrama which i think was badly reflected in the Characters of Commodore Oh and Narissa (Again cliche of 21st century writing).\n8) Make sure the science makes theoretical sense in line with what was established within the TNG\/Nemesis era. (Not dumbed down).\n9) not over-scoring every scene with musical scores.There are many more ideas, but overall - i do feel PIcard is heading in the right direction, i do accept it as 'canon' and very much part of TNG post nemesis Timeline whereas, Discovery i found difficult to accept so far as part of Canon.","rating":"7\/10","date":"10 April 2020"}

I know most of the writer and director of this series are amateur and with a strict supervise from pro producer, im sure they will success. Not mind Patrick Steward performance coz he already pro in this matter, but mind Isa Briones acting, she could be the best character ive seen in star trek picard, i hope she can be more character driven, ive never seen her before but already made me an awe with her performance. The others i dont mind that much. Yeah, like i said that i think theres should be more storyline to tell, more creativesness please, well from the tech they use, from the effect, from the futuristic structure, i think cbs should invest more effect in this drama, so i can defeat all others star trek franchise, please dont be like star trek discovery, they already ruin the franchise.

{"title":"A bit slow but setting things up","review":"Why all the hate? All these negative reviews seem to be done with the attitude of expecting a sequel to come from a stasis chamber and not change from the old. That attitude prevents shows from finding their feet and becoming something new and possibly even better. The only problem most of you seem to have is does not have a light hearted feel like the Star Treks of old. (which The Orville does very well I agree.).While this episode was a little slow, and even a little silly in spots, the whole point of it was to set up the characters for the next aspect of the story. As to it being dark, well guess what. The future will be like the past and have dark times too. That is the nature of the world, including the Federation world, I am sure. I am enjoying this and see it as an overarching story of Picard forging a new set of colleagues to try and save his old friend Data's offspring and hopefully find out what skulduggery is afoot within the Federation he used to love,and wants to save. Reading all these negative reviews raving on that it is \"not like the Star Trek of old\", makes me want to shake my head in despair. That so many want things replicated exactly as they were, is quite frankly, an exercise in futility. Why futile!!! Because then others would say the show is stale and out of touch with modern thinking.","rating":"7\/10","date":"21 February 2020"}
{"title":"Worst timeline fix storyline in Star Trek history.","review":"Picard Season 2 is painful to watch. The story line is a copy of so many prior episodes & movies about needing to fix the timeline. Mixed in with plenty of woke hate spewed across episodes. I canceled Paramount+ and stop watching by episode 3.","rating":"1\/10","date":"1 July 2022"}
{"title":"So far, I'm on board.","review":"I thought the first episode was very good. I don't mind that the idealism of the Roddenberry vision is currently dented, as no human society or system is going to remain inert. There would definitely be set-backs and periods of reversal which would have to be dealt with by new visionaries.\nThe characters seemed to be well-realised and I didn't notice \"clunky dialogue\" and \"ham-fisted editing\" which some claimed they saw.\nThere was certainly nothing \"woke\" about this episode.\nThe story is promising and I'm intrigued to see where it goes. I don't think it will matter if the show isn't populated by Next Generation characters, as I imagine the new ones will become familiar to viewers before long; but it will be nice to see Seven Of Nine and Riker again, along with any other old faces, whenever they pop up.\nI like the idea of Data's legacy being a part of the plot.\nWe'll have to see how this progresses but, for me, this was good in all the ways that Star Trek Discovery was bad.","rating":"9\/10","date":"24 January 2020"}
{"title":"Stewart is the best part","review":"Patrick Stewart is what makes this series work. He delivers his best performance since Logan and thats why you watch it. Sure its a little weird how it combines the recent star trek films and the next generation into this universe. And sure the series seems to throw in forced cameos of previous Star Trek series(especially Next Gen) but the general focus on Stewart works and works great. Im looking forward to seeing where they take his character as the series progresses. If you can get into the series on that premises then you will like it","rating":"7\/10","date":"5 April 2020"}
{"title":"This is not the Star Trek you remember not the one you expect","review":"The show has some glaring flaws. Visually it's a stunning piece, but storywise, it relies heavily on over expositions to an extent where it becomes extremely artificial. But that's not the biggest issue. This is not what Star Trek should be, nor the characters or the federation. For an extremely short amount of time (roughly 20 years) it seems the federation moved from idealistic utopian society to closed of, bickering, xenophobic gathering of people over night. Everyone projects aprehention, threats are tossed around without a second thought, Picard aims helplessly around the events. There are Romulans around not exhibiting a single established romulan trait. No trace of pride, arrogance, lack of compassion. They are named romulans, have some visual traits and pointy years but other than that are run of the mill humans.This show is a generic run of the mill sci-fi show, with Patrick Stewart and a boring story. I'm extremely saddened by it","rating":"3\/10","date":"30 January 2020"}

I only watched the entire series more times than I care to recount. (a \"true\" fan could tell you exactly how many times and do it in Borgian Binary no doubt) Look, if you are the totally self involved, control freak, who has to have everything their way, then sure, this will not be your cup of Romulan Ale. BUT, if you are a more selfless fan, who appreciates the fact that the stars of the original series are even willing to take their fans to a few more places that no fan has gone before....then this is rather like a refreshing cup of Earl Gray served up hot in a day and age that's kind of not.I find the show truly 'engaging', Stewart comports himself well, as do all the stars of the original series appearing thus far (7 episodes in). The new actors have clearly done their homework here, and blend in well, I find. But then, I'm capable of having an open mind. If you're apt to go into this with your conflated ego on your shoulder, then maybe take a hard pass, don't be an ass, and go play some 3D chess on your daddy's collector's set.Picard is a Hit and I hope it gets a second season, or as many as acting legend, Patrick Stewart is willing to do!Live long, and prosper.","rating":"10\/10","date":"7 March 2020"}

Good god or high synth being, I could not re-watch a single episode from either of those old series because they are so dated on so many levels.If the franchise wants to attract new fans then they have to try something different that is a clean break from how stories were told in previous series. Star Trek Picard is different and it achieved something the older series could never do. But will die hard Trek fans give it any credit, I think not.","rating":"10\/10","date":"24 March 2020"}
{"title":"very watchable but not the star trek we know","review":"I accidentally picked up a subscription to amazon prime whilst buying something else and took advantage of the small window which i had been given to watch this series. it was rather unusual to say the least. it did not feel like the star trek which i know and love but was much darker and much more bitter. picard has made a stand which has earned the disfavour of the federation and is now an outcast, mainly due to saving the romulans from certain destruction in the very last star trek movie. following his resignation over star fleet's decision to let romulus burn, he has to acquire his own craft when a new crisis involving synthetic lifeforms begins to emerge as starfleet refuses to help. it gets pretty violent as the universe is shown to be such a ruthless and unforgiving place. a supposedly decomissioned borg cube figure into the plot and picard must confront the wounds of his past. there are more than a few ex borgs around, this fairs better than you might think as they just want to get on with their lives; seven of nine, however, has other ideas and tries to take control of the cube for herself, it is still sentient and aware so this does not bode too well. picard assembles a new crew but they are a pretty mixed and dubious bunch with all kinds of issues, not what he was once used to. this leads to incidents which star fleet would probably not have approved of. picard gets to meet some old friends, which was rather sentimental but lovely. the synthetics go berserk and threaten to destroy all humanoid life with the aid of their extradimensional friends, vastly superior to anything we have ever seen before. the romulans have some ruthless secret agents, the female one in particular is gorgeous and truly deadly, one of the best if not the best character of the show. the whole thing does resemble firefly to some degree, although picard makes a more humane and principled hero than mel, kind of like a cross between mel and book actually. picard is dying so he has a clock to work against, data is dying too only it's not really him it's his brother, noonian soong data's creator has an important role to play near the end. i felt that the series was trying to work out what it wanted to do, i felt that it was a little slow and self indulgent perhaps and could have been better paced; that said, some ideas were great and some scenes were very tense and exciting. i get the feeling that this show will improve as it goes on; series two and series three have apparently already been confirmed. let's hope they do indeed get better.","rating":"7\/10","date":"30 July 2020"}
{"title":"Amazing stories","review":"I grew up watching next generation and reruns of the original series. So I see what some reviewers mean by the corrupted federation complaints. But look at our own history; and episodes of those aforementioned shows where they reflect on mistakes humans have made with good intentions. Humans repeat their history when mistakes aren't learned from. When you get to the end of the first season you realize the genius of it. I love the writing and the story and the people. I really have felt of late that most shows revolve around everyone being a detective or a hit man. Having a show with different ideas and creativity is really noticeably refreshing.\nThey did take liberties with the general aesthetic of previous star treks and merging with a modern touch so it kind of felt a little off in that way. When you look at \"next generation\" it has a kinder, gentler touch. Picard makes a nod to that, I believe, in the amazing cameo with Number one.\nOverall the writing and the way they weaved it all together is really great. There hasn't been much tv or anything of late that is this good.","rating":"10\/10","date":"23 February 2021"}

Too bad this happened during the last ten minutes of a 45 runtime. Anyhow, I decided I would watch episode 2 and it was quite good, the script starts to take off.

{"title":"Absolutely Brilliant","review":"After watching STNG passionately during its original showing from 1987 to 1992, I have to say this series to date was a superbly evocative and very well made piece of work with a great storyline and brilliant special effects. I am eagerly awaiting season 2.I found the gradual introduction of the STNG characters heartwarming after so long, the impression the show made on me at the time was profound and to see some of my favourite characters return after more than 30 years was quite emotive. Patrick Stewart, now in his late 70's does not try to pretend in character that so much time has passed but sticks to the essence of what he was in the original series and later movies. It was awesome to see the return of Jonathan Frakes ,Marina Sirtis and Brent Spiner again. Jeri Ryan as 7 of 9 is as stunning to look at today as she was in Voyager, and it was great to see the return of Jonathan Del Arco as Hugh to help in the context of the Borg part of the plot.I thought also the introduction of new characters fit well, Commodore Oh was as driven and determined as you would expect from a radical Vulcan\/Romulan hybrid, Rios plays a Han Solo type character while his dark and troubled side is developed along side martial artist Elnor, a strong grudge holding but talented detective Raffi and the essential medical doctor Jurati. With the exception of the Narek character, who came across as far too millennially human, I thought all characters were developed beautifully.I respectfully with the naysayers here, who say this is not Star trek, that it is a dystopia opposite of Star Trek. Instead, I thought Star Trek Picard brought back the essence of STNG characters that are now taking on a world 30 years advanced. The characters stick to their morals and beliefs of STNG. I see comparisons to Discovery but Picard and Discovery to me are diametrically opposed. In fact it is Discovery I found deviating from the Star Trek Vision, not Picard. Discovery tried too hard to adjust to the modern world and appeal to acceptance of race, religion, culture and sexuality. It is Discovery that would make Gene Roddenberry turn in his grave, not Picard.I am sincerely looking forward to the introduction of Worf, Geordi , Beverly Crusher and anyone else that can bring back the memories.Cannot wait for more seasons.","rating":"10\/10","date":"2 November 2020"}

I wouldn't mind if he were a cool new character with some unique skims. Instead however, he's a clich\u00e9 who doesn't follow the rules. You know, a rebel who does his own thing like a million other Hollywood clich\u00e9 characters. He gets annoying right away, but it gets worse as he begins to have an identity crisis and starts whining about not knowing who he is.

Of times over & over & over again. Reason?: just to hear the fantastic varied unique BACKGROUND MUSIC in most of the scenes of both shows! That takes a LOT of work & creativity! When you JUST HEAR ANY of that unique background music for either show, you KNOW EXACTLY what you are watching! I am NOT talking about the intro opening credit score\/theme. (& look where TNG got it's opening theme from!)\nThere is virtually NO such varied UNIQUELY IDENTIFIABLE background music in ANY later LIS or trek tv show or movie or any other sci fi show or movie for that matter - even Star Wars! - all they play in the latter is the opening theme over & over again. Ironically, John(ny) Williams ALSO did all the background music for classic LIS - amazing music. & all the ST TOS background music is equally fantastic. & all that unique background music matches the tones\/situations of the scenes too! & keeps those 50!!! Minute episodes moving & from being boring.In ST TNG on the bridge, all you hear is the same old monotone beeping in the background - boring! TOS has much more varied background SOUNDS too. Even the phasers & transporter sound much better on TOS. & it's odd that the doors on the TOS enterprise & especially its shuttlecrafts open much FASTER than those on TNG!

I know there are others on the writing teams too and I think they presented a fresh story that new fans can get into w out watching every ST 2000xs like I have; but us hard core fans had plenty of canon and call backs tonight to satisfy2) Patrick Stewart was artful and showed his acting prowess out of the gate. And the cast tonight rose to his level.3) Great locations, action and tech. Warm tones and colors and a reflective opening theme song.4) A thoughtful, promising, engaging and very well done first show.

{"title":"Surprisingly good with some flaws","review":"After having watched Star Trek Discovery I was expecting more of the same style over substance, over-emoting and unbelievable plot developments. I enjoyed STD to an extent but its very different from the star trek that has gone before and suffers for it. After watching the first two episodes of Picard my suspicions seemed confirmed. A few things were puzzling:Why are Romulans speaking with different earth accents? I believe I heard Irish, English and Australian? Bizarre.Why on earth would the Federation abandon Romulus to the supernova? The Federation are humanitarians even to their enemies. But not this time for some reason.Also, why would the Romulans even need help to get everyone off the planet? They are an advanced space faring race. Surely this was doable even in a short amount of time.Anyway, then the Dahj storyline comes into play. Suddenly she appears out of nowhere at Picard's side at his vineyard without a hint of difficulty. So far, so tediously convenient and easy.But then things start to get more interesting when the new crew is assembled. Raffi, Cristob\u00e1l and Elnor are interesting characters and great actors, particularly Michelle Hurd who plays Raffi. Soji is a little one dimensional. Perhaps its the limitation of the actor. Its the characters and the relationships between them that really make the show.Nice to see 7 of 9 back though she seemed too much of a stereotypical hardened anti-hero figure in this. Much different to the stern, matter of fact ex-Borg we are used to in Voyager. I missed seeing the Borg in Annika. This new Annika was a bit too human for me unfortunately, more broken. I always admired 7's strength of character, intelligence and general bad-assery. She could basically do everything. Annika seems more limited somehow though, vulnerable.It also helps that there is kind of interesting and fun story in here too. Even if it does stretch the believability meter. An evil A.I race leaves a message to future A.I. that, if summonsed, they will come to destroy all organic humanoids. Why? Their motives are never explored. Plus, how can the Romulans have a premonition of who summons them? The beacon was a warning of what had happened not of what will happen. And yet they seem to know the future. How is that possible? It makes no sense. Regardless, I did enoy the mystical element of the show. Not everyone thing needs to be explained and i could happily ignore this for the sake of the rest of the show. Sci-fi needs a bit of mysticism to balance itself. I suppose though that Star-trek is semi-mystical at times and I'm thankful for that.Overall I enjoyed the show. There was one big plot hole (yes, another) that was hard to ignore though. Why does Soji's sister want to destroy all organic humanoid life, having had such little contact with them? Her creators after all were organic and nothing but respectful toward her. Why does she convince the others to summon the AI? There is very little motivation for this. The synthetics are supposed to be smart but also wise like Data. Yet she shows a callous disregard for both organic and synthetic life. It's hard to believe she was designed this way. This is a bit jarring to say the least. Just a poor excuse to push the story along.Apart from the flaws mentioned I did enjoy the show, probably slightly more than STD. The characters in Picard are thankfully likable and there is enough complex storytelling here that, most of the time, falls on the side of believability.","rating":"7\/10","date":"7 June 2020"}

{"title":"Great for a CBS show","review":"This is pretty entertaining and it's a bonus that we already know and love many of the characters. Yes Picard is a bit different from his STNG era but given that life has happened and he's basically retired we should expect him to be a bit more settled. Granted, after about the 5th episode I was becoming a little angsty about his loss of fervor and repeated obsession with Data, but those doesn't take that much away from the overall enjoyment of the show. I especially like Elnor and how he teamed up with Seven of Nine. There are many different smaller story lines like the Borgs and also seven's story that can take off into really great segues. I'm also interested in the father-daughter undertones of the relationship between Picard and Soji. It's American TV so it comes with a lot of Melodrama and sometimes some over acting, like Rafi when she first entered the picture around episode 3. But if you keep an open mind and an eye toward nostalgia the show is loads of fun. Just don't expect this to be a direct pick up of where things left off decades ago with next generation. Despite the same characters it's different. It's almost like they didn't live those lives, like the time on next generation happened to other versions of them. But can't that be said for most of us and our pasts? I think the bad reviews are just snobby, people expecting this to be just like NG and Mad that it's more like real life AFTER NG.","rating":"7\/10","date":"18 May 2020"}

{"title":"It's fairly entertaining, but different from previous Star Trek","review":"If you are looking for the usual Star Trek series then you might be disappointed by this. I'd recommend you watch The Orville (it's great) instead\/also, which is clearly a tribute (with added humour) to the old Star Trek series written writers who were fans\/Trekkies themselves.Star Trek: Picard seems to be Star Trek that grew up and became older, a bit slower, more pretentious and is definitely influenced by the lead Patrick Stewart, an accomplished actor that probably wanted\/demanded a more challenging and adult role.It looks like the writers were swayed away from the usual Star Trek recipe to make something a bit more unique and less main stream, with a hint of French vineyard.","rating":"7\/10","date":"22 February 2020"}
{"title":"Very Authentic to the series","review":"I find this series as good as it gets. The attention to details of the past is VERY good with just enough \"new\" both in tech and people to bridge the 15 years since Picard had retired and of course the cameo appearances from both Next Gen and Voyager to make it a plausible scenario. Oh yes, and I love the theme music it is fantastic.","rating":"9\/10","date":"10 March 2020"}
{"title":"Thank you for turning the show around","review":"This was one rollercoaster of a first season. A season that arrived at new low points not only for Star Trek, but for Sci-Fi in general. There were times I wanted to throw my remote at the TV. The writing was just so horrible.But this is an instance where they turned the show around. The story picked up pace at Episode 6 and remained exciting all the way to the end. It was an enjoyable and (with some flaws) true-to-its-nature Star Trek. I watched every episode of every ST series and every single movie and I am finally convinced Picard and Discovery should be allowed to continue and build. STNG wasn't built in a day either. This one just took even longer to launch. But I'm sure it will be worth watching Season 2. Tuning out with a solid 7 of 10.","rating":"7\/10","date":"27 March 2020"}
{"title":"Don't waste your time! (based on the viewing of Episode 1 and 2 No Spoilers)","review":"I like Alison Pill as an Actress and Isa Briones looked promising. As for Patrick Stewart: If he read the Phonebook I would still come and see what it is about.\nSo Cast-wise it is actually good.\nI am a year long Trek Fan, with heavy focus on the movies 1 through 6, TNG and DS9.My attitude is give everything a fair chance first. So even though I am severely disappointed by Discovery (clearly not Star Trek), I still wanted to give Picard a honest try. Those are 90 minutes I am not getting back.Not giving any of the plot away (to which I also could add plenty of criticism) my critiques are as follows:\nThe Visuals are nice, but JJ Trek lense flare heavy.\nThe people act like present day people, not like the educated, well mannered Federation we are used to, and they cuss too.\nThe Plotpoints do not make sense both lore-wise or logic-wise. Unless you like overdramatised mystery box hunting, with probably no payoff.\nThe dialogues are atrocious. We are talking soapiest of soap opera style. Same for the way the motivation of characters is executed.\nThe political situation makes no sense at all.If you like flashy stuff, want to relax and not care about Star Trek, this is the show for you. Otherwise avoid it like the Plague.","rating":"1\/10","date":"30 January 2020"}
{"title":"Action, Intrigue and a Homecoming","review":"So far I'm absolutely loving this series. It is only 2 episodes in but so far so great! I often have trouble focusing on shows and am easily distracted but I'm glued to my seat with each episode.

Can't wait for the next episode!","rating":"10\/10","date":"5 February 2020"}

{"title":"Kurtzman defiles a classic character now","review":"This show resembles one of the more boring Next Gen movies except even slower, darker, and less like Star Trek than ever before.

Don't waste your time.","rating":"1\/10","date":"22 February 2020"}

If people new to star trek watched the old versions they would turn off, this is upto date and modern.I would have given it 10 if there was the Borg in it more.

{"title":"Better than Discovery that's for sure","review":"We had avoided this for a while because of all the nerd rage over it, but finally began watching it this past weekend. It's not the worst Trek. It has that going for it. It feels a little more true than the other one. Not great as TNG overall, but better than most Wesley-centric episodes. It does suffer from the same slogginess of just having a single episode stretched out over 10 that seems to be the fashion now with everything on streaming services. This whole generation of writers pretty much suck at telling a story with anything approaching brevity. Lots of long winded exposition on things like cooking pizza that we really don't want to watch. And for all of the former TNG alum showing up... LAY OFF THE FREAKING BOTOX PEOPLE! Jeeze it's enough to give us nightmares. You're getting old, roll with it.","rating":"7\/10","date":"27 April 2020"}
{"title":"It went woke and disrespected ICE agents","review":"When the show got away from Sci-Fi and started portraying ICE agents as evil, I stopped watching.

{"title":"Loved It","review":"I found many of the reviews a bit whiny from those who wanted more of the same. I wondered if they even finished watching the first season before writing a review. Well, I just finished the first season and I loved the way it ended. It ended with hope, it gave me goose bumps. It was a happy ending.I would have liked for Data's conscience to come back for next season in some way but we all know how much he wanted to be human and humans can't live forever. It was nice to see him again.I'm okay with the new crew, especially Santiago Cabrera (Captain Crist\u221a\u2265bal \"Chris\"). He is especially easy on the eyes. I like Isa Briones (Soji) also, I think her character will bring some kick ass action in the future. To me, Picard is still Picard. Some have complained he is spoken down to by some of the woman from Starfleet but I see it as an opportunity to take these bad apples down in future episodes. He is forever a gentleman.I'm old enough to remember watching the original ST and spin off shows and I don't think the new series disrespects the older shows in any way.I looked at it as an origin story for the next chapter and I can't wait to see where it goes. Hopefully where no man has gone before.","rating":"10\/10","date":"26 March 2020"}

{"title":"I never give a 10 of 10 until today","review":"Hey everyone, I hope you're enjoying the new show. This is no discovery... Both the first and second episode were creatively cinematically stunning and the scripts and acting was more than what was promised by Patrick Stewart himself. So far this makes up for discovery 10 times over.I said to myself Wile watching the show that this looks like the best sci-fi I have ever seen. It's the attention to detail as we've never seen before. Of course we love Picard so much he brings a sense of loyalty somehow to the show. But the other actors are doing impressive work. Good direction. I am not dissatisfied in any way I found both episodes far exceeding my expectations. How often do I say that about a TV show? I am impressed.","rating":"10\/10","date":"31 January 2020"}

{"title":"Picard same or new?","review":"Disclaimer only watched first episode.Picard is back in \"action\" he might be old and retired, which is what this show is about, it's different from most of the other star trek shows where we follow a captain or inspiring person in star fleet doing heroic deeds exploring, combating new menaces almost every episode, here we follow a hearthwarming man in his old age, trying to figure out his place in the universe.\nIn many of the shows we have seen admirals, they call the shots, what does retirement look like? picard always been rational and maybe more humane towards other species or entities then any of the other show captains, this is what the show is about, we are tossed into the story with a retired picard. stuff has happened, star fleet is not the same anymore, is Picard? time will tell.I would say the script is not bad yet not great either, but why picard cares about the story that unfolds is due to his nature, as long as you can understand and accept the premise, for why the main character do what he does, I can live with bad writing.\nI like how the show gives you so many flashbacks and memories of shows you have watched before, this I liked in the trailer, and was delivered in first episodeto sum up Picard always been a favourite for me, him being frail and not doing action as much, does not take away anything from his character, what i loved about him was always his compassion and human side, i would have wished though they would not have made him this frail, but it all comes to how they will use it later on, and if we get more backstory, as if it will be of more concern for me","rating":"9\/10","date":"24 January 2020"}
{"title":"Picard series, initial impression = 7","review":"After 2 episodes, an initial rating of 7 has at least 1 point of nostalgia or maybe 2. I have enjoyed Patrick Stewart's performances for years and will watch the series for that reason alone but he is looking a little old here. The premise is interesting, Alison Pill is another fine talent and the production values are OK but somewhat budget constrained.The Next Generation series of Star Trek that gave us Picard started slowly, the first few episodes having stiff performances. The characters soon developed however and gave the audience a richer experience. I hope that happens here.","rating":"7\/10","date":"3 February 2020"}
{"title":"I was tricked by the first episode","review":"When I first reviewed Episode 1 I gave it 7\/10. It was slow paced and nice world building. Also, I guess I was happy to see Picard again.Since then though this show has gone down hill so fast it is unbelievable. The next 2 episode are really boring and nothing of consequence happened. And in retrospect you should be grateful for that. Because once stuff does happen it is the worst you'll ever see.Episode 5 was so dreadful that even hardcore NuTrek fans weren't able to defend it anymore. This series has nothing to do with Star Trek anymore. Neither visually, nor the characters, nor the story and most certainly not the writing.This show is \"Star Trek\" in name only. Star Trek is dead and Alex Kurtzman will not stop dragging its corpse around in hopes of making a quick buck. There are 8 series planned for the near future and all of them will be a dark gloomy dystopia so much removed from Star Trek they might as well have made a random scifi show and just slapped the name on it - which is what they did basically anyway.","rating":"1\/10","date":"21 February 2020"}

{"title":"Don't believe the 3rd season reviews","review":"After watching the 3rd season (which I decided to do after seeing the positive reviews), I am as disappointed in this show as I was in the first two.One word from South Park can describe it: member berries.Over the course of the season they defeat 2 enemies. How is it \"all what fans of Star Trek wanted\"? What we want is a show where complex questions are asked and answered, and where the plot gets to the point in a single episode (or two if you're really low on budget).If you want more Star Trek, watch Orville. They were joking a lot in season 1, but in season 2 suddenly got dead serious. There, the formula of a serious issue per episode is back, and what you get out of that corresponds.","rating":"7\/10","date":"7 June 2023"}

{"title":"Ignore the Negative Reviews - I'm Glad I Did!","review":"I don't write reviews; I read them before deciding to watch something but, even then, they can be so very misleading, as they were in this case ...I watched season one a good while back and mistakenly thought that was it; a single season revival. I had thoroughly enjoyed it and thought that it was a nice bonus for us older fans to see one last hurrah from Jean-Luc. And that was that - or so I thought ...In a chance conversation recently, where we were comparing TV that we watch and like, my colleague said \"Picard\" and I retorted \"Yes but shame it was only one season\". That's when I discovered that there was indeed more.The terrible reviews nearly stopped me from bothering so download season 2 but I reasoned that they have been \"wrong\" before and so I ploughed on regardless. And I am so glad that I did. It was brilliant and getting to see Seven again was a true bonus. (Yes, she has always been a fantasy woman for me - I mean, come on; resistance is futile)So here's the thing - I cannot fathom why the nay-sayers claim that it is a \"snooze-fest\". Perhaps they prefer something where people and aliens are being killed every other frame. I don't know but I LOVED it. Patrick Stewart, like Richard Burton before him, has a voice that commands that you listen.So do yourselves a favour if you are over 50 and reading this. Close IMDB and go and watch it. \"Make It So\".","rating":"10\/10","date":"13 February 2023"}
{"title":"You're all living in the past","review":"You all want this to be TNG, it's not TNG, it's something far different, it deserves to be watched as a movie not an individual episode. I wonder if anyone is viewing this as new experience or just something they want to relive from the past. I have watched all versions of Star Trek and this rates as good as any of them. In episode 5 we open with 7 of 9 having to kill Icheb, basically her son. It brought me to tears. My recommendation is stop viewing this through the expectations of the past and watch it as something new, which you don't know where it's going to end or where it's going, and that's the fun of the show. I think you all need to give the show a chance. Not to mention it was basically a pilot for the first three episodes. Leave it is nerds to not be able to enjoy anything new, you all adapt so well.","rating":"10\/10","date":"20 February 2020"}

{"title":"Un-Star Trek for Swearing!","review":"Never having seen a single episode except pics and video previews, until some days ago, I already spotted things I didn't like. It seem right off to be copying a fan made Star Trek: Renegades. Because everything was being done without Star Fleet's knowledge or approval. I didn't like most of the new cast apart from the familar TNG as it seem like the creators of the show wanted to cut corners by trying to go cheap. The variety of characters felt sort of like Guardians of the Galaxy being brought together. Only each had their own inner turmoil going on, along with problems that couldn't be fixed or resolved. It seemed everyone else couldn't keep their head on straight except Picard. The only new character I liked and found interesting is Soji. Picard having amazing profound impact on others was something too. I didn't like Hugh dying, as he was one of those good characters that shouldn't have been killed off. Other than Soji and of the others I wouldn't of mind being gone. There are three things I felt right off that is wrong, especially when it comes to that far in the future. Picard and Riker's homes looked too much like impoverished living of the 1920's or 30's. Nothing futuristic by that. By then old fashion book pages won't be made out of paper but some kind of durable, lasting plastic. The aging disease will be gone and people will look like in their 20's or 30's and live longer than 100. There was no need for swearing and is unlike Star Trek to have such. We're talking about a better more promising future for humanity, where sloppy, uneducated talking like that will no longer exist or matter. It will be gone like some passing fad. The damaging thing about putting swear words in a show is it kills the means for most to not want to see it over and over. It's like mixing trash into quality viewing.","rating":"7\/10","date":"11 July 2021"}

{"title":"A fun and very familiar start","review":"S1E1 of *Star Trek: Picard* (PIC) was seen and that season is certainly for a different time and generation. The plot and script, pandering to a particular audience which didn't care about Star Trek, failed to generate interest to continue watching S1 and altogether skip S2, despite some excellent production values in this first episode.All of which Paramount obviously knew. So in order to bring in ratings it looked to what worked for this final season of PIC. Mindful of the response 2022's *Top Gun: Maverick* (TGM) brought in theaters, PIC S3E1 succeeded in reaching out to more viewers by blatantly incorporating 1982's *Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan* into The Next Generation (TNG), using the same excellent production values of S1E1 and bringing in familiar - at least to some - TNG cast.And so far that plagiarism is presented very well. Hopefully future episodes of S3 are as entertaining as this one. At least a few of them combined will hopefully make for a great IMAX film, just as TGM is.","rating":"7\/10","date":"17 February 2023"}

{"title":"Good show but far from perfect","review":"Stewart crushes it as he returns to the Picard role and the story is intriguing and exciting. It can feel a little drug out at times but it keeps with a lot of the themes that make Star Trek Star Trek. The cast is great and the callbacks to TNG are nice. I have no complaints about the look or style of the show, except for the excess lens flare ripped straight from JJ. Other than that it looks great. That said it also feels, at times, dumbed down a bit. The addition of blood and cussing was unnecessary as well. I have the mouth of a sailor but it's not needed and it feels out of place. It feels more like a show written by people who watched Star Trek but didn't really like it or get it. It's good and I am excited to see where it goes, I just wish someone would tell the writers they aren't nearly as edgy or shocking as they believe they are. Also, and I know it's not over yet and the message could change but Star Trek is about hope and so far we've only been given cynicism.","rating":"7\/10","date":"3 February 2020"}
{"title":"The WORST of all resurrected franchises. Literally big budget fan fiction.","review":"First, I never write reviews here, but I felt compelled because PICARD is just that bad. The show isn't even consistent from episode to episode! It's so obvious the showrunners aren't familiar with the history and tone of the source material. It's clear they only know how to write \"dystopian nightmare\" and nothing else. With S02E01, I dismissed this series in the bin of fan fiction. Whoopie Goldberg appeared in 29 episodes of Star Trek TNG and they never once made mention of her race. The irony of PICARD'S showrunners trying to use Guinan to make a statement about racism when the 1990's show simply treated Guinan as her own strong, unique character. Imagine that?","rating":"1\/10","date":"6 April 2022"}
{"title":"Season 3 is what you are looking for","review":"I hated first season and I could not bother watching second one, then I gave it a try on a 3rd season...I don't know what happened, but the writers suddnely started writing a decent Star Trek at least on TNG Films level...It feels like there was main writer's assistant which knew Star Trek lore inside out there in a crew somewhere which was only allowed to assist during first two seasons of this show and when the director realized show is getting cancelled, they allowed the assistant to write it full time because who cares anyway...So suddenly a fan of Star Trek started writing a show based on his knowledge of Star Ttek Lore and it all started to make sense, at least that's what it feels like...About the actual Season 3...You get a whole bunch of TNG guest appearances, damn even Ro Laren is here and they all do something intresting, they all are nicely integrated into story...I am not gonna spoil anything but the best scenes and story are very well crafted with a decent inspiration from Wrath of Khan and DS9... As a Star Trek Fan which seen whole TNG DS9 Voyager I can say confirm this is a very decent story full with TNG characters, yup, one could even say it's an 8th season of TNG you been waiting for...","rating":"8\/10","date":"18 April 2023"}

{"title":"Overall - Disappointed in the season","review":"I watched the complete first season of Star Trek: Picard twice. I gave myself a break between viewings to see if my opinion has varied. I am still giving the series an overall rating of a 7 out of 10. It's Trek for the 2020's.HIGHS\nDelightful to see members of the original TNG cast being permitted to age gracefully. The back story for Troi was outstanding. It was great to see Hugh, too. Bringing Voyagers Seven into the plot was pure genius, and again, allowing the character to mature was superbly done. The show runners for these latest incarnations of the Trek universe did an okay job of making the season a story arc. The episodes built off each other. The Romulan baddies were great, and the homage to the TOS Romulan atmospheric music was GREAT!MEDIUMS\nThe series was amply cast. Jonathan Frakes was acting like Jonathan Frakes in a television show - coming off as somewhat wooden; forced. Also, the use of flashbacks was starting to get a bit annoying. Would have been nice if they could have just told those parts of the story up front.LOWS\nAfter watching it two times through, I was still unable to connect several dots and had to just \"go with the plot\". Absolutely did NOT like the finale with Picard's conscious being placed inside an android - I thought that was a complete let down. This is set in what? The 24th Century? They end up on a planet of androids and positronic brains more advanced than what was in Data. You mean they could not fix Picards brain? And then that whole \"We didn't give you ANY upgrades!\" That made no sense, unless that is to be a plot device in Season 2.SEASON TWO\nPicard has unresolved mommy issues? Really? I am so annoy with this plot line. He's a God Damned Star Fleet Captain \/ Admiral! He had a F-ing (half) Betazoid SHIPS COUNCILOR onboard his FLAGSHIP, was ASSIMILATED BY THE BORG and RESCUED and not ONCE in ANY of his Command evaluations or time with Troi did ANY OF THAT SURFACE? WTF are the writers doing here? This is bullshit! DISAPPOINTED!!!","rating":"7\/10","date":"2 February 2020"}
{"title":"I love it - but I see a twist","review":"This may contain spoilers. From the very first episode I have had a strong feeling that this story line is related to a mystery that exists from star trek voyager and star trek first contact and that is why the borg queen died twice and we were never given an explanation. I think this story is the beginning and end for star trek, it explains why the borg queen could die twice, because she is a twin, created in the future and not the past. The borg can do time travel in their sleep, so it's no stretch of the imagination to think the borg queen(s) are made in the future. Data after all had the borg Queen drilling around in his head, who is to say the plans were not inserted into his memory. I think this storyline is developing into the ultimate storyline that explains everything. So looking forward to seeing if I am right. But won't be disappointed if I am wrong, its been gory but that aside a good come back.","rating":"10\/10","date":"8 March 2020"}
{"title":"What Star Trek Discovery was meant to be","review":"The first season of \"Star Trek Picard\" is what \"Star Trek Discovery\" missed to become: an adult version of a Star Trek saga with a complex story and logic to character's decisions and actions. To those who were disappointed not to find the clich\u221a\u00a9 racist cheasy elements by Frakes in this series: please do not compare \"STP\" with the \"ST The Next Generation\". Rather watch the original original with W. Shatner and you find a much darker and serious elements and therefore more similarities (especially with the movies).The second season started off much better than the first one, but went downhill towards the end.

When Warf showed up, looking amazing BTW, I had tears in my eyes.The negative aspects however, are pretty distracting. First of all: the dark look of the ship board environment, the odd camera angles and the general chaotic filming style during action sequences don'tappeal to me. Next Gen had a bright look to it, the lighting, the ship, the general ambience; then the prequels had a darker look. Now, we are post Next Gen and the Star Trek world is back to dark? The look and style is totally ST Discovery, of which I am not a fan.The new cast members are great. I love Ed Speelers and have been a fan since I first saw him on Downton Abbey. As for the character, Jack Crusher, I just don't understand how Beverly's son (who grew up with her, in Space) has a London accent and says things like Bob's your Uncle\/Fanny's your Aunt.. it's just weird.Overall - rating down to 8 from 10.S2- I just watched the Season Finale - wow~! Amazing how ST continues to evolve and grow and still provide an entertaining series while at its heart lies the essence of what we love in the world so brilliantly created by Mr. Roddenberry. It is not a perfect world, and while hunger and poverty were conquered on Earth, it's still a crazy universe. The characters (I'll admit, I had my misgivings) have become, for me, a cohesive crew where each one contributes something unique, where there is loyalty and the beginnings of greater and deeper emotions. Picard told Data at the end, that he loved him. For all the sci-fi in this science fiction, it's that - the love, loyalty, sacrifice, redemption - all these themes play out and take us along to a place where in the end, the message was so simply - kindness matters. We do not need to be the same, or believe the same things, or share the same politics, but if we can be kind, then our world is a better place - maybe a place a bit more like the one Star Trek envisioned, and the one of which it has encouraged us to dream. For people who rate this a 1, I think there is something about Star Trek they missed, right from the start. :-)","rating":"8\/10","date":"26 March 2020"}
{"title":"Rating is based on season 1","review":"Season 1 was decent. Not what I was hoping for but okay nonetheless. It was nice to see the story continued and Picard back in action. I still can't buy into the Romulans though. Starfleet is also a completely different entity than they have been previously portrayed. No longer a shining example to the galaxy they're a petty political POS organization. Something you'd expect in our day, not hundreds of years in the future in the age of a more enlightened humankind.For season 2 I was very excited to see Q coming back. But what a mess it turned out to be. They crapped all over The Next Generation series. It made little sense, and claiming the Borg queen was the way she is because she's just lonely? Sheesh... Did these writers even watch Star Trek? I doubt it. I think they're of the crowd who is all proud they never watched it so they wouldn't be influenced and instead put their own personal spin on it, and in doing so left a big streaming pile all over Star Trek fans of the 90s. I would classify it as non-canonical junk. Guinan's story line doesn't jive either, they completely messed up. They rewrote her backstory and changed her from the kind and wise person she used to be to an angry racial activist.Of special special note regarding the series as a whole, Allison Pill just sucks so incredibly much. She and Michelle Hurd really dragged down the show.Maybe I'm generous in my rating because I'm a fan of Patrick Stewart's Star Trek, which this struggles to be related to. I would never pay Paramount to watch the show but I saw it for free so that tempers my criticism. At least it's better than that travesty of a show called Discovery. To hell with that mess!If the current trajectory is any indication, season 3 will have everyone hugging the Borg while singing Kumbaya...","rating":"7\/10","date":"9 September 2022"}
{"title":"Thank you","review":"To all the reviewers who took the time to be disappointed here. Broadly, they're all correct. Sometimes, that's all the protest we have.Sir Patrick, I grew up on you in the captain's chair. I saw you on Bdway 4 times. You deserved better.The show gets a few stars for the production value. Sometimes, that's all that's left.","rating":"4\/10","date":"14 February 2020"}
{"title":"Season 3, full of nostalgia","review":"Season 1 is bad.Season 2 is even worse.But Season 3 is the closest to what Star Trek should be than anything we've seen in the past decade.Sure, there's no exploration (the main theme of TNG), some lines are inconsistent to what we know about the characters in TNG and the plot is definitely rushed.But the writers did manage to catch some of that old TNG spirit we've all been longing for in the past two decades. And the last episode is a fitting end to an era which (in my opinion) should never have ended. The actors and the fact that the triggered a rather powerful emotional response in me are the reasons for which I increased my rating from 1, to 9.PS: By the way, you can just watch Season 3 without bothering to watch the previous two season. They are little better than the junk that Discovery is anyway.","rating":"9\/10","date":"16 February 2020"}

Okay, could be improvement looking at the \"bad\" women.\nMeeting with Family \"Riker\" best Show!!! Emotions, Pictures TNG Feeling and I was \"at Home\" Thanks for that.

{"title":"A really good series vs. hurt fanboy-feelings","review":"'Picard' is beautifully crafted - visually, storywise and in terms of character. It works with a lot of emotion (without beeing cheesy) and some complex characters, a thoughtful woven story and a lot more action than you would guess by reading all those reviews here. It may be slow paced, while taking its time to unravel its story arc, but in a good way, giving you time to experience it, build up immersion, feel with the characters and struggle with them. And that is something this series can do way better than good old TNG.It is just darker, grittier, with deeper, more \"real\" charakters without leaving Star Trek credibility behind . Infact it is way more ST than 'Discovery' or the J. J. Abrahms Movies. (yes, suckers ^^ - think about it)I wanted to give it a nine, but before it gets crushed into oblivion by all these bad critics, i had to give it a ten out of ten ;)So from one oldimer to the others:\nThe 80s and 90s are gone - cope with it. Good sci-fy reflects the present, and as 'TNG' had this naive (end of cold war) optimism, when we watched it as children or teenagers - 'Picard' is the cynical grown up version of today. This series is really good, you can see that they really cared by making this show. So discard your childhood-memory nostalgia and give it a chance. Get out of your trekky bubble, be grown ups, brush these hurted little-fanboy-feelings aside, watch it and think again. Cheers!","rating":"10\/10","date":"18 March 2020"}
{"title":"Like Season 1, 2 & 3 of TNG......","review":"I'm really undecided on Picard..........Lets start with the positives1. Whilst this is a positive it could be seen as a negative....... Its not season 8 of TNG and so with that its different........ but I'm not sure I like the fact Starfleet have turned on Picard... Maybe he will save the day again and be the hero that everyone loves.\n2. It will be interesting to see where the storyline will pick up and I hope it develops. I love the fact that Stewart is back, there are glimpses of the old Enterprise, Riker is to comeback etc. All of the other actors are greatNegatives\n1. This is no reflection on this or TNG but the last TNG film was so why they have decided to carry on this storyline.. I have no idea........ I would have loved a star trek 3 idea where they go back in time to rescue data or something along those lines.\n2. Its taking a long-time to develop this story.......... i'm hanging on with the sheer hope that it starts to accelerate to warp speed!\n3. Whilst ive praised some of the characters coming back some off them are unexplained....... Why Hugh\/actor is back I have no idea... Why 7 is back... I don't know.....\n4. I just hope this doesn't turn into Discovery. I completely hate this show, Its ripped the entire Star Trek universe up..... its just utter spot!!!\n5. Ok so I may sound old with this comment but I hate the swearing in this show... they did it in Insurrection with RIker said get the bastards!!! You don't need to do it. TNG never did and its still with DS9 one of the best Star Trek shows.....Lets just see how this goes..................","rating":"7\/10","date":"15 February 2020"}
{"title":"Everyone has an expiration date","review":"Having been a Star Trek fan for decades, was so hopeful for a new Star Trek series. Picard has as much to do with \"Star Trek\" as a frozen TV dinner has to do with a gourmet meal. The characters are flat, and lack the chemistry with each other that was always evident in all the other Star Treks. Suffered through the first 4 episodes & had to pull the plug. Sir Stewart please retire, Ms. Ryan you deserve better than this silly wanna be sci-fi .","rating":"1\/10","date":"22 February 2020"}

{"title":"NOT a bad show...","review":"Many reviewers here called this bad show and gave it a one star reviews. WTF? I liked it. It's not as good as TNG but I didn't expect it to be either. The story is engaging, production values are top notch, and most of the acting is up to par. On the negative side, some of the characters I didn't care for, especially the one who called Picard by the nickname JL, but that's a minor nit - almost every Star Trek series has characters I don't care for. Overall, this was worth watching and memorable, even if it's not the best Star Trek series in the canon (but not the worst either - I'd give that dubious honor to Enterprise). But what do I know? I've only been a fan for 52 years or so. And I can easily live with some blue language and a darker universe than Gene Roddenberry's originally envisioned.","rating":"7\/10","date":"18 April 2020"}
{"title":"I am surprised by the 8.4 rate","review":"I am quite disappointed with this Star Trek. I found the script\/story below average, as a matter of fact the script is so bad that at the end of the 4th episode they bring Seven of Nine (which is from the spin off \"Star Trek: Voyager\" by the way...) in the hope that she will help to keep viewer.I am done with that series, it was painful\/boring to watch it.","rating":"2\/10","date":"17 February 2020"}
{"title":"For a first episode it is really well done 8\/10.","review":"In short:\nThis isn't the tight knit quarters of the previous series, but unless you're an idiot that is not where a show starts when it picks up old threads again.\nThe mystery that someone pointed out is missing, is there - there are some revelations that are likely to bring back old characters that are shown but not properly pulled (this is with US market in mind).\nThe CGI is very good (one step down from the late Star Trek movies), the martial arts and gunfights not so much, which can be ok in a sci-fi like this as compensation can lie in all the technology the viewer does not get to \"see\".Pros:\nInvowen threads of plot mechanics, emotional uplay with progressive human philosophy woven in and the budget\/effects are acedCon's\nMartial arts\/gunfight coordination\nSome of the CGI & effects (teleportation needs to be honed in to suit light wise, space needs more contrast, maybe not ad soundeffects in space, the superman connotations intentionally drawn)End notes:\nI disagree with that Pactrick Stewart is too old to have the lead part, though it begs the question for how long he can hold it.","rating":"8\/10","date":"23 January 2020"}

{"title":"I'm glad the show Picard exists..","review":"And yes, it's a sad story. Axanar's violent cessation (which, in my opinion, was a real Star Trek after a long time, instead of a polished disaster called Discovery).\nPicard: It's not as bad as Discovery. And for that I am really happy.\nTherefore, I do not mind the distopical future, nor the fact that the world is darker while there is someone struggling for the old ideals of the Federation. I do not mind that the story is slow (ST always not was like StarWars.. :)).\nI like the performances of some actors and a subtle hint of a return of humor (thanks to Alison Pill) to StarTrek (which I missed since TOS (with some exceptions :-)). I can go through a technically not very developed future (StarTrek has always been prophetic about technology development). I still expect characters to evolve in difficult situations, in times of conflict between beliefs and pressure of circumstances.\nI hate some scenes that seem terribly outdone (transporting Picard to the planet the little boy is watching, transporting Elnor, who puts his sword in during the transport (and looks more like an elf from the Lord of the Rings (well, they probably want to attract viewers and elsewhere ..), Picard shots from different angles when transporting the seventh out of nine .. etc.\nStill ... I'm trying to keep a positive look. There is still a chance that the series will have an idea. So I can always reduce the number of stars in the \"darker\" future. :-))","rating":"10\/10","date":"20 February 2020"}
{"title":"Almost but not quite","review":"Picard is almost really good, but some of the dialogue is too drawn out and long, I find myself often wanting them to get to the point. Picard himself looks a bit frail at times and probably will not be in many fight scenes, plus the story inside the story can also be annoying, please just give us a nice clear plot, too many twists becomes annoying. The production values are excellent and when it gets going it will make for great action scenes.I'm only up to Ep3 so it's just getting going, it has the foundations of great TV.","rating":"7\/10","date":"8 February 2020"}

Riker back without some explanation that he had ether went off and married Wolff or was consumed by the Borg and leading these black suites.. Also where's Counselor Deanna Troi who could see the future and why not start the film with Picard leaving Star fleet for defending the whole of the galaxy, along with 1\/2 the human population (apparently)But as a Picard fan I will watch with hope that Riker and Troi will grace the Amazon screen and make it true generations :)","rating":"7\/10","date":"27 January 2020"}
{"title":"Ridiculous","review":"I stopped watching Star Trek after Nemesis. Since I had a free Paramount Plus subscription, I decided to give Picard a chance.The show is an almost totally preposterous train wreck.As of most of television today, the show has too much melodrama. Everyone has a problem. Normal people don't exist or considered too boring.Was it necessary to give Raffi a drug dependency problem and her son having issues? No its just filler as was Picard having a terminal disease\/dying\/coming back in a synthetic body subplotPoor continuity. Guinan and Picard met in the 19th century according to TNG. Picard's writers decided to ignore this so we can have drama here. Unnecessary. Picard and Guinan combing forces a second time before the 24th century would have been good enough.Don't get me started on Dr. Adam Soong. Is he a scientist or a warlord? The scene with him coming up with a army of mercenaries plus the scene where it is discovered he has drones ready to destroy Europa had me ready to laugh hysterically.Raffi risking the universe to save Seven. Please......Wasn't there some kind of warning not to tamper with people and things in 2024 because that could affect the future. Shooting up a bunch of mercenaries and a whole boatload of other actions makes that pointless.I could write more but to say Picard is a terribly written television show is just fine.","rating":"1\/10","date":"10 June 2022"}
{"title":"Outstanding in every possible way","review":"So much better than I thought it would be.And my expectations were high.I'll start with the people who won't like it: it doesn't have a lot of \"action\", although there are some very creative fight sequences. There are not a lot of space battles either, but the few they have are essential to the plot.Visually, it is beautifully designed, directed and filmed: pastoral countryside sequences; the bright and cheerful \"graphite and glitter\" of futuristic San Francisco and Starfleet buildings; the bleak, dark and moody aspects of interstellar travel. All the disparate pieces hold together somehow in an off-balance way that keeps the viewer paying close attention.As you would expect from a series with Sir Patrick at the center, it is character-driven. As we are introduced to new characters we are shown the explanation of how each one fits into Picard's current and past life. Some will find this exposition slow, but people who watch Star Trek for the characters will enjoy this depth of backstory. Real fans who are accustomed to Star Trek's casual relationship with the unidirectional nature of the time continuum will have no problem following the related flashbacks.All in all, I am predicting the reboot fans won't like it, and folks with a Kirk fixation from ST:TOS won't like it either.But the acting is superb. I can't think of anyone who gives a bad performance. The writing is so magnificent I found myself making notes of well turned phrases I wanted to remember and savor. The plot is not simple enough for a casual viewer, but it is nicely complicated and fresh in a way that will be very satisfying to folks who have been absorbing the ins and outs of Roddenberry's vision for decades.It is morally complex in the way that the best Trek episodes are, with the grey areas of good guys\/bad guys taking twists at just the right times. The Federation political intrigue and parallels to current world situations are very well done. And there are constant references to morsels of information and favorite people from the rest of the Star Trek universe that dedicated and observant fans will notice with delight.So if your favorite episodes from the Star Trek universe are the ones that blend the science and action elements with the infinite complexity and intensity of human drama, and if you realize the greatest unknown to explore is the realm of emotion, memory and the experiences that make life most precious, then Season One of Picard will hit you in the gut in a powerful and unforgettable way.Last but not least, if you are already an admirer of Sir Patrick Stewart, and acknowledge Jean-Luc Picard as the best Captain in Starfleet, it is criminal that you have not seen this already.Clear a weekend for watching the first season as though it were a trilogy of feature-length movies. Do it ASAP.This series alone is worth the cost of a Paramount Plus subscription.","rating":"10\/10","date":"8 June 2021"}

{"title":"A Challenge to IMDb","review":"UPDATE After Watching Season 2:So, I down rated Picard and am sad to say, Season 2 was absolutely awful. After watching the brilliance of Season 1, I eagerly awaited Season 2 to see where the crew went after the stunning conclusion to Season 1. What happened? Did ALL of the main people except the crew leave this show? Season 1 left us wondering with anticipation about our heroes future as Picard ended it with a smile and an \"engage,\" (or whatever, number 2 was so bad, I am going to make this short. Rather not spend any more time on this one!) Instead? We got a messy, disjointed story which was nearly stand alone. Meaning, you didn't even have to watch Season 1 to understand 2. Sloppy, lazy, rambling, messy. JMHO. I have never in my life seen a show shoot itself in the gut (metaphorically speaking, naturally), by having so much potential and then, throwing it all away with too much emotion and dull, disjointed plots in the sequel. I sure would like to know what happened to the people behind the scenes to have one amazing season, and then trash the whole story on us. Star Trek deserves far, far better than this, and Discovery. It's like nobody even watched TNG, or Deep Space 9, or even Voyager. It saddens me a lot that these shows are what the younger generation will remember of the original series. Progress seems to be running rampant throughout the U. S. A. Sometimes, in many things today, progress runs against what many Americans want. But who cares about us? Most of us work hard and have huge, complicated situations going on in our private lives. We watch TV to relish the escapism of the stories. I wish Hollywood got this! I also wish you (Paramount) had watched over this 2nd Season filming and kicked their lazy butts for taking what had great potential and smashing that potential to pieces. So, so sad!Original Post 4\/2021:A \"doddering\" old man? Boring? Why why why? These are called talking points when you see the same words written over and over again In the first scroll down on the reviews of Picard. I smell a rat. And that rat is not Picard, but an ageist anti-Star Trek group working hard to bring down the ratings of this fine show.When the reviewing began a year ago, it was mixed, for sure. But I could not find an end to these similarly written rotten reviews of a show that was actually very good. I am asking IMDb to look into this, please? If you refine your search and set it for seeing only reviews of 10, it is still in the highest category. Which implies there were fair reviews at one time, but NOT NOW. Where there is smoke there is fire and I believe there has been an invasion of some sort of twisted group organized, for whatever reasons, to take out Picard. These reviews are short, with very little detail given except what I wrote at the beginning. These people are not real reviewers - they appear to be part of a group, who have no idea HOW to write a proper review unless talking points are handed out. This is not fair to the show and especially to those who did REAL reviews on a very good show.I have read many reviews on many movies and shows in here and never have I seen the barrage of similar 1 and 2 star reviews that completely sucked the air out of the reviewing process. Let's try to get to the bottom of this, OK? Picard was not perfect, no show is. But it was NOT boring, and that \"doddering\" old man was meant to be played that way by Sir Patrick because he was deeply depressed in the beginning. You all needed to watch the series to the end to really see the brilliance of this new Star Trek entry.And, um, I thought Millenials were \"woke.\" They appear to be written by 6th graders. And I also thought they were against hate and nastiness. I think maybe I got a view of a younger generation without respect, or the ability to be honest. A 10 rating for Picard - the entire first season, had any of these reviewers watched it or done even a little research, was to set up an exciting new story for the rest of the series which this group is hell-bent on heading off at the pass. A sad commentary of humanity once again as U. S. borders are overwhelmed, our statues are falling and our cities are burning, the police defunded, and people are moving away from the messy areas in record numbers.I am quite frankly more heartbroken at the evil words written over and over again as far as I scrolled, than what these evil words were trying to accomplish. When will the hatred, the lying, the fear, and group thinking end? Or have we seen the end of individual thought? Please, people, I think that onslaught was meant to silence those of us who loved Picard. We cannot allow them to seize Picard like they are trying to do with so many traditions and values this country always stood for.

For me Picard is feeling more like the familiar Trek territory that I love. I'm interested in this storyline and the new characters have all grown on me at this point.

{"title":"There's hope for this show... I think","review":"Yes, many people here are complaining that this show has strayed from the original style of Star Trek. They are correct, but I don't think that has to be a bad thing. If you want to just watch reruns of TOS and The Next Generation, those are available to you. If you're offended by cursing, then stay away from this show (and most anybody over the age of 12 these days). If it agitates you to see a man getting beat up by a woman, that's probably more about you than the show and you should probably seek therapy.That's not to say that it's been a great show, thus far, by any means. Honestly, I'm drained from watching. Episode one was good--a little strife, intrigue, mystery. Episode 2, 3 and 4, however, are basically Picard reuniting with a character from his past who is enraged at him for trying his best to do his job. Ok, we get it, toes were stepped on. Do we have to dedicate 25% of each episode to Picard apologizing and reiterating his decision-making process?BUT, my hope is that after all this tiresome set-up of characters has been completed, the show will return to the promise of the first episode. But, for sure, if you absolutely have to have The Next Generation 2.0, where the good guys and bad guys are clearly delineated, where hope and prosperity is all that is in store for the human race and the Federation, where manners always trump emotion, keep moving, this isn't your show.","rating":"6\/10","date":"17 February 2020"}
{"title":"Star Trek Picard has a Star Wars problem","review":"Let me explain that one, in case it isn't clear:\nStar Wars has a huge galaxy and thousands of worlds and races to work with, and yet the same half dozen characters keep getting trotted out film after film. It's dreadfully dull. You've got an entire galaxy to work it, use it!Likewise here with Picard (have only started watching Season 3 because I heard it was an improvement over 1 and 2) they bring back all the old gang and they just look....old and tired.Yeah Patrick Stewart is. 83, so I get it, but everyone else they've brought back so far seem far older than their years and going through the motions. Only Franks seems to be enjoying the role again, everyone else acts like they are in it only for a paycheck.Ok, so bad acting aside, how's the plot? Well...it certain is a soap opera set in space. Everyone is full of drama and doubt and of course has some kind of ulterior motive. The writers are trying to do some kind of \"Dark Trek\" and make it gritty and noir but honestly it's not working. Sure the TOS and NG were all shiny happy people and that needed some moderation but \"Emo Trek\" is not working..dial it back a bit guys.Only three episodes in, but I'm not sure I'll last many more. Sorry gang, better luck next time.","rating":"2\/10","date":"3 March 2023"}

{"title":"Maybe is not that bad after all, but is bad, but I will watch it anyway","review":"I really hopped for the iconic majestic Picard figure to return with this new iteration of the Star Trek. He is old man after all, I can't blame him for losing his charisma. The most I don't like about this show is the fundamental use of the modern approach in filmmaking, all of that smooth fade transitions and dramatic music is too much for me. The action scenes are that worse part were the camera is all shaky while is following the motion in every step, missing the big picture.\nAnd Data could be deep faked on this actor face, even being good match does not have his Brendan's facial expressions.I will watch this, even if is structured like any other shameful lacking creativity, blurring cheap tricks show, just because it tries to deliver. At the point where the viewer is curious what will happen the next time and the next moment, this show will succeed. But is quite bad after all, there is no excuses for the directors and writers not doing their homework to deliver some of the feeling of The Next Generation.","rating":"7\/10","date":"28 January 2020"}

It employs a sense of nostalgia from all the previous years yet with it's own story and set of characters. Personally I think they did a great job, the visuals, production value and overall tone of the show. Give it a real shot and you won't be disappointed!","rating":"10\/10","date":"18 January 2022"}

{"title":"Started off with an interesting concept","review":"...but...this is not the Star Trek we've grown to love over the last 55 years. It has interesting characters that we quickly hate after a few episodes. This show goes nowhere fast and is laced with more than acceptable profanity. I grew very bored very quickly. It's almost like the premise of 10 years of the walking dead packed into 1 season: lots of build up with no clear vision of a conclusion. Aka, an entire season of the final episode of Game of Thrones. I'm glad many of our favorite Star Trek actors turned down the \"opportunity\" to be in this crap fest. Finally, what a way to beat a dead horse (Captain Picard).","rating":"5\/10","date":"16 January 2023"}
{"title":"Season 2 is definitely better so far","review":"After watching every Star Trek series, I was so disappointed in season 1 of Picard. It felt dark and disjointed, nothing at all like previous Star Trek. What it really came down to for me was the cast felt unprofessional on top of all that: the swearing. A little swearing in shows doesn't bother me, but I would bet that Gene Roddenberry would have not allowed this in this series. It is classless and jarring after watching the earlier, stellar work of earlier Trek. In episode 1 of season 2, the writers are still putting it out there with the swearing and unprofessional attitude of the new characters. It just makes the show tasteless and just plain lazy. That being said, with veteran actors of the Next Generation series coming back along with the more interesting storyline coming, this is reminding me of Next Generation and making it even better.","rating":"8\/10","date":"3 March 2022"}
{"title":"This could be the correct post war scenario where the suspicious mind is in action.","review":"Sharing a borg cube and all the knowledge and helping the former slaves, whilst the secret service is still highly active, is what is also happen in the real world in our own history. Yes it is darker then ever and I also enjoy ST more when there is morelight and less dark drama. We have already far too many dark movies, with vampyr's monsters an undeath creatures in movies today. We need seeing some light in the future too bIn this case the episode 7 did light up the story. It would be for me a 10\/10 but there are fightscene where Patrick Stewart did a far to slow move but still the other actor did lay down and was killed.\nDon't let him fight. It looks pathetic. Picard has so much more to give, with his wisdom and age, then fighting The scene with the eye was not necessary filming close up. All together, the 7 episodes comtaining a great Star Treck adventure again.","rating":"","date":"6 March 2020"}

Well unless it livens up a bit and stops being so reflective and, to be frank, dreary I will stop watching. I love Discovery and the cast is good. I have to admit that I never was a fan of Picard in STTNG but the rest of the cast made up for it. Nothing stands out for me and the majority of the characters seem to be one-dimensional.

{"title":"Whoa, Star Trek is back!","review":"For the first time in a decade, we see Star Trek return with a genuine series that is worthy of the name! Not the confusing mix-mash of Star Trek Discovery where a battle every episode is half entertaining. What Discovery loses compared to the return of Picard is hope. Kirk and Picard's \"timeline\" has always had hope as one of its main tenets whereas S.T Discovery, even the Kelvin Timeline fails in the hope tenet.Just to see Sir Patrick Stewart back in the Picard persona was well worth getting up early UK time to catch it on Amazon Prime. Its almost as if had simply skipped the last 25 years following TNG's ending and continued where Picard continues, you wonder where the times are gone! The quality of the acting and writing is far superior to many of the \"Star Trek\" formats out there. You notice within five minutes of watching. Whether its the case of being so pleased to see Jean Luc Picard back or if its a case of simply enjoying the characters like a pair of well-worn boots. However, the constructs of the initial storyline and the Easter Egg at the end left me screaming \"NO\" at the TV, waking half the house up and looking to see when the next episode is on.Not to give spoilers out, yet the good old TNG action and storyline resumes two decades after the events of Nemesis. Picard having trouble with his dreams starts to mix reality and replaying historical events we all saw through the lifetime of TNG. Some of the old favourites are back, No.1 is still his trusty sidekick, although we can laugh at it when all said and done.In the end, superior all round, we'll worth full marks!","rating":"10\/10","date":"25 January 2020"}
{"title":"We're back to REAL Trek...!!","review":"Season 2, now I'm 47 and have been through every incarnation of the series. Although TOS and TAS was consumed after TNG.First I love the fact that we have adult actors\/actresses - but just to experience alumni from TNG - could be fatal for a show but is it?No - in my opnion there have been cared for the roles, not only do they interest me but I genuinely care about them. That tells me two things - the writers are attentive to the \"verse of Trek\" - and secondly - the stories are intertwined with shifts in momentum that literally have me shout \"OH COME ON\".Unlike Discovery - roles and actors and stories aren't force-fed by social commentary and gender-norms - so that it is free to just tell a story. Well in honesty TOS and TNG and DS9 were filled with them too - but at least it allowed the viewer to pause and reflect - and that can only happen if the stories and roles are cared for.Picard S2 is now upon us - EP1 has me absolutely spellbound. To refer to an interview with Sir Patrick, we will se Picard moving on in his life. But to keep this absolutely spoiler free - dear reader - buckle up you\u00c2\u00b4re in for a ride!Writers, actors - everyone has pulled in the reigns for a thrill - and we are back to what in my opinion is an absolute delight.","rating":"10\/10","date":"5 March 2022"}
{"title":"great, love it","review":"I love how the series captures the essence of star trek. it is not just sci-fi with cool effects but more a exploration of ourselves , contemporary world problems as well as potential future ones by projecting them onto some other time, place, races, androids and thus giving us a comfortable distance and a different perspective that hopefully enables to reach the right conclusions...A noble cause and I feel sorry for people that don't see that in this series","rating":"","date":"12 March 2020"}
{"title":"First two are hit and miss three is miss and miss Stop at 2","review":"This show has a number of very story (plot) and character ideas but it cant join them togetherI enjoyed The start of seasons one and two which have very similar but weird endings its the middle bit of both again their are some fantastic ideas and characters but joining them together falls flat on its face and like every one of the new style format USA shows it has at least one too many episodes the story is slowed down to stretch it out and a lot of plot padding addedNow if Your a TNG fan ie this is the show you loved this will not appeal similarly if you were a DS9 fan this is not for you I could see voyager fans getting this because of a fan favourite returning to the universe but I was not a huge fan of this so I could be wrongThe problem Picard has is to understand what's going on you need knowledge of the previous shows and the movies and they were to be fair and I am a fan here they weren't all good all of the time and people cant go back and watch the equivalent of 21 years of TV (not sure you need the og or the enterprise) and one sort of retecon adjacent and very controversial\/divisive movie too understand what the characters are talking about so any one who comes to it cold is baffled and those who get it have their ideas about the Trek Universe and what should and should happen and if they don't see their ideal, ideas they let you know about it look at Disco for thatI have imagined stories and events for the Universe and the characters and to be honest nothing in this shows comes close but they try and to frank about half of the ideas work but the bring things together the story arks for the season its not their we don't see a beginning a middle and an end joined together with stories character development its a sort of jumble of people places and events that are some how related if it was a book you'd bee flicking back pages to try and figure out who are what that was and why it was importantThe writer (writers) want the sort of Sherlock idea were we see paths from all sorts of significant and insignificant things on screen became mixed to reveal before separating again to tell all sorts of parallel tales like the Netflix Marvel TV shows were a character has a story that comes to collide and be significant with the main plot but the other parts don't well not until latter on in not always as significant but still enjoyable for the viewer this is disjointed it lacks the flowThe New characters are very good we get some interesting back stories but the out comes are very poor to be honest they are so I don't know bland and to be frank agitating we have the unlikely hero couple the (now new) gay couple the peter pan and to top it all off no one dies (ok its trek I get it) they tie them self in such a horrendous plot at the end of season one to pull that off, the season two ending by comparison is interesting and has possibilities until that is season 3The worst thing I can say about season one and two is they try some new things some work some don't but that's S-Fi some time the mad ideas work some times they don'tBUT and I have to say this season three is shocking it is a good example of the situation regarding past knowledge and new ideas it spins time back to the final episodes of TNG and the last scenes of Nemesis it ignores every other thing that has happened in the universe including Spokes failure but and this is the problem only because the writers did not like the events elsewhere in the universe not like star wars were they didn't like the events in The Last Jedi and had to wiggle about a lot to try and fix it season three just ignores the previous two with two exceptions Robo Picard and sevens (now definitely) gay partnerWith the same problems of length disjointed plot and the added entertainment of two reveals that weren't and an ending so outrages I actually thought season one was good the only thing missing form season three is the Cook moment (Hunt for Red October) It is really bad so bad they get the fat enterprise back its shocking how poor it is it actually is on a par with The Last Jedi and to top it all off the suspected spin off possibility is yet another (Constitution) NCC-1701 they couldn't come up with a new name or even a new ship its the one they have been fling around in the hole season.There is one thing I have to say about this there is one recall from TNG (DS9) and two new babies that work Worf is fantastic in particular when on screen with Raffi and the La Forge sisters are good dialogue was a wee bit flat at times and the daddy trying to save them was stupid but the actress were well cast and put some effort inSo Stop at 2 funny that was the Si-Fi jock for a long time.","rating":"7\/10","date":"4 May 2023"}

{"title":"Writing... Terrible! Nostalgia in Season 3... Good.","review":"I don't see how the writers have jobs. Season 1 was about a 3 hour movie split into 10 parts or whatever. Season 2 was worse. A 1.5 hour move split into 10. Season 3 seems good but the nostalgia helps it to be interesting and they actually had a bit more story but.... BUT....A mystery isn't a mystery just because you say it is. All they have done every season is say a sentence about something, then not ask or show anything.In season 3, a character has a power but never asks about it from someone who obviously knows.There's no main known protagonist until the penultimate episode because they don't say anything at all or give hints. So after 9 episodes, just like the other 2 seasons, they have to tie EVERYTHING up in one episode.It would've been better in all, to start with why the protagonist is doing what he or she is doing then have the story of why plus what Picard is doing about it.Season 2 didn't even make sense. Watch the protagonist talk at I've point like he's angry at Picard and needs to stop this but in the end he isn't. WTF.The episodes have no stories of their own. They don't further the plot really and if they do it's only a few minutes of the episode.Season 1 is Battlestar Galactica but poorly written.I can't believe these people have jobs.The ideas were good but they could fit every season into a 2 hour movie.Season 3 though.... I like all the fan service even if it's silly. That at least makes it fun but wow. Are people that watch really that dumbed down that they're okay with this. Discovery is almost as bad but they almost corrected it in their 3rd season.There's a reason serialized didn't work years ago and most everything went episodic. But in the internet era, it's better to be episodic because people will rewatch an episode that tells it's own story. They won't watch an episode of a serial that doesn't and most certainly won't watch a whole season for one story.Strange New Worlds figured it out. Have single stories each time but also occasionally have them interconnected. You get a serial but you can also watch individual showsI'm glad this is the last season. I only watch because I'm a Trek fan and want to see what happens but I'll never watch this or discovery a second time. Strange New Worlds, I will.","rating":"1\/10","date":"17 April 2023"}
{"title":"TNG continued!","review":"This show proves that a new series based on an old series can be really good! And believe me, this is not just good, it's truly excellent!Star Trek: Picard sort of continues the storyline of the movie Nemesis, but it also introduces a band of interesting new characters. It shows the after-effects of what happened in Nemesis, and the enormous influence this has had on the Federation. It also adds a mystery that fits Picard and TNG perfectly, and it all comes together in a way that is pleasing to both older TNG fans and new audiences.The SFX look stunning and the production has a genuine Star Trek feel to it. To me as a fan of all Star Trek series (but especially TNG) every episode is a thrill, and I am always sad when the episode ends. I hope this show will last for many years to come!","rating":"10\/10","date":"3 February 2020"}

Seven is no longer Seven, Soong is no longer Soong, Guinan is no longer Guinan, The Borg Queen is no longer the Borg Queen.The writing for season two is so bad, that if the show is reliant on the characters to explain whats going on in every shot, there is something wrong with the shots, the telling could just have someone sit and tell it all, except that wouldn't be possible either as the writing is so bad.Season 1 was epic and interesting, reliant on nostalgic well defined characters, and actors loyal with honest depictions, being very enjoyable to observe.The final episode is it's saving grace.","rating":"7\/10","date":"12 October 2022"}

{"title":"Haters gonna hate","review":"I think this site needs a different kind of user review. This show is good. Really good. Not perfect, but as perfect as it can be. Let me explain.This is a show where an octagenarian plays a nonagenarian. It's certainly the first tale of its kind in Star Trek, and one of only a few in any genre. Picard is a man who once was a paragon of strength, intelligence, and bravery, all of which is much harder for him to continue to be in his age. But, Picard's capacity to trust and love that was hard-earned through seven seasons of TNG is still very much intact, and likely will be what brings him and the federation through this troubled time. If you want to see the true mastery of the show, just watch the heart to hearts between Picard and the other characters. Heck, any of the characters -- all the actors are more than pulling their weight.As for the plot, they literally couldn't have picked a better arc. The episode \"the measure of a man\" was an early classic in TNG, and to see the ramifications of that episode and how pivotal they have become is downright fascinating. And the writers rarely leave a stone unturned, forming a very deep, rich and intriguing plot that has me begging for longer episodes.To make a few other rebuttals:Currency: the lack of currency is purely a federation concept as a communist society. Every other domain has some kind of currency. The original series has plenty of episodes centered on trade, TNG introduced credits, DS9 had gold pressed latinum. Quit whining about currency please.Roddenberry's vision of Utopia: Rodenberry never, ever implied that things were a-ok in the federation and always would be. 75% of all the episodes ever showed that without constant vigilance and sacrifice by the captains and crews of the Enterprise etc., the Utopia would have collapsed hundreds of times over, either from outside forces or from within. When Picard and his crew resigned, and with no one of caliber to take the mantle, is it so surprising things have deteriorated?Rebuttals aside now: relax, watch the show, and enjoy it. Every new series of star trek has their haters, even TNG had them when it launched. If we had listened to them with TNG, where would star trek be now?","rating":"9\/10","date":"7 March 2020"}

{"title":"abandon all rationality!","review":"What a pity that the writers of this series forgot that star trek was based on a vision of the future where logic, reason and facts are the basis for science , technology and progress. This is how, in the star trek universe, humanity achieved everything in the stories up to discovery. From then on , including picard , there was only emotion and irrational behaviour in the stories (+ gross discontinuities). Don't get me wrong, i loved seeing the characters of STTNG and voyager again, but everything else was qutie irritating. Season one was watchable, season 2 is hopeless. Fire those writers and put a panel of people on the job that have watched, enjoyed and understood the highlights of what star trek was about (and why it was so inspiring and succesfull, past tense).","rating":"2\/10","date":"12 May 2022"}

If your head is stuck in the past and you want everything to live up to your expectations, just stop trying to enjoy new cinematography. If you like good acting, storytelling and a a new way of exploring that Star Trek you've known for so long, you're going to have a great time. And if you're in for a bit of nostalgia, that's there too. It's crazy to see there's so many toxic fans that will never ever be entertained anymore.

The series was always going to find it difficult to please Trekkers who wanted Star Trek Next Gen qualities as portrayed in the 80's and 90's and those who want to see growth in characters and relationships. In 2020 I don't want to over-analyse, just enjoy and appreciate. Like the original series, there are characters you immediately warm to and those you don't. Just having Sir Patrick Stewart back on the screen is reward enough so I will continue to savour this interpretation of a more mature Star Trek.","rating":"10\/10","date":"7 April 2020"}

{"title":"Boring series","review":"Star Trek: Picard Season 2 on Paramount+ evolves around Jean-Luc answering a distress call from the Borg. After almost a complete annihilation, Picard and his crew find themselves on a different timeline that finds General Picard as a conqueror and Seven of Nine as President of the Federation. The team ends up going back in time to 2024 Los Angeles to pinpoint when and where the time continuum changed. This season we learn more about Picard and his family legacy, amazingly all these years we never knew about his mom and her nightmares. This is yet another Trek series that deals with time travel, it's just crazy that the writers couldn't be creative enough to write a better story without having to effect the time line. This season is directed by Lea Thompson, Joe Melendez and of course Jonathan Frakes. The same cast returns but I fell out of love from subpar performances by Michele Hurd and Jeri Ryan, they didn't belong and hopefully are written off. Whoopi Goldberg also has an appearance and we get to learn more about her species and how long they have been on Earth even before the discovery of alien life. Overall it is a good series but I wouldn't watch it again.","rating":"7\/10","date":"8 August 2022"}

A young woman, Dahj (Isa Briones) is attacked in her home and her boyfriend is murdered. This awakens dormant but lethal training in her and after she kills her attackers, she inexplicably feels like the only place she'll be safe is with Jean-Luc, a man she's never met.In the beginning, \"Picard\" has felt like it was telling a defined story rather than an opened ended one, probably in no small part due to the advanced years of its star performer. Within that though, those first two seasons felt like they were lacking in a coherent vision. With their overall stories constantly being derailed and detoured by subplots that didn't go anywhere, this is particularly true of the second run.There were characters across the run that I liked, and characters that I didn't like. There were regular cameos from TNG actors, but its not really until the third season that the show feels like a real successor to that series, with most of the main cast returning. Several actors, Brent Spiner, Orla Brady and Santiago Cabrera play several iterations of the same characters across the run. But it's the plotting that ultimately undoes those first two runs.It does all come good in that third and final season though, with a much better story matched to the return of all of the cast, not just rambling fan service but a story which makes sense for them all to return for (even if perhaps it a little convenient in the jobs the various crew have taken).Just watch season three and ignore the rest.","rating":"6\/10","date":"9 July 2023"}
{"title":"still unworthy - but acceptable","review":"I won't write about season 1 or 2 as we can probably almost all agree what a blasphemy this was.My rating remains low because of those two seasons and half a good season 3 doesn't make it much better overall either. Anyone who speaks of a masterpiece or something similar just because of Season 3 has definitely inhaled some toxic gases for too long, or has already seen too much Kurtzman Trek, which is practically the same thing.Season 3 was acceptable in its last half.The first 4 episodes were unnecessary, boring and still New Trek to the core, it all felt like the script was meant for a 2 hour movie but it was stretched into a series. Then the bad writing and the terrible dialogues and generally how the people and crew speak or behave on duty doesn't work at all and isn't Star Trek.Then there's unfortunately still Raffi, who should have been sorted out in the very first episode. Because the only thing the character contributes is the constant reminder of the pathetic previous seasons, the character is unlikable anyway.....\nEspecially since her contribution to the story was insignificant, it could have worked without her involvement, and every interaction between her and Worf was just cringe, which significantly harms every scene she appears in.... Worf is generally too silly, half as much would have been enough!But the last half wasn't really good either, most of all the inappropriate humor annoyed me in really serious and dramatic moments. For example, Geordi loses his two daughters to the Borg (at least temporarily, but he has no way of knowing that) and his wife is at least in danger and in the next scene he jokes with the old crew.Then odd presentation of Captain Shaw, who is portrayed as a total joke, even lying on the ground crying in one scene, which just doesn't fit. Ditto when the entire bridge crew suddenly starts crying when threatened by Vadic, just embarrassing. The crew generally behaves like toddlers, e.g. When everyone comes onto Picard's holodeck session, like crawling into their parents' bed -.-Some extremely weird behavior of the leaders, more often than not crew members are just left to die for no reason for example as Picard and Co, fleeing from the Titan over several decks. In general, it wouldn't be so bad if there were such inconsistencies from time to time, but unfortunately it's constant.Still, the last few episodes have had an impact on me that I definitely wasn't expecting beforehand.From complete unwatchable crap to guilty pleasure material, it's still an achievement that I don't want to deny ;)Even if I don't want to be a doomsayer, the next \"series\" will probably be the same as before. Since the people responsible won't learn anything from this small success, Picard season 3 is probably just an anomaly.","rating":"3\/10","date":"21 April 2023"}
{"title":"Bad Reviews Are Silly","review":"I am really dumbfounded by all of the negative reviews of Picard. I want to say upfront that I am a massive fan of TNG. Picard is not TNG. I am not sure if people were expecting a new season of TNG in 2020? If so, you should consider yourself very silly. Picard is absolutely masterful. It is engaging, interesting, thought-provoking and, most importantly, relevant. What made TNG so wonderful was the exploration of philosophy and ethics through reflection of modern events and issues in the 1990s within the context of a better, more just future. That was 30 years ago!!!! Picard manages that same philosophical self-reflection but of our modern western world in 2020. Some things are better, many things are worse. That is simply our reality and if holding a mirror to ourselves makes fans upset, then you have been incredibly self-deluded. What is so absolutely fantastic about Picard is how the creators and Patrick Stewart have been able to integrate elements of TNG into a novel and updated world of Star Trek and the character of Picard himself, who is not the same Captain we watched and grew to love, but an Admiral 30-years his senior at the twilight of his life and career. We should all be so lucky. Please do not listen or allow any of the silly reviews on this website to bias you. Give Picard a chance. Do not go in expecting TNG. Expect something new, something older, something different, something engaging, a show that not only holds a mirror to modern times through a TNG-colored lens, but to you yourself; an older, more experienced you, one that grew up watching and loving TNG.","rating":"10\/10","date":"26 March 2020"}
{"title":"Better the first season","review":"I thought the 1st season was very good and compelling. The 2nd season, bringing back Q was clever, but after the first few episodes I found the story a bit dragging. Although I think the season 2 finale was ultimately satisfying, the season was a few episodes too long for the story. I think all of the actors did a really great job, and I would love to give it higher stars but I am balancing the 2 seasons. Overall I felt it was a good show, but season two could have been done in fewer episodes IMHO. I am hoping that season 3 will echo some of the great parts of the 1st season. Although if there is not a season 3, I do feel this is a good conclusion for the character of Jean-Luc Picard.","rating":"7\/10","date":"28 September 2022"}
{"title":"Shockingly Bad","review":"The showrunner and writers couldn't have made Picard (especially Season 2) worse if they tried. The dialog is juvenile, much of the supporting cast is amateurish, and they have taken everything that makes the Trek universe great and thrown it out the window. Plots don't make sense, we spend most of the time inside people's minds, and the string of disconnected events that are supposed to create \"drama\" are laughable. To top it off, they took a show about space and the elevation of the human condition and twisted it into a show set in the present, with no space ships, no worlds to explore, and a dismal and dreary view of humanity. We don't want a Star Trek series to tell us how horrible the present is! We already know! We want Trek to show us a more optimistic future and do it with style, intelligence and excitement. This show couldn't be further from that goal. Don't desecrate your memories of TNG by watching this.","rating":"1\/10","date":"6 May 2022"}
{"title":"Sooooo goooood","review":"I've loved every season. Honestly it started a little slow to grab my attention when the 1st season came out that it took me a few months to try again to get into it. But quickly realized that they were just building up and introducing the story and let me tell ya.. it was worth it. Each season was great but this 3rd season was my favorite!!!! Oh my God i could rewatch it again easily. Thanks for making this paramount. If you want to make another season id be grateful. They dont make good scifo tv anymore. If you're having a tough time starting it trust me.. it's worth it. Keep going. Piccard is amazing.","rating":"10\/10","date":"22 April 2023"}
{"title":"Far the best series Sci-Fi series out there","review":"Well, to be honest, I was stunned! Level of emotions I felt, while watching was even stronger from the one when I saw Arya Stark struck that dagger into Night King! They way this \"oldies\" are carrying the energy through the show is amazing. Somehow they inprinted in my generation minds, toghether with captain Kirk, that they are Star Trek. Unlike the Discovery, this is simply it. We are looking at \"old\" crew gathered for the one last adventure, yet they are full of energy, and coverting that into a first class series on the screen. I specially like the moment where you can clearly see that there is more to come with combination of old and new crew, with captain Seven of Nine, and young Picard, but I am sure that in the seasons to come, we will see all of the oldies when needed just to make story so powerful like in season 3. Q will obviously play significant part in it. At last for the end I am sure that there are many of you out there who can't wait to hear which line Seven of Nine uses to order Enterprise to jump to warp. Bye everyone until season 4.","rating":"10\/10","date":"22 April 2023"}
{"title":"Star Trek is back!!","review":"Season 3 of Star Trek Picard has been the best Trek to grace our screens in over 20 years. It has finally took us back to what Star Trek is and should be. I have cried, laughed and been astonished at the level of detail from sets, effects to music. I really hope Star Trek can move away from the Disco alternate reality that has ruined Trek and back to the prime universe with a new Star Trek - Legacy series, as this will lead Star Trek back on the right path. It has been wonderful seeing the old crew back together for another adventure and I hope to see them again in a new series in the 25th century. Thank you for making my dreams come true with season 3 of Picard! Live long and prosper!","rating":"10\/10","date":"21 April 2023"}
{"title":"Dont trust the negative reviews.","review":"Oh boy. Just finished Season 1, im pretty disappointed that I delayed watching the show due to the negative reviews it had.Is this Star Trek? No, yes, but not really. At least not S1.Is it bad? Not at all.You only have some bare bones of the show, and some members of the cast, thats how we can tell it is Star Trek and not other thing, which may make people think the show its bad.But the central piece of the show was Data. All the cast and characters were great, but Data was the best written character of the show and probably the most loved one too, and the first season is all about him, despite Data just being in a couple of scenes in the entire season.Of course i would have liked an entire new season of TNG over Picard 100%. But this one is a different approach. Season 1 doesnt come near to TNG, but again, nothing does, that show was a masterpiece almost impossible to emulate. What I can say is that is a good show. Not TNG good, but still good enough to enjoy.","rating":"7\/10","date":"30 April 2023"}

I see a lot of reviews judging the series on the first season. Well I am telling you be like judging the entire Star Trek \"enterprise\" on The Cage or the first 10 minutes of Wizard of Oz and saying that movie sucked without watching all. I get it, my friend could not get through first season but I made him plow on. Your life will not be complete unless you watch the whole 3 years series and then dare you to say anything but WOW - Yes slow season 1 and pace setter season 2 culminated to be the MOST moving and riveting and emotional season 3\/finale ever watched.

{"title":"passing of the torch and legacy preservation","review":"Season 1 of Picard was impressive, a beloved return to what made TNG special. Season 2 was a meandering mess, focusing too much on the childhood traumas of our protagonist. But season 3 ignited a spark of fandom that always smouldered inside every TNG fan. Now that the finale is over I am choked up with emotion and fulfillment.The writers have expertly woven in the threads of previous seasons, focusing on the meaning of a well-lived life - dedicated to duty and loyalty. If anything the interaction of old crew members shows that bonds forged last forever.A recurring theme is the eternal question of legacy, which certainly plagues any person blessed or cursed enough to reach old age. The struggles of parents and children span the ages, regardless of which galaxy you live in.This season is the most meaningful stellar conjugation and alignment of all the old shows, revisiting relics of the past while paying respectful tribute. The writers did a fantastic job, with quotes such as \"Stars in the same galaxy, light years between us\" and \"We are not in control of what we pass on\". The power of memories demonstrated was very moving - we exist because of the memories that define us.It is fitting that Picard and his faithful crew would face up against his most iconic and lethal intergalactic foe, in yet another monumental showdown across time and space. Sci-Fi offers no greater villains.If there is a recurring lesson here, sophisticated organizations like Starfleet are incredibly vulnerable to the slow, insidious, internal threat. The sins of past deeds do return on a titanic scale, and the arrogance of those in power hastens the demise.Seeing all the TNG crew together around the same table, older and way cooler, was a truly unforgettable moment in TV history. Other franchises that missed such opportunities will be held accountable for ages to come. It was particularly satisfying to see each of our beloved characters achieving their fullest potential and meaning in a life well-lived.I am so glad there was no empty fan service. This is truly a passing of the torch and legacy preservation. It was so fulfilling to see one last poker game before any of these beloved crew members trekked into the great beyond the afterlife. The after-credits scene aptly lays the ground for much anticipated and appreciated adventures to come.","rating":"10\/10","date":"23 April 2023"}
{"title":"A spoiler free review.","review":"It is very difficult to rate this series since never before have I witnessed a series where there is such a monumental difference in the quality of each season.Season 1 is ok, just ok, it has some nice moments, but it lacks the feel of Star Trek, has one or two annoying characters, some boring periods but it isn't too awful.Season 2 starts off ok but quickly plummets in to something that is just plain insulting to every TNG fan and is clearly written by people who have never even watched TNG. The stupidity of the characters and the storyline will surely make you cringe the further you get in to it. It simply isn't Star Trek, just an awful drama played out by bumbling idiots.And then comes Season 3...... Wow. They must have fired the previous writers and got people in who actually understand their target audience. It is for most TNG fans everything you could have wished for. A decent plot, space adventure, and many of the original TNG cast are back. The chemistry between them and the nostalgia you will feel to see them back together again will surely put a smile on your face.My advice would be to give S1 a go, but then skip S2 entirely as it will simply leave a bad taste in your mouth. You can go straight to S3 without knowing or caring about anything that happened in S2.It is a shame that they didn't get it right the first time. For me:Season 1 = 6\/10\nSeason 2 = 2\/10\nSeason 3 = 9\/10.","rating":"6\/10","date":"2 June 2023"}

{"title":"Set expectations for fun and you won't be disappointed. Hard Core Trekkies may want to give it a miss.","review":"To say I was taken by surprise when Star Trek: Picard was announced would be quite the understatement. My first thought was that it would be set in a 24th Century equivalent of a '70s hippy commune, where there was plenty of sex, drugs, and scenes where all the girls' \"clothes fall off\" but he \"sees it all\".My apologies, I just.I really didn't know what to expect, but I certainly didn't expect very much. My bar was set low, and I was very happy to say right-hand say that, upon watching the first few episodes of series one, I was pleasantly surprised. The story had a fair amount of intrigue, a lot of the dear old actors from the ST franchise, and NG in particular, and I found it quite engaging and thoroughly enjoyable to watch.I was very pleased that they continued into series two. This time, however, it seemed to start quite slow for me. Perhaps I should have watch series one again before beginning series two. That may have helped to get me back into the mindset and environment.As series two progressed I found the storyline a little too fantastic, but, at the same time, it was still entertaining, and allowed me to gain my ST fix.Each series gives me the impression and comes across like a mega-length episode of ST:NG. Sometimes it can feel a little slow, however they pace also takes TV r opportunity to delve deeper into some of the pasts of the main characters, and that is interestIng in itself.Overall I am really enjoying watching this ST Picard. It's totally worth a binge watch on a rainy day, or, in my case, where I have been forced to lay up for a few days after suffering a bad fall.I do hope others feel the same and enjoy it as much as I have. It's been fun and a good story.At the end of the day people need to remember that this is totally fictional, and, if taken too seriously, it will only lead to disappointment.","rating":"8\/10","date":"10 May 2022"}
{"title":"Started bad, ended amazing","review":"Ok, it didn't start BAD, the first season was entertaining but far from memorable. The second season was a mess. But the third season...The third season of Picard is Star Trek at it's very best. It isn't fan service at a single turn, it is an absolute love letter to TNG from start to finish. Less Star Wars and more Top Gun: Maverick. It's not about seeing an iconic character (or 7) back on an iconic starship. It's about real closure. It's about seeing the family we grew up with get back together one last time for something that TRULY matters. It's about revisiting a franchise with a REAL story to tell, not just something some suit-and-tie thinks the fans want to see. Everything that happens in the storyline is organic, it makes sense to the plot, and is well within the expected behavior of the characters as they have been so lovingly and painstakingly portrayed over the last three-odd decades.Don't even watch the first two seasons, you can get enough details about Raffi and Seven from a wiki to get you caught up enough to know what's up in Season 3. Season 3 of Picard is all you need to put the tear in your eye to remind you how much you loved TNG, and it is the perfect goodbye to the command crew of the Enterprise D. It is, inarguably, a much better sendoff than Kirk received.","rating":"9\/10","date":"11 June 2023"}

It was all about different worlds and dilemmas with different beings from those worlds. It was strange and awesome! Always looked forward to new episodes. I was really looking forward to this series as well.This show is good but really different from what I was used to. Of course we have had technical advancements with picture quality and set designs, and costumes, but this show feels sluggish while at the same time, not taking the time to explain things. There wasn't a lot of character building but this is season 1, so I figure that will take its time. Soji is an interesting character and so is Rios and Rafi. I enjoyed watching them. So while sluggish at times, there are scenes that are very entertaining. Rafi is always onto something. Rios' other parts are so funny and really fun to watch. A great show, but with a few drawbacks.

{"title":"Pleased with the ending","review":"Over all the three seasons the average score that I give is seven. 7 stars for season 1, 5 stars for season 2, and 9 stars for season 3.I thought the first season was fairly solid and interesting but much different than any of the other Star Treks before it. I thought the stories about the Androids, Romulans, and the Borg were captivating. The reintroduction of Admiral Picard at a later age and Seven of Nine semi-reincorporated into society were well done. However, I was not a huge fan of any of the new characters.Season 2 was a huge disappointment and completely forgettable. It really lead nowhere and the whole time travel and new type of Borg were quite unnecessary to the story. Luckily all of these new characters were not included in season 3 except for Rafi.Season 3 was a blast with the reintroduction of the original cast of The Next Generation and had some very good aspects of original storytelling of Star Trek and the whole philosophy of it. The season developed very well with a good story arc and climax as well as a good coda to send the old characters off, although they could still make some appearances, and introduce a whole new set of characters on the Enterprise G, captained by Captain Seven.I'm definitely not saying that season 3 was the perfect season of Star Trek, but I am saying that the writers, directors, and actors made up for the lackluster season 1 and 2.","rating":"7\/10","date":"28 April 2023"}

Playing a retired Picard who is a bit too full of himself and yet still yearning for one more mission to do some good in the galaxy, he plays it all perfectly.This series so far is light years beyond Discovery which is good at times but a slog at others.

I am so intensely curious at how that came to be.Everything was beautiful and I envy the fans who have already seen the next two episodes.","rating":"10\/10","date":"24 January 2020"}
{"title":"I'm out. Star Trek is finished to me.","review":"I tried to like it. I wanted to like it. After 3 and 3\/4 episodes, I've given up. The writing is atrocious. It's someone who tried to write an essay the night before they had to hand it in to the professor. The storyline is desperately trying to be clever but is muddled and all over the place.Jean-Luc Picard is not in this show. Patrick Stewart is. The acting is terrible. Local town charity production terrible. The settings and tech used is worse than it was nearly thirty years ago. How is that possible. Think Cats special effects. LCARS would have been better. The camera work and lighting are dire. Are they trying to be artistic in being this bad with the production values?There is the other elephant in the room. One of the great things about the first two series was their effortless depiction of liberal values. I became an engineer because I wanted to be Georgi La Forge so bad. The fact that he was African-American did not even enter that ten-year old's mind. Tasha Yar was security chief. Of course she was. She's a tactical and close combat expert. I nearly because a medical doctor because Beverly Crusher was awesome. Dr. Crusher was an awesome doctor. She was not an awesome woman doctor. Her gender and race were irrelevant. The TV series is so blatantly virtue-signalling, cry bullying, and obeying the rules of woke, that my wife got up and walked out with a \"Oh beep off\" at one pathetically contrived political statement. The only thing that might get me to watch the remainder(I won't) is to see how they will work in an anti-Trump statement(I'm not American, and I couldn't give a hoot one way or another about Trump).I've officially given up on this franchise. Roddenberry would be turning in his grave.","rating":"1\/10","date":"15 February 2020"}
{"title":"Utterly fantastic!","review":"I think we spend too much time criticising and picking things apart; in this case, a TV show. I didn't sit here getting upset over plot holes, or cannon-related issues. I watched the series and took in everything that it was. Picard had a wonderful story and characters you could really engage with emotionally. I felt happiness, anger, sadness and excitement throughout the series. I found myself involved in and unwinding the messages it presented, which gave real immersion to my experience. I would highly recommend to anyone, be they a fan or Star Trek or not. But please, I ask you, to just sit back and enjoy it for what it is.","rating":"8\/10","date":"27 March 2020"}

It's just a moronic old man.Don't forget the uninteresting characters. Seven of Nine clearly spent too much time in the Terran system because she now a man hating angry lesbian and like Stewart, I can't see Seven of Nine whatsoever, I just see the actress.Picard constantly being chastised by angry women of authority, it's all nonsense.This is what happens when you try to fit an agenda into a series.There is nothing of Star Trek in this other than some character names.","rating":"1\/10","date":"24 September 2022"}

It seems people trashing Discovery and Picard would like to get hundreds more episodes of the same thing.Here, the producers give us something totally new, using the Star Trek universe as means to tell a new kind of story. A serialized mystery diving deep in Picard's past to shape his future.Most of those who enjoyed having their thoughts provoked by Star Trek (which is, in spite of some what people think, what Star Trek has been doing since TOS) will enjoy this show.","rating":"10\/10","date":"11 February 2020"}

I felt Enterprise was good if not up to the other 3.\nPersonally I don't think Star Trek was meant to be movies but hey some good some bad.\nDiscovery I looked forward to but I gave up after first series.

{"title":"One of the best come-backs in TV history","review":"As a massive TNG fan, I couldn't be happier. Yes, it's not TNG. Yes, it deserves a nine. And, unlike The Mandalorian, it didn't have a single Stargate-like episode.Season 1 offers a fresh approach and the nostalgia inducing moments are carefully divided between humorous and dead serious. It has a great pacing - never too slow, never too rushed over - it's just right. The overall idea is fair to middling, but the storytelling never fails. Do you prefer your scientifiction shows campy and yet riveting? Look again - they've got a Jedi Elf in the crew. Are you a person with strong taste for good acting and special effects verging on perfect? I'll let you have your moment alone.I seriously doubt it that the second season could possibly get worse. It's a Sir Patrick Stewart thing, after all. And I definitely think there's a lesson learned with this show, for both Star Trek creators and Star Trek fans.","rating":"9\/10","date":"26 March 2020"}

Not everything needs to be drowned in alphabet soup or steeped in racism. It's boring!! And if you have not figured it out yet, people have had enough. Anyone that continues supporting this horse hockey, is so clearly beyond help and drunk on their own self righteous flavoured koolaid.Disney has triple downed on their grooming, and they have suffered incredible losses this year.

{"title":"I loved it & really can't understand the reactions here","review":"I've been a Trek fan all my life, across five decades & have watched every episode at least twice. For me, this was wonderful. Yes, I'm saddened by the occasional profanity; also, the death of one of the supporting characters was a misstep; and there was some misjudged comedy involving a beret. These are my only criticisms. By & large, this was a joy. I felt it served the TNG legacy characters it featured very well - & the Data scenes were beautiful.I see a lot of venom aimed at this show in the reviews here & really don't get it. There seems to be a lot of angry people these days. The show does hold up a mirror, as great Star Trek always has - & maybe they can't handle that.","rating":"10\/10","date":"15 August 2020"}
{"title":"Stewart is brilliant, but the rest.....who wrote this drivel?","review":"I came for Picard....and he doesn't disappoint. The rest of it however, is very disappointing indeed. Whoever is writing this crap has clearly never watched Star Trek. Half the cast is good at what they do, the other half is horrible. The soap opera overacting is almost unbearable, the side drama is nothing but filler, and I don't know how much more more bad facial expressions I can take. Agnes and the person who plays her....well, they both suck. The director is killing me almost as much as he\/she is killing this show. I certainly hope the bad actors get killed off soon, or this show is doomed.

{"title":"Stuck in the past","review":"I've been reading and watching Science fiction since I was a young lad in the early sixties. I loved Dr. Who and when Star Trek started I was an immediate fan and have remained so for all the various offshoots since. Yes, some series have been better than others but (in my opinion) all have been eminently watchable. I cannot understand the negativity expressed by so many of the reviewers on her regarding Picard. What do you want people? Some are complaining because instead of stand alone episodes we have a serialised story. Some seem to want everything exactly as it was in the original Star Trek or TNG. Everything changes. Do you really need instant gratification with short stories and no development. For me, this new series has left me frustrated only because I want know what happens next. It is set in a time where the Federation is cracking and seems to be withdrawing from it's ideals and only Picard and his former friends\/colleagues\/shipmates are aware of it. I think I know who the baddies are but do I. I am loving every episode and can't wait for the next one.","rating":"10\/10","date":"6 March 2020"}

It is simply good story telling with characters that have realistic reactions to events in this future world. Picard, as a character in STTNG was rather one dimensional.

{"title":"A decent series unlike the bad reviews.","review":"I started watching this series with an open mind as the title said Picard and unlike the earlier StarTrek titles.Former Captain JL Picard no more serving in the force and confined to his country side home.\nSome new unexpected events force him or his conscience to get back in the game.\nNow, this is where things are different from the other series.\nHe has no power\/authority unlike before. To even form a team, he has to pay from his pocket.\nIn such a world, how he gets help from very few resources\/contacts and build a team to go on the quest is the basis of Picard. This they have shown very well. Is put in a quite realistic manner.\nSo don't expect any heavy fire Power or to many crew in the space uniforms. But it has enough content to keep us gripped till the end.I admit to binge watching in between to know what happens as the events unravel and plot thickens...It's great to see a few of the previous Star Trek characters appearing and making it even more enjoyable.Sir Patrick Stewart , as good as always. Graceful with age, but still kicking for more...\nOverall the casting was good and realistic.","rating":"8\/10","date":"17 September 2020"}
{"title":"Dont listen to the hate","review":"I felt compelled to write a review after reading from so many other reviewers that \"real\" fans of star trek should not watch this.Toxic fanboys do not speak for all fans of star trek.Yes the series has changed to a more modern format of one over arcing story and yes Picard has grown old. He is not a captain anymore and he is more subdued, but he is still Picard. Do those complaining about his changed demeanour expect him to be the same after so many years have passed since his retirement from starfleet? It is actually a plot point they address in the show. \"I've not been living, I've been waiting to die\" he says.The series explores ideas and themes from TNG, such as Picards PTSD from being assimilated by the Borg and his relationship with Data, along with many other callbacks and easter eggs that fans of TNG will recognise. It does this while still feeling fresh and like its own seperate thing. It is not trying to be a TNG remake and thats a good thing.Old school 90's mystery of the week TNG is great.So is this.","rating":"8\/10","date":"24 June 2020"}

{"title":"The continuing decline of what we used to know as Star Trek","review":"I'm not an obsessive Trek fan, but I'm old enough to have seen and enjoyed TNG when it first aired in the UK in the late '80s, so I will always have a soft spot for that incarnation of Picard, played so well by Patrick Stewart.So on to STAR TREK PICARD.........what a mess. In the full ten hours of series 1, approximately 30 minutes of it were watchable, and most of that was in the first episode alone. By this measure, i'd give it less than 1\/10 if I could.To get this out of the way first, episode 1 is the only one that remotely deserves to be titled 'Picard'. It does a serviceable job of re-introducing us to him, now at 90+ years of age. Then the generic plot about the mysterious girl who's the key to everything (yawn) seeps in. From that point onward, Picard (literally) takes a back row seat, shared with a plethora of other characters in his Serenity-like outcast space gang.From there we are subjected to a series of underdeveloped, dead-end ideas, pointless characters, terrible editing, lazy, idiotic writing, and embarrassingly shoe-horned in preachy political agenda. Yes Star Trek has always had political analogies to contemporary culture and our every days lives, but it used to do it in a subtle fashion and show things from all sides to let the viewer come to their own decisions. Now it seems to be bluntly telling us what we should think in convenient soundbites between the mindless action. The only parts I found entertaining were for all the wrong reasons, hilarious stupidity.Who sanctioned these useless producers with the responsibility for new Star Trek? The mind boggles. There are so many on-the-nose-stupid things littered throughout the entire series, that you really have to wonder if the writers put them in there to annoy people on purpose.The one thing that finally made me feel this might be the case, was the ridiculous imagination-powered device that enables its operator to do literally anything they want in the final episode. This helps a couple of characters get out of tight spots without having to use any effort or ingenuity of their own. I can only assume this was done because the writers couldn't be bothered to (or just weren't capable of) coming up with anything better. Yes, it really does get that stupid.Everything that actually happens throughout the season could easily have been done in a single or double episode of a previously good Trek series like TNG. The whole thing is padded out with false drama around too many shallow, poorly realised characters, feeling and looking like a mish mash of generic fantasy sci-fi that has nothing to do with Star Trek.Everything is dark grey and half the sets look like an empty black sound stage with a couple of 1980s lazers pointing around and dry ice machines (Oooh it looks edgy and Dystopian like Blade Runner).The show uses the tactic of positing vague irrational mysteries left-right and centre like Lost did (something that was also exec-produced by JJ Abrams), with few sensible resolutions or satisfying pay-offs, this comes across as the only tactic the writers know to attempt to keep people watching, but shows itself up as a substitute for good writing, good characters, good dialogue....which are the other (now considered 'old fashioned' I guess?) methods of keeping people watching.The final 'climax' (not that it deserves that description) in episode 10 was so unbelievably cliched - Howard The Duck did it better in 1986 (young'ens who think Picard is 'legit good', go watch that) and that was a comedy, unfortunately Picard is not, not intentionally any way. Looking at it this way, Star Trek has finally been reduced to nothing more than a bunch of generic tropes used by countless shows and movies before, many of which were far superior.I could write a dissertation on how bad this series was. It's one of those times when the list of stupid things to mention gets so long, you just give up in a combination of disorientated bemusement & despair. Watch it for a good laugh at the stupidity. Or a good cry about the continued, depressing death of quality Trek.","rating":"1\/10","date":"28 March 2020"}

{"title":"Three Michael Chabons!","review":"I would just like to make a few observations here rather than giving an overall review. I really wanted to like Star Trek Discovery, but it quickly became too manic, action packed. It felt too much like the new movies and not at all like the television shows, especially Next Generation.Picard is starting out at a much more even keel, with more character development and a slower pace with a plot I can wrap my mind around. It is really good to see Picard again trying to solve a mystery fraught with moral delima. However, it is not at all (at least yet) about space exploration-- and so it is missing some of the heart that made the original series so great.However, Michael Chabon is doing a great job here. But is it just me, or is he such an egomaniac that he put himself in the show not once but twice. I mean the pilot and hologram characters, who to me are dead ringers for Chabon. I think this goes to the artist, like Chabon, putting himself into his work allowing himself to work out a relationship with the world he is trying to create. I don't know if this is a strength or a weakness, but I am sure that is what is going on here.I hope in future episodes that Picard keeps its even pacing and it would be nice to see some of the old cast and crew, though I understand why they chose to introduce new characters.","rating":"8\/10","date":"7 February 2020"}

{"title":"Mediocre Nostalgia","review":"Illusions...shattered. So disappointed. An unfortunate stain on Patrick Stewart's legacy, and Picard's. The very premise is an insult to this brilliant character: Picard, the greatest captain & admiral in history, has surrendered himself to a quiet, solitary, quaint, and purposeless life on a vineyard after resigning from Star Fleet 14 years ago in protest over a cancelled Romulan rescue mission. What?! That's their backstory?! Picard doesn't get his way, so he takes his ball and goes home?! JEAN LUC PICARD just gives up and has essentially does nothing for 14 years??!!! WTF??? What lazy writing! That is NOT the Picard I know! Star Trek: TNG's Picard would have kept fighting! He would have stolen a ship and found a way to rescue as many Romulans as he could anyways! He would have called on his friends and allies! Picard is NOT a quitter! He never would have just given up and retired to the countryside to live out the rest of his days and die of old age! Can't believe Stewart allowed them to disrespect his character like that!\nThe plot, writing, and dialogue all feel forced and contrived. Even the nostalgia feels forced. Episode 1 managed to stuff \"Earl Gray Tea\" into the dialogue no less than 3 times in the most awkward ways possible, ugh...\nThe characters feel like cardboard cut-outs; contrived stereotypes making inconsistent decisions based on unclear motives. There are more holes than actual plot in the predictable storyline that lacks any real substance. Kept hoping it would get better, but couldn't even bare to watch past episode 3. Stewart is one of the greatest actors of all time, but even at his greatest, he could not have salvaged this. So disappointed.","rating":"2\/10","date":"31 March 2020"}

In the end it was a story of how the federation lost its way because of fear yet they still came through in the end, doing what was fundamentally morraly right.The basis of startrek has always been about being better than we are, striving to be morally better, picard lived up to this and showed that people can still be redeemed.I think the low reviewers have not even given this a chance, they have just jumped on the \"this is not startrek\" bandwagon.At least they have left politics out of it, and there is no cringy pc stereotypes like Discovery either.","rating":"8\/10","date":"30 September 2021"}
{"title":"Picard Season 3","review":"I have watched the first two seasons of Picard and I think as a true fan of the TNG crew I was disappointed in season 1, mostly because the universe it takes place is was far to dark for Star Trek, in my opinion. Season 2 improved and had some wonderful scenes, but still had its issues. I'm on episode 2 of season 3 and it's riveting!Season 3, thus far, has done a wonderful job weaving in suspense and mystery. It many ways it reminds me how TNG wasn't good in season 1 or 2 of TNG, but by season 3 they seemed to have figured out their path. Picard Season 3, appears to be in the same category!Jack Crusher (Edward Speleers) has been a wonderful addition, tying together TNG central characters and giving a great motive for Picard and Riker to head out on one last adventure.The most important thing is the show is keeping me \"engage(d)\" to want to watch more!I suspect at the end of season 3, we will say good bye to the Enterprise D crew, and we may just be left with a new crew for a new reboot?

{"title":"CBS, please instead hire writers who don't hate Star Trek","review":"Slow. Too pessimistic and dark in tone. Too many f-bombs. Other Star Treks and Orville are episodic, with each episode being its own story. Picard Season 1 is one very, very, very long story, and it's just not a good one. So many other scifi films and TV shows have done the same story, but far better. People treat Picard like garbage and he just takes it, often showing no self-respect. The ninja-type character seemed promising, but is insultingly underused. The show was clearly written by people who don't know the old Star Trek shows and have disdain for those of us who did, e.g., ignores the wealth of old shows that portrayed a very gradual improvement and evolution of Human-Romulan relations. The brass who make this show should do what the makers of the Mandalorian did: put fans in charge. Dave Filoni and Jon Favreau adore Star Wars, and it shows in how they lovingly crafted the Mandalorian. The people who wrote and directed Picard have gone on record insulting Star Trek fans, and it shows.","rating":"1\/10","date":"4 April 2020"}
{"title":"Should be galled Gerri-at-Trek","review":"I don't remember Season 1 at all, so this review is based entirely off season 2.The cast is old... like both feet in the grave, old. Piccard's voice is shaky, and he frequently stands their slack-jawed, mouth breathing with a vacant stare, like he has no idea where he is or what's going on.For starters: I love TNG and Voyager as well as the newer movies.I liked the 2nd season, but I removed 1 star because of Woke-I-sode 3... with with woke pandering wokeness, and removed another star for turning a beloved character lesbian just to tick a box. This activism doesn't belong in Star Trek, and detracts from it's enjoyability. Though, it was done it much better ways than some of the other shows I've seen recently which utterly obliterate their shows with wokeness.Other than that, I enjoyed season 2.","rating":"8\/10","date":"2 June 2022"}

{"title":"Star Trek Picard is like Decard in Blade Runner. ( Awesome and cool )","review":"Just saw the first episode of this thankfully AWESOME looking series.First up, I am a Star Trek fan and NO, this is not a non-genuine review, I mean it from the bottom of my heart.This is looking amazing and is being done in the right way. Things change in the future but I'm ever confident that the purpose of Star Trek Picard will be, to bring back what Starfleet has forgotten and get it back on the track of the grand Rodenberry vision and if that takes a series or 2, so what and at the end of the day it will be honest. Seriously, do you really think that even if we achieved the grand vision of Gene Rodenberries Star Trek it would remain that way forever without any change. I don't think so and neither do a lot of other writers, what will matter is that those who know the grand vision, see fit to bring it back and restore it to the glory and great vision it represents.All throughout Next Gen, DS9 and Voyager we witnessed moments where Starfleet was not as perfect as it should have been. Even in The original series it was not without it's flaws(how about the wrongful trial of Kirk for example without the full facts.) So this is no stranger to Gene's vision and I believe in the end is going to enhance it by seeing ex captain Picard end up without knowing it, bring back the golden age, but it's going to take some doing and this series is without doubt geared around that premise.So far it's amazing and any negative nay sayers, can go and watch Star Trek Discovery if you really want to know what bad Star Trek is, then perhaps they will quit there winging and enjoy it for what it is. A glimpse into Picards future and what he does to set it right.Evil triumphs when good people fail to do nothing and Picard is not one of those individuals, no matter what his age.Amazing performances for all actors but Patrick Stewert you are incredible and I hope you win an Academy award for this role because you seriously deserve it.Look forward to seeing the next episode and here's to a great Star Trek future,\nSean.","rating":"10\/10","date":"25 January 2020"}
{"title":"Thank you, Sir Patrick","review":"Thank you, Sir Patrick Stewart, for saving the Star Trek franchise from itself, and for doing such a fine job at it.I think we finally have a Star Trek series again, and a very good one. I was very disappointed and pessimistic about Star Trek's future after abandoning 'Discovery'.While It is not optimistic that we had to turn to the most important figure in the development and cultivation of the star trek legend (which is Sir Patrick's Captain Picard), the return to star trek values as are evident in the scientific, moral and political questions raised in the plot is paramount and more timely than ever.I don't want to give away any spoilers. If you consider yourself a star trek fan, do yourself a favor and take the time to watch the first episode. It's brilliant.","rating":"8\/10","date":"29 January 2020"}
{"title":"Sad and disappointed.","review":"Being a long star trek fan, having watched through all the ST series including the somewhat un star trek discovery, I felt compelled to write a review in the vague hope and plea to the writers and producers of the show to salvage the disappointing first 2 episodes.\nThe good\n-stunning visually\n-great acting from Patrick StewartHere comes the really bad\n-what s with the f-word in star trek and intimate bed room scene? I watched a lot of 18+ movies with swearing\/nudity etc and Given the amount that I can swear at times, I'm rather shocked this was in Ep2. Very un star trek.plot is slowit's too dark and dystopic - almost blade runner feeldialogues feel more like a drama soap seriesep1 was promising but ep2 was disappointing.some of the scifi ideas are not plausible even with the stretch of imagination. C'mon man, \"they are created in pairs\"? I can accept the 'synthetics' went rogue but for star Fleet to ban them seems quite far fetch and rubbish plot for that contradicts supposedly forward thinking ideals of what star fleet represents? . I hope the later episodes will reveal this more? But please do it quickly and not drag this out the entire season.Picard dreams and flashback a bit overdone and slows the pace of the showThe makers of the orville get it. But sadly not this series.\nI hope the producers and writers are able to hear what the fans are saying and make season 2 better.... If it survives another season. I remain hopeful...","rating":"3\/10","date":"3 February 2020"}

{"title":"Disappointing","review":"I am a big Star Trek fan and was excited to watch a new series especially one with Sir Patrick Stewart. Other than a lazy reliance on nostalgia, there was nothing of substance in the series. I continued watching the series hoping it would get better and it never did. If you are a huge TNG fan you might enjoy part of it but don't expect anything new, creative, or thought out. It comes of as a half-baked plot thrown together as an excuse to get Captain Picard involved, and a pathetic attempt to coax Star Trek fans into subscribing to CBS.","rating":"3\/10","date":"16 July 2020"}

I cant remember the last time I was waiting for the release of an episode of a tv show.Definitely, Picard and the rest of his crew deserved ten more seasons, it felt so good to watch this entire season.I'm not sure what they were trying to do during the first two, and I wasn't sure why I kept watching this, but the reward came and it all made sense.So glad to watch good content and eager to watch the future content, hoping they can keep the quality and lore of this third season into the next productions of star trek.","rating":"10\/10","date":"25 April 2023"}
{"title":"SSN 2 is a mess.","review":"Not sure why they changed writers from seasons one to two but it was a mistake. Season one was incredibly entertaining. The plot was interesting and none of the episodes dragged. Season two however, I find myself reluctantly slogging through each episode. I regularly end up grimacing at the really dumb decisions everyone is making or the very cheesy lines they are saying. This season had such potential! Q and Borg? But instead I have to resist the urge to fast forward thru the boring bits... which there are a lot of. This season is too heavily weighted toward character study with very little focus on what could have been one of the best plot lines in Star Trek. It frankly has almost no sense of Star Trek appeal thanks to some overly heavy subject matter that is like a sledge hammer to the face. Previous actors are brought back with no real purpose and only serve to clutter up a sloppy plot line. So they go back in time and tell themselves... \"don't let them know we are here!\" and what does Rios do?! Bring a couple people back to his ship and show off all the technology!! You've got to be kidding me. They also leave their tec all over the place, get arrested (several times) and get caught doing future stuff on camera. They are written like a bunch of bumbling morons. I only hope the writers of ssn 3 are better at what they do.","rating":"10\/10","date":"1 May 2022"}
{"title":"A 10 only for season 3!!!","review":"The first 2 seasons were ok; nothing more or less. There were even moments when my attention got lost...but season 3- OMG! The real TNG- pure nostalgia! The music and even the blue font looks like TNG! I really love that all the crew members stayed true to themselves, but also wonderfully evolved! One of my favourites was Worf; who really wasn't one of my favourite characters in TNG, but I love him here! Deanna Troi and Riker-also great story and chemistry. Really, all the characters and the actors from the original cast were great\nI also loved very much captain Shaw!

Well I have to say congratulations to the writers, directors, producers and of course the beloved cast. They pulled it off beautifully. I cried at the end of series 3.

{"title":"Ultra Violence, Obscenity and a discount production","review":"This show has zero connection to the Trek canon, as most of us would imagine it. It feels like it is written on-the-fly, with little consideration to consistency or world building. But most of all, this is not Trek.It is ultra-violent. Sadistically so. I am not a fan . Yet they needed to show one of the most vulnerable Voyager characters being brutally tortured, over and over. I never watched those evil torture movies that were popular in the early 00s but I definitely get that vibe from Star Trek Picard.It's unoriginal. We don't need to see creepy bro\/sis action in Star Trek. No one ever woke up one day saying, \"hey you know what Star Trek needs? Derivative Game of Thrones reject actors hamming it up with their best\/worst Cerci Lannister impersonations\".It's boring. I mean really, really, really boring. It just drones on and on, with actors you don't want to watch in scenes that shouldn't exist.It's hopeless. and dark. and depressing. It is a repudiation of Star Trek: TNG and I am truly baffled the TNG gang want anything to do with it.It's badly written and directed. It feels like amateur hour at the community theater. I can't see this having a budget, it all looks and feels cheap as well.This is not sci-fi. It's woke-fi. Meandering, disjointed, amoral and without purpose.","rating":"1\/10","date":"29 February 2020"}
{"title":"Treat Each Season as standalone story","review":"Im a fan of all sci-fi and Picard is added to my all time faves, its a shame its just three seasons long, ive enjoyed each and every season, and especially the reprisal of various roles from previous series, esp. The OG borg queen.The final season, season 3, is by far the best of the three, the story had me on edge for every episode and there was no lul in the action, the original NG crew slowly turning up each week added to that excitement, i did miss the chance for them to write Wesley into the story as he is barely mentioned.My only real issue is the writing, if you watch each season as a stand alone show then it works but it was really frustrating that the continuity of each season ifs completely erased...apart from Picard getting his android body,,, thats it!, even the borg turning up in season 2, which could have been really helpful in season 3.This is a must for any start trek fan, with this ending and the final season of discovery coming soon lets hope strange new worlds has a few seasons to go.","rating":"9\/10","date":"25 April 2023"}

{"title":"Perfect show, start to finish.","review":"I think it's understood now that the question at the end of each review, \"Was this review helpful?\" with a Yes or No button, is not really a sign of the reader's \"helpfulness\" rating, but whether they agree or disagree with the review. With that said, and based on other reviews, I'd expect the No ratio on this review to be pretty high.I simply loved this show from start to finish. Each season being its own story arc was a brilliant idea, with, I suppose, the show never quite knowing whether they'd be renewed or not. Surprisingly, the last season, which was announced well before it started airing, is the only one with a \"cliffhanger,\" of sorts. But it's also safe to ignore it and be none the less for it. I mean, I would probably watch the show that is suggested in the last few minutes of the finale, but I'll also probably forget about it in a few weeks.I see a large number of reviews concentrating praise on Season 3, and trashing Seasons 1 and 2. That was not my experience. Season 1, bringing Picard back to space was well done, and introduced compelling characters along the way. The story also tied back to the original series and filled in some of the story holes that were left.Season 2: The Borg are back, what's not to love? The Borg are the TOP villains of, maybe, the entire franchise, so I really don't understand anyone who loves Star Trek finding the 2nd season anything but compelling.Season 3, that everyone else seems to find perfect, is the one with some issues; the biggest one being the sudden replacement of the new Borg Queen introduced in Season 2 gone and finding the Alice Krige Borg Queen in her place in Season 3. I assume there's only ONE Borg Queen, so I don't know what that was about. Other than that, some of the writing in Season 3 seemed lazy, while 1 and 2 were fresh. It's actually, for me, Season 3 that was the least compelling. But I'm a viewer that enjoys change and stories that continue and expand, and Season 3 seemed to rehash old Star Trek: TNG dialogue and situations that now seem tired.And the swearing! I loved it! Star Trek has always been a little too sanitized for me, so the swearing was a welcome addition, showing that the characters talked and acted like real people and not cardboard cutouts. It's also worth noting that our entertainment reflects the times. When TNG premiered in the late 80s, it was a great show for that time. We were coming out of the \"Greed is Good\" decade, and TNG was a tonic to that. Now, of course, the whole world seems in chaos, and ST: Picard reflected that. There's more violence, more swearing, and more darkness. This is a show that needs to be watched in the dark because so much of it IS literally dark. The bridges are all low lighting, the hallways, even conference rooms and what they chose to put in the holodeck. It's a dark place -- much more \"Alien\" and less \"TNG.\"But, overall, for me, a GREAT show. Due to how channels and services have abruptly ended shows for the past several years, I don't watch anything until it's completely over, so I binged the whole series in about a week or so. Watching it that way turns it into three very long movies, and I highly recommend watching it that way. You can take a break between seasons because of the show's structure. ST: Picard turned out to be all I hoped it would be and I can highly recommend it.","rating":"10\/10","date":"20 March 2024"}
{"title":"Star Trek is back!","review":"Short version (and personal):\nSeason 1: creative, imaginative, heartwarming (with an overdone ending, but we all love Riker, right?)\nSeason 2: ultimate disaster (I gave up all hope)\nSeason 3: More than I could have hoped for...Long version:\nSeason 1 started off very exciting and the plot and setting were creative and new territory that fit into the Star Trek universe (except maybe the synth plot line, which was a bit weak for a 24th century civilisation who had AI's helping out already on the Enterprise D).Season 2: suffered through it, because I am in heart a trekkie. But man, was that suffering (there was at least 1 exciting and funny character).Season 3: This whole review would be a 8-Star rating because of season 2, but season 3 blew me away!

{"title":"Ready to Watch It Again","review":"Season 3 has felt like an eight hour ride of the best of the best of TNG. I am so sad that this is the end, but so incredibly satisfied with this season. To have all the characters that we have loved over the years return for such an elegantly written ten- show series was wonderful.Unlike a few other final show episodes this past year, this series carried the thrill, the anticipation, to the very end. You truly did not know who would be coming out alive and who would not until the show's ending and that kept me glued to the screen until the remaining seconds.I started screening this season three days ago. I am done. I know that I have to watch it again because I know I will see things the second time I missed initially.I don't think you will find any part of the season lacking. Everything builds upon the previous shows and nothing is left out there leaving you wondering or questioning.Thank you to everyone who has made TNG and Picard so special.","rating":"10\/10","date":"14 September 2023"}
{"title":"Just Watch Season 3","review":"When Picard first aired, I was advised by other fans I trust not to watch because it wasn't worth the money to get Paramount+.Enter Terry Matalas, executive producer for season 3 and massive Trekkie. Everyone said it was fantastic, so I skipped the first two seasons and started on the third. It lived up to the hype. Terry is clearly a huge Star Trek fan and made sure to put in tons of fan service while staying respectful of the character development and plot. (If you start on the third season like I did, you may be confused about a couple minor details I assume were part of the first two, but the main plot isn't affected at all.)As someone who grew up on TNG and Voyager, seeing the characters I know and love again brought me so much joy. They felt fresh yet familiar, and the regular jokes about all their aches, pains, and wrinkles made me giggle constantly. The new characters were really well developed and endearing too, and I look forward to seeing them in the next season. (The Eragon fangirl in me was stoked to see Ed Speelers get to shine in something well written.)I honestly wasn't expecting the plot to be very good, but it blew me away. Constant twists and turns, and the villain was phenomenal. Also, the music was so atmospheric and beautiful while still bringing in those familiar themes.Overall, season 3 was a blast, and I hope Terry Matalas stays involved for all future seasons. Season 3 was a prime example of how you do a reboot that fans will actually enjoy.","rating":"9\/10","date":"3 June 2023"}

{"title":"Too much Picard and not enough Star Trek","review":"Oh dear, this really hasn't lived up to my expectations. It's painfully slow and so boring at times I skip forward which is something I have never done watching Star Trek. Jean-Luc Picard seems to have morphed into a Star Trek version of Yoda making long endless profound speeches that Shakespeare would have been proud of but are in fact mind numbingly boring. The long and frequent dreams of Picard's past are pointless and serve no purpose whatsoever for the plot. If it wasn't for the return of Q I'm not sure I would have continued watching. Star Trek Picard is far too much Picard and not nearly enough Star Trek in my opinion.","rating":"10\/10","date":"26 May 2022"}
{"title":"So sad to see what's being done to Trek","review":"I grew up watching The Next Generation, Deep Space Nine, and Voyager, and whilst I initially didn't like the last two, I've now rewatched all three series several times, and enjoy them all. TNG, DS9 and VOY are what Trek is all about. These new Treks are garbage. Enterprise was the first let down, then this recent Discovery nonsense with Klingons that don't even look like Klingons, and now Picard where nothing is as it should be.I'm just going to keep rewatching the only three good Treks that ever existed, and even though I never really got into the original series, I would be better of watching that and developing an appreciation for Gene's original vision that giving any of this new junk the time of day.","rating":"4\/10","date":"20 February 2020"}

They're nothing special, but mildly enjoyable.I wasn't even looking out for season 3 but noticed it released and gave it a try. I'm glad I did because it's been incredible.The story telling has been fantastic, it feels updated yet nostalgic, without all of the wokeness you see in recent reboots. The introduction of the old gang doesn't feel forced and tied up a lot of old story lines.If you can't be bothered with season 1&2, the 3rd season will work independently.

{"title":"One of the greatest achievements in motion picture history","review":"Star Trek Picard should have started with season three. Everything in season three is what we fans were waiting for with this renewal of Star Trek.But Star Trek Picard is not just a renewal. It's an achievement and it will be viewed in the future as one of the greatest achievements in motion picture history.With season three we have not just the renewal of a television series, it is more like a fundamental spiritual renewal which both the fans and clearly the actors and everyone involved in production experienced.Without knowing the full history, one senses that this fundamental renewal began with an epiphany that happened with Patrick Stewart. In season three of Picard that epiphany, that vision has come to full fruition.I give this series the highest rating not only for all this, but because in its own right the level of Picard is excellent as a drama and science fiction series in its own right. Even to someone who might never have faithfully watched every episode of Next Generation, the episodes in Picard enthrall, captivate, and move the viewers. From exaltation to despair and everything in between, Picard will take you on a great ride, a great adventure.Thank you, Patrick Stewart and all others behind this vision, for carrying forward and giving the world something beautiful!----------- Below is content of my previous edit ---------------For anyone who tuned out after season one I recommend to try watching again with season 3.Yes season one was painful. Picard was so out of character. So many scenes were ponderous and just wasted time. Entire plot lines went nowhere.

{"title":"Haters want to hate because they want STNG with better special effects, not a character driven story about a vulnerable Captain Picard searching for meaning in his life.","review":"Star Trek Picard is certainly not great TV or great Star Trek but it is a good show with the potential to be great.There isn't a single Star Trek series that has been great from the first season. It might be the curse of Gene Roddenberry but every Star Trek series stumbles out of the gate. My eight stars rating is based on the fact that this denied season is maybe the second best debut season after Deep Space Nine's debut season.I've been watching Trek since the beginning (ok, almost beginning, I was 11 months old when it started, lol) and this certainly is a new vision for Star Trek. Watching the after show hosted by Will Weston, \"Ready Room\" available on CBS all access and YouTube has helped me understand why they made some of the controversial creative decisions that have rubbed some dabs the wrong way and I'm firmly in the camp of patiently letting the story unfold to justify those bold choices rather than passing snap judgement based on an expectation that this would simply be a modern update of the Next Generation formula of Star Trek story telling.From the first time Sir Patrick Stewart announced the show two years ago on the Comic Con stage describing it as something new and different, we have been told over and over this want going to be your parents version of Star Trek. The food of sour grapes from people who wanted more of the same old formula are useless and uninformative about what is good or disappointing in Start Trek Picard. They are only a laundry list of the differences between preconceived expectations and a bold new story.I recommends classic Star Trek fans watch the series as if it had no past history and evaluate it solely on its own merits and not against preconceived expectations. If you do that you will discover an interesting story with complex the dimensional flawed characters and an idealistic world no longer living up to its ideals and struggling to recapture it's soul.I think this is a compelling start to a new journey and I'm eager to learn where this is headed. It isn't peak TV but it certainly is good TV.","rating":"8\/10","date":"8 March 2020"}
{"title":"Despite some interesting characters, a flat generic version of Star Trek","review":"The series is now finished and it's a real mixed bag.Even though it's only 10 episodes long, the story progresses at a snails pace until the last 3 episodes. I am a fan of steadier story telling but the early episodes didn't really justify their slow pace and didn't use them for anything very interesting, oddly the last few episodes feel really rushed like they are cramming everything in even though they had plenty of time earlier.It may not sound like I'm giving good reasons for a rating as high as 3 stars but there was also a lot to like here. For the most part Picard feels like an older more tired version of himself from TNG, although he doesn't always. The new characters are mostly likeable and interesting although feel like they had one purpose on the show and then just hung around for the rest of the season, I can think of atleast 3 characters that fall into this trope. Some older characters get some really nice closure and tender moments that they didn't get in previous films and series, without giving anything away.For me Star Trek has always or mostly taken sci-fi ideas and have created very unique stories with them. Sadly this isn't the case with Picard just like discovery. Picards over arching story will be very familiar to a lot of sci-fi fans, I won't say what but it completely rips off a central story of another very popular sci-fi franchise, which there is just no excuse for, it's actually quite hilarious how exactly the same it is, I thought they would have atleast tried to disguise it more.Despite how it sounds I am trying to be objective and not all negative but am also trying to be honest. I believe the current production team behind current Star Trek needs to change completely. Discovery and Picard hasn't really felt like sci-fi to me and has been what I would call Science fantasy, similar to doctor who. There is nothing scientific on display here just plot devices and conveniences that seem like magic sometimes but we are told are some kind of technology.I really think Star Trek needs to get back to its roots and be put in the hands of people who have a passion for the franchise.","rating":"5\/10","date":"28 March 2020"}

Sure, reviews, shouldn't be robotically analytical, but 1's and 2's simply show nothing but the reviewer's personal issues with a show, as if butthurt.A lot of reviews here are titled, \"This is not Star Trek\"... well, sorry to say....it is.I was too young to see TOS first-hand, but grew up watching the movies, and was nearing my teenage years when TNG hit our TV's.I loved The Next Gen. It was my generation's definitive Star Trek series. Even closely followed by DS9, Voyager and Enterprise, (all great series' in their own rights), none ever matched the brilliance of Picard's Enterprise and her crew.Now, 26 years years after the final episode of The Next Generation (and 18 years after the last Next Gen movie), these characters (in part) are back.Is it the same as the Star Trek series' that have graced our screens in the past? No, it is not.\nIs that a bad thing?\nNo, it is not.This show is more a character study than the old fashioned style, \"new dilemma fixed in 45 minutes\" (unless it's a super dilemma and requires 2 parts) format of the older series'. So some say this format makes the show boring. To that I shrug and say....okay. I, personally am not finding it boring at all.The world has changed in the last 20 odd years. So has entertainment. The shows we watch, the movies we watch and how they're all written, have all changed. As is the way always in entertainment.Entertainment has to evolve, like everything else and Star Trek, a show about humanity and the positive future of it, is all about evolution and progress.I think the irony of a Star Trek fan who does not want the franchise to evolve, is highly amusing indeed.Some people are saying it is too politically correct. I haven't gotten that feeling whilst watching the first 7 episodes, and I'm not a big fan of over-political correctness at all.To me, it feels true to what Star Trek has always been about.\nExploring the heart of humanity.","rating":"9\/10","date":"8 March 2020"}
{"title":"Season 3 of Picard best Trek since DS9\/Voyager","review":"Seasons 1 and 2 were a little rocky of Picard however Season 3 was a true love letter to TNG era fans and many great nods and callbacks to TOS, DS9, and Voyager fans.So many great moments in Season 3 and so many amazing performances by the cast. The story, the acting, the music score of season 3, and the overall heart of Season 3 makes it perhaps the best season of a Trek series since DS9 seasons 4-7 and Voyager season 4-5.Some revisits of beloved franchises recently have missed the mark but Season 3 of Picard is what Top Gun Maverick was to Top Gun fans.I truly hope there is a spinoff series and its called Star Trek: Legacy.","rating":"8\/10","date":"19 March 2020"}
{"title":"Abomination","review":"My favorite show of all time is Star Trek:TNG. It's wonderful in such a myriad of ways. It also taught or reinforced for me so many of my core values and principles. I learned to appreciate great storytelling, and the show inspired me to pursue a life long love of good literature.This horribly awful show has done the one thing I thought could never be done. It's made me dislike Star Trek a little. I will never forgive these hack writers and producers.","rating":"1\/10","date":"5 May 2022"}
{"title":"Reviews reviewing the show per episode rather than a series as a whole","review":"We were told this wasn't going to be the same Star Trek. We were told that jean luc would be in a totally different position and frame of mind. It's a very different world from the world we left off and in many aspects, Gene's envisioned world is yet to come which is why every Star Trek series resonates in today's world. One of the biggest reasons as to why we didn't see more Star Trek series is because they simply ran out of stories. Many of the episodic stories were being repeated. Star Trek Picard is a narrative driven series (like discovery) rather than each episode having its own uniqueness which is why it seems so different. It's building the foundations of a story and taking us on a journey to a conclusion like most tv series' today.This review has been made literally after season 1 episode 4 but already it's grasped on so many things that the previous tv shows have laid down foundations. The biggest two being, the misuse and abuse of android tech and the federation as being held back by the political. The Captain in every series has had to struggle with the restraints of the federation, Picard less so due to his stern and strong beliefs in it. It is completely in character for him to remove himself from the federation after they left the romulan race to die as probably the main reason for his departure. I'm sure we will learn that the federation dug their own grave in regards to the android synth tech mainly because of the data and doctor bashir stories.Each episode seems to be designated to introducing the new characters but their introduction is interwoven into progressing the story. Rather than each episode having some sort of social meaning behind it, these characters I predict, when all together, will convey a united social message rather than individual characters being designated with individual stories with individual social meanings in the story being told like told in previous Trek.Absolutely loving it so far, feel as if I'm back into the Star Trek universe","rating":"9\/10","date":"14 February 2020"}
{"title":"Missing the staples of good Trek","review":"ST: Picard throws us into an almost dystopian future, where Picard seems to be the only one left who cares enough to try fixing things. Everyone else is off here or there pursuing their own selfish desires, giving Picard his one and only true role for the movie: A nostalgic Gandalf of the Star Trek universe. He's been turned into this weird, connected-in-some-way-to-everyone motivational speaker running from one place to the other rallying everyone to his cause.I've been watching star trek episodes almost every week for over 15 years. There's a certain algorithm (or theme, if you will) to Star Trek inherent in the majority of the episodes that dedicated fans should be very familiar with. This algorithm consists of 3 main overarching points that Gene Roddenberry wanted to convey to his audiences.1. We (as a people) are flawed, arrogant, and self-obsessed; and we need to improve ourselves. (This is very biblical, by the way.) I listed this first because I believe it's the most important theme in Star Trek.2. The future is bright, because humanity \"has grown out of its infancy\".3. Life, in any form, is important and should be protected from harm, even if it's hostile toward you.These themes are not present in Star Trek: Picard. The directors\/writers came up with some interesting plots, back stories and action sequences, and while these are necessary parts of a good tv show, Star Trek at its core does not revolve around them in the slightest. Star Trek is about the internal struggles of the characters; their growth, their failures, their struggle to get past all the $H1T us humans obsess over, like the want for power\/money, our egos, self-indulgence, devaluing others, etc etc etc. There's a very long list, as humans are a very F'd up species to say the least. These things connect us with the characters. Star Trek is also about the characters' love, excitement and optimism about this paradise they live in. The future is supposed to be happy. Humanity has evolved past all the stupidity of it's past. We are an enlightened, enthusiastic people; eager to get out into the unknown. ST: Picard just doesn't have any of that. It's just.. wrong.To be fair, staying true to the \"grand design\" of the original Star Trek creator probably wasn't what the writers were hired to do. Obviously the writers are just trying to \"sell\" a product, and don't have the creative liberty that the Star Trek writers of old did. I guess I can't blame them for that, as we all have a job to do at the end of the day. Maybe they can hire a crazy Trek fan as a consultant?I do really like that Star Trek is still \"a thing\", and that some of my favorite actors of the past are getting roles again and making some extra dough. Hopefully they can bring back all the others, like Dorn, Brooks, Crosby, Combs, Auberjonois, Shimerman, McFadden, Visitor, etc.","rating":"2\/10","date":"17 August 2021"}

{"title":"Masterpiece & and a Proper Return to Course","review":"I never cared for the original Star Trek, I admit it. But I loved the Next Generation, Deep Space Nine, and Voyager so much I have watched them at least twice each (which, for how shows used to run and seven seasons each is a bit of a commitment). Enterprise was...good; Enterprise was good, I think I can say that. The new Star Trek movies...I mean, if they weren't Star Trek, maybe? And I should add I've not watched Discovery. But this feels...I want to say like coming home, but that isn't quite right because coming home is an end, a return. This is more of an opening up, a broadening. This is what should have happened after Enterprise, and before the entertainment industry got so bloody reboot happy. I don't know where this series or this franchise goes from here, but if only for this one brief season I am filled with a hope that the deep and beautiful potential that was TNG, DS9, & Voyager are once again being lived up to, and possibly even surpassed. I would say if you are an old fan watch it, but I simply cannot imagine someone who loved TNG needing to be told to do so.Afterthought: I wrote this before reading any of the other reviews, and...I don't want to let this devolve into social commentary, but for the sake of something good and wonderful: it is profoundly disheartening to see the extent to which we live in an era of profound cynicism. No, nothing is ever really perfect, and no, we cannot go back to our loves of the past. As someone who deeply loves Star Wars, I am sickened by what has been done to those movies, and I all too thoroughly understand the violation of art out of ignorance or for personal profit, yet I nonetheless hold out hope as some better shows have come around. I cannot for the life of me understand how someone who likes Star Trek could watch this series and come away saying such awful things unless their heart is simply full of bile. This series is different, it has a different tone, true, but it also has a deep sense of meaning, purpose, and theme. It is not an empty and flashy quick sell, nor is it a pandering to nostalgia. I love the older series of Star Trek in much the way as I love an old friend, and it is this same sense of feeling that has made me so sick with many of the new Star Trek and Star Wars movies: they are empty, artless, soulless, and targeted only toward gathering as much money as they can. This series truly has both heart and art, and it is a shame that those so filled with toxic cynicism cannot appreciate something so wonderful and precious in an era where so much good art has withered and died.","rating":"10\/10","date":"29 March 2020"}

{"title":"Haters are clueless, this is high quality Trek, and then some!","review":"When I read some of the reviews here, I get very sad. How can anyone call this excellent show a letdown? I tend to think that those haters have either lost their minds or have no idea what quality tv is. Picard is truly magnificent tv, and here's why:it connects flawlessly to the Next Generation tv-series, with lots of cool references to some of its best episodes.it connects flawlessly to the Voyager tv-series, with references to its best episodes.it connects flawlessly to the Nemesis movie, taking the best elements out of it and elaborating on those.it picks up the story of Picard about 20 years after Nemesis, as if the camera was turned off and now turned on again.it fills in some of the gap between Nemesis and now, revealing more information with every episode.Patrick Stewart is still a brilliant actor, reprising his role as Picard brilliantlythe story grabs you from the beginning, and keeps gripping you even more after several episodes.it's imaginative, and it makes you think about what happened to Picard and all the other TNG characters in the past 20 years.it triggers the imagination and builds on the good memories.it looks stunningly beautiful and high-tech.These are only a few of the many reasons why this show is so brilliant. If you can't see that, you have absolutely no clue about what good tv is supposed to be. So to all the haters I say this: please stop make a fool of yourselves by writing stupid remarks, because this show is smarter than you. Deal with it. Either stop watching or start enjoying. Your choice.","rating":"10\/10","date":"21 February 2020"}
{"title":"I Really wanted to like this but its Dull and Boring","review":"I have watched all the trek series since trek began and its amazing how the Newer renditions, be it Picard or Discovery\ntend to pale when compared to the Original star trek with kirk and spock..Those stories,were extremely well written and hold up even today..Sure the effects cant hold a candle to anything made today but trek wasnt supposed to be about the effects, it was about the human condition, our desire to explore and break boundries and do so while keeping our humanity...The picard series, although im only 4 episodes in, is Really a yawn fest that has a dull and boring quality about it that stems from the show fixating and exhalting its main character...Sadly, picard himself is the Least interesting of the bunch and his acting is easily eclipsed by many of the supporting characters around him..The scripts keep trying to divert the story to him but picard is not an interesting enough nor well acted enough character to hold attention and it just feel like its plodding along going nowhere...Maybe it just needs time, as all new shows do..Certainly discovery needed time and Still needs time as that show is Barely better than picard and thats not saying much...Both of these shows are a low point, sadly, in the star trek saga but I believe in giving them time to get their footing..Hopefully they will pay attention to what fans have observed and suggested and take the writing in better directions..None of the trek shows can survive on CGI alone ,no matter how stellar it is..Good stories, that show hope for humanities future are the key...show mankind as having passed Thru the fire, having Evolved, not as so many shows make the mistake of portraying us as no better than we are now, meaning basically that we have learned nothing and are still perpetuating war,pettiness,violence and division...Rodenberry had Vision and that Creative vision was apparant in shows like Earth Final Conflict...amazing the stories in that show so long ago and the vision in it...We can do better writing than what we are seeing here in Picard and the 1st step is to make the show less ego centric around its central character and for God sake, stop portraying him as \"saintly \" like he is some kind of messiah...expand the focus to those around him and get the story out into space where trek was meant to be...","rating":"3\/10","date":"18 February 2020"}

{"title":"Long time Trek fan. This is absolute garbage.","review":"No this is worse than garbage because garbage is at least self contained. This new \"trek\" show has literally nothing in it from any of the good trek. It's as generic of a syfy show as it could possibly be. I'm not one of those people who complains about the progressive stuff in the show. Star Trek has always been about that, but it's also been able characters with a certain moral fortitude being put in situations that test them as a way to explore humanity. This show is not that at all. It's like watching Nemesis, but longer. Actually no, Nemesis was better than this.I didn't have high hopes for this show seeing as they manage to mess up every attempt to make new trek since Voyager, but I figured it would at least be decent and not something that would straight up piss me off. The leaps they make with the plot are so egregious that there is just no way to logically connect this series of events to TNG.I am also let down by Patrick Stewart, who has said in multiple interviews that he was going to turn this down but the plot was just too good. I'd sure like to have some of what he's smoking because this is the worse thing to happen to trek, like ever. If this isn't the final nail in the coffin, IDK what possible could be. At this point I hope it is because it's clear CBS is entirely incapable of producing a trek that fan will actually like so they might as well stop ruining it.","rating":"1\/10","date":"7 February 2020"}
{"title":"Promising","review":"After watching the first 4 episodes I think that while this is not TNG, but potentially something that could be much better.

I can't believe all the hate so early as we are still getting to know most of the characters. I'm intrigued as to where the plot is going and I think there are some really promising ideas in this series. The acting is good and the production values are very high. I'm looking forward to where it is leading.","rating":"9\/10","date":"17 February 2020"}

Really?Apart from the (what should be accountable) atrociously bad handling of the Star Trek, here is why and where it failed:We have had series ST, DS9, TNG etc that were, for the most part, one episode one story approaches. Or, we have had movies.

It's like they are trying so hard to make references and callbacks that they forget to make a good story. It's as if they had no idea what they wanted to do with the series and were just winging it. Well I just read an interview with Goldsman, and he pretty much admitted that they are just winging it. They don't have a story planned out and are just making it up as they go, and it shows.

It is House of Cards quality and not mired in political correctness. I am a Star Trek fan. I have seen every episode of every live action series, and Lower Decks. I am inclined to like it, but what impresses me are the people who experience it for the first time and are hooked.I see what is likely an organized group of \"purists\" who trash it.

Don't listen to the naysayers. This is far closer to Gene Roddenberry's vision than we've seen in a long time. Discovery is ok, but this is far superior. I like the new characters, and I love how they not only brought back some of the old characters, but how those characters have grown and changed over the years. I like that it wasn't a typical \"star fleet\" plot. This promises to be a great series. It has enough action to keep it interesting, but it's really character driven. Such a refreshing change and so reminiscent of the old Star Treks. There were a few spots that were a bit predictable and a little on the sappy side - mostly in the last two episodes - and the characters still need to be fleshed out a bit more, but overall good job! I am really looking forward to season 2.","rating":"8\/10","date":"7 April 2020"}

It would be good to explore the Star Trek universe outside of the Federation ships and this series starts this off.\nI would recommend this series for people with a appreciation of Sci Fi but not the cult followers.\nHarry Treadaway gave a lot of depth to the normally dry personalities of the romulans.\nI was slightly disappointed with Seven of Nine as her character no longer matched the Voyager series and was more reminiscent of Sarah Connor in Terminator 2.\nThe captain smoking a cigar made no sense, I can only assume the series was funded by the Tobacco industry.\nI summary it could have been better, but no where as near as bad as the other ratings say,. Hopefully feedback will be taken on board for series two.\nIn comparison to Discovery with the ridiculous Klingons, this series was a lot truer to the Star Trek franchise.","rating":"8\/10","date":"6 April 2020"}

{"title":"What is the goal here?","review":"This in not a Star Trek showThis is a deconstruction of Star Trek show.Up until this point Starfleet was a moral and virtuous group. Something to aspire to, a world in which poverty and war had been eliminated.Now 4 Bolsheviks are recruited as writers, and they create a world where Starfleet is evil, uncaring and full of cursing harridans.Its clear money has been spent and effort expended but for what? Something that, especially after Star Trek Discovery, kills any last remaining sparkle that this universe might contain. It certainly isn't Star Trek as the vast majority of fans might recognise.Why? What is the goal here? You're certainly going to lose money, but kill a franchise for good measure?","rating":"1\/10","date":"18 February 2020"}
{"title":"..","review":"Best! Best! Best!So, episode two makes it clear that the Enterprise crew is still a close-knit family that would do anything for Picard. However, Picard doesn't want to get them involved, so they don't really show up. That's fair, fans can understand that. It's still a huge mystery, though, what they've been up to. And even more of a mystery what Picard's role was in all of it.Trekkies get they all parted ways and had their own lives, but has he been avoiding them, or did he come to all their weddings and baby showers and still sees them sometimes? Where has their relationship gone after fans stopped watching? Trekkies fell in love with the TNG cast, so that's part of Picard's history they'd love to know.","rating":"10\/10","date":"12 February 2020"}

{"title":"Not gonna be negative just to try and show I am the biggest fan","review":"Star Trek is a mirror. It's strengths lie in how it portrays humanity - or maybe a version of humanity we'd like to believe we're not very far away from. The trouble is, The Next Generation, though an outstanding oiece if late eighties television, could often be too perfect. Too sickly sweet. People would fall out then smile it off at the end of the episode. There were rarely consequences. And then came Deep Space Nine... Something people are only really appreciating in retrospect. Lets not forget the original show here, an egocentric and obsessive Captain, tortured second in command, bad tempered doctor and cranky (and possibly) alcoholic engineer. Yes, the best Trek series had the most flawed characters, in the optimistic setting of the show. An optimism that emerged from the 1960s that saw the world move to the brink of a (nuclear) third world war, a cold war, a war in Vietnam.Its something we've forgotten in a world where political uncertainty is strife. Where economic fragility is glossed over. Where isolationalist nationalism has replaced globalisation. We are, once again, in uncertain times. And we need positivity.What this series has done is begin in a less certain Trek universe than the one we left. A post (Dominion) war where the universe we knew was turned on it's head. Bit like the 1950s? And to remind us, this show has mirrored that. Throw in fear of AI, terrorism(?) and racial tension, Star Trek has once again mirrored the time.What Picard will ultimately demonstrate is how we can either focus on that negativity, or listen to people (like Picard) and work towards a positive outlook society had perhaps forgotten. And to show us that, it begins in a dark place.And I think that is great. I am a life long (42 and counting), devout Trekkie. And I feel this series is soeaking to us about the world we are in now - and what needs to be done to get us to the bright Trek future Gene Roddenberry created. Flawed characters that work together, perfect in their imperfections - and in those of other people.Picard has a story to tell, and a legacy to leave.Embrace it.","rating":"8\/10","date":"2 March 2020"}

{"title":"NOT Star Trek","review":"Putting Star Trek characters into a show does not make it Star Trek. Where is space exploration? Where is the science? Is there even a point to this show? The answer is not in this show.\nThis is like a single episode of any other Star Trek show or maybe a movie stretched out to hours and hours of bad TV drama. If you were going to go the route of a single plot spanning the entire season or even series at least do what DS9 did and still have episodes that have their own story and frame them in the larger one.\nI love Patrick Stewart but no matter how he tries to make something out of his character this Picard just has no depth. As the matter of fact none of the characters have depth or even purpose except for wasting time and pointless conversations about feelings. Yeah, I get it, we all have feelings they get hurt we get ... can we now go find some strange alien life forms already?\nWe do not need gunfights in each episode. We need good stories that tickle the mind and the imagination. There is plenty of violence on TV but no such shows as TNG. TNG was about human values and adventure, and science and wit concurring the galaxy. I'm not even going to mention any other Star Trek series.This Star Trek is no different from any other show on TV, these days, except for different name for their guns.\nIn conclusion, if you are a Star Trek fan look somewhere else.","rating":"3\/10","date":"21 February 2020"}
{"title":"New Star Trek Paradox","review":"This is my first review, so bare with me.I've been a Star Trek fan as long as I remember. Born in 75, I grew up dreaming on the imaginary of Gene Roddenberry.The premisse of the original series was simple enough: humanity advanced to a higher level and no longer had to endure the difficulties of nowadays.\nPeople were better in every way, at least the human sort. The bad guys weren't human, they were Klingons and Humans were better then Klingons, because they were human. They had compassion and values we all identify with.Later, there were Romulans and Borg to worry about (on different ages), maybe that's why humanity united and forgot their petty quarrels.Star Trek Picard focuses on a different era. JL Picard is old and retired from it's glory days on Star Fleet. He lives his days sipping on wine on his old Picard Chateau, frustated by Data's death on the aftermath of the Synthetic attack on Mars. Data, as it seems, gave is life for Picard, and he's been dead for 14 years.\nSynths, as Data, caused the death of thousands of human lifes on Mars and were forbidden since then, on the failed attempt of saving Romulus from it's fate.This is the premise of ST Picard.\nIn no way did I see \"the memory of Gene Roddenberry\" maculated in any way. So I don't understand why on Earth there are dozens of reviews classifying this with 1 star. Visually, this is an impecable achievement and although there are small flaws with the writing, in no way should this be classified with 1 star.\nActors do their job competently, storywise, I see no flaws, screenplay is done impeccably.\nCritics are clearly biased by God knows what, maybe by a personal idea of what Star Trek should be like (which in turn, follows a religion-like star trek assumption theory, that everyone seems to blindly follow). Among so much trash nowadays on TV, this should be cherished, not trashed.Now, don't get me wrong, this show isn't perfect.Patrick Stewart is aged and it's noticeable. But his frailty adds to the series, because we're used to see him as a powerful figure, the one who came back from the Borg. This is another plus you'll get from this series, you'll get to know more about the Borg and even learn that those who were long assimilated, are recoverable, at least in someway.\nThe show moves slowly, developing the characters and the story itself and I found myself actually caring about the characters, which is how it should be I guess.Star Trek Picard shouldn't be bashed the way it has been, it's extremely unfair. All those who gave it 1 star, think well why you did it... 1 star, really?\nUnbelieavable.\nWhat they're really saying is: \"you haven't followed the original formula, so in return, here's 1 star rating, because the original formula should be used ad nauseam...\".All things evolve, even Star Trek. And I think this one evolved the right way.\n8\/10 from me, just to contradict the other trekkies :)","rating":"8\/10","date":"21 June 2020"}
{"title":"Masterful, intelligent, poignant...and extremely well written","review":"You're not going to find massive interstellar battles in this series, or episodes with a story that starts and end in the episode (it's more a miniseries).The pace is slow and you don't have all that excitement of Star Trek TNG (anything else is garbage, in my book, sorry Trekkers).What you do get is very intelligent writing and a long storyline which wraps together so very nicely...and has some truly emotional moments. You see some of the old characters telling you how their story ends, and it's really touching.The series doesn't try to take Picard and present him as the younger, testosterone magnet of TNG. It takes Picard and show him under a much more vulnerable and wise and appropriate light for his age.I really tried to watch the other shows...e.g. The acclaimed Star Trek Strange New Worlds. But the utter stupidity and political correctness of those shows bothers me too much. Science, for example, has never been a true mainstay of Star Trek...but these other shows just spit it in the face.Thank you Patrick Stewart for giving us this and for getting it to Season 3. This is the only show that will properly connect and end TNG. Ignore the hate.","rating":"9\/10","date":"21 July 2022"}

{"title":"This is NOT Star Trek: The Next Generation seasons 8 and onwards","review":"Star Trek: Picard is \"Star Trek\", yet if you'd expect it to be the 8th and 9th season of ST:TNG, then you'd probably should put your Impulse Engines in reverse. \"Picard\" is not Starfleet-themed or about \"exploring strange new worlds and new civilizations\". There is (almost) no Enterprise (yet?). It is also a product of its time, it evolved. We are not living in the 1980's anymore.\"Picard\" is a series about what it tells you in the title: Star Trek's beloved Captain \/ Admiral: Jean-Luc Picard. You rejoin the life of Jean-Luc Picard, now retired, and whatever crosses his path. It is an ode to friendships, established over the former decades, camaraderie, and the wisdom that you acquire with the years passing. If you were\/are a real Star Trek: The Next Generation-fan, you will enjoy \"Star Trek: Picard\". It makes some subtle nods, but from a personal point of view: Picard's.Furthermore, the main protagonist is Patrick Stewart as 'Jean-Luc Picard', an octogenarian in real life playing an Admiral over 90 years old. (Picard was born in 2305, and the series is set in 2399) If you feel this in the pace of the series, this is (more than) normal. It however gives you the time to enjoy the stellar performances of the new cast and the surprise appearances of some well-known faces.For me, it was a show that warms the heart, and makes you think. My only regret is that it's only 3 seasons that are planned.","rating":"10\/10","date":"8 June 2022"}

{"title":"Not for the Cold War era.","review":"When Gene Roddenberry envisioned a utopian future where a galaxy of races would form a perfect union, he did so on the back of remembering WWII, the fall of the Iron Curtain, the space race, and everything that would symbolise the Cold War. He wanted something that would inspire hope and given the world leaders in the West from 1945-70 it was possible to half believe that one day it would be true.The 80s gave us a string of movies and a new generation; the first season and a half was still locked in Gene's mould, and Gene's lawyers blocked episodes, but eventually Berman came onboard, Riker got a beard and things got better.DS9 was definitely the darker, seedier side to the federation. Between the inner working of Quark's mind, the war with the Gamma quadrant, and let's not forget that Section 31 first rears its head here.Voyager it seemed was a return to the benevolent federation, but with an intrepid crew facing the worst and the best, (but mostly the worst), that the Delta quadrant could throw at them.I'm not touching Enterprise, and while I personally love Discovery, I can see where the big departures from the norm will have upset many.Picard though. I think they're completely on point here with what we may see in the future, especially given how much more dystopian the world is today. We see a man who has made a life from doing what is right by standing up for the oppressed, the minority, or the threatened, whether they be Federation or not. We see his word, his iron bond ripped from him when the Federation will no longer support his efforts to stage a mass evacuation and by gambling his career and reputation on his last throw of the dice he loses everything. A man once hailed as the greatest of captains has no standing with Starfleet anymore. The government to which he has given his best years are happy to see the back of him.I'm not going to sit here and write out a bunch of spoilers and neither am I going to say that everything has made me happy, it hasn't. But I feel like this is more like a believable human tale versus a utopian dream. I was at odds with things that have happened to old show members, and have felt chills, throat lumps and shed genuine tears at the acting during some reunions of characters. Like it or hate it, but this simply feels like a tale worthy of Star Trek for the twenty first century audience. I have heard from friends and family who didn't really like ST, but are loving Discovery and Picard, quite simply because it feels more real and not like a soap opera in space. Both shows certainly seem to be more realistically human in nature.","rating":"10\/10","date":"8 March 2020"}

I mean hey, it's Picard! I can't see this episode without remembering the multiple times I have seen all those TNG episodes, but I think even if you have never seen anything from Star Trek you can appreciate this (but you'll need to get used to the whole ST world then though ;) ).\nI for one am a happy camper an love it that one can anticipate for a week to see the next part of this chapter in mr.

{"title":"Ignore all the trash talk, it's a good show","review":"This is such a change of pace from the previously camp Techy-Trekkie outings and I like it!!!!I myself was an avid fan, and a child, of the Next Generation and thoroughly enjoyed it, at the time.....But I try to watch it now and find it very difficult and embarrassingly unbelievable and kitsch. It's not a criticism of the show in any way, I'm simply holding a mirror to what was once considered cutting edge Sci-Fi. There's no blame to be placed, the show was just a victim of its own time.So when a follow up show like Picard comes along, set far into the future from the original series and written with a contemporary pen it's such a breath of fresh air.It's great to see the old characters again (sadly not enough of them make an appearance for my liking though) in their new lives post serving on the Enterprise and so cleverly written into a thrilling story line.I appreciate the production values of Picard are very different to the old way of doing things within the Trekkie universe but in my opinion it's for the better. I get the feeling that this has been created for people just like me who were, in their youth, keen fans. It's as though the show has aged just as I have in terms of suitability. I'm now a grown up who likes to watch grown up TV\/film. There's even swearing now, AND I like it!!I'm not going to say anything else other than I think one should form opinions based on the entirety of a show and not just a handful of episodes. Judge for yourself, don't believe the majority of the trash reviews on here. I suspect they were written by ardent fans of the William Shattner era and his incarnation of what it is to be a Captain of the Enterprise. If I'm not mistaken, similar negative things were said about the Next Generation when it made it's debut yet it stood the test of time.

{"title":"This Star Trek, should take its meds and have a nice nap.","review":"Almost dropped this to a 4 rating. Series got off to a goodish start, but so far it isn't cohering well at all. It's still not clear Picard is the same guy we knew & not so much loved but were in awe of, the guy who in one of the films (I forget which one) could simply commandeer the entire remainder of the embattled star fleet This is Jean-Luc Picard. I am assuming command of the fleet. Concentrate all fire on the following co-ordinates...\" The question that this series poses in the first instance is: is Jean Luc Picard the old man, still the great captain, and as at episode 3 I'm inclined to say 'no, he isn't, and this series isn't real Star TrekNo doubt some of this is a generational thing. Brought up on the Next Generation is to have seen Star Trek at its best, where everything was about the story. Values were in there too, & were typically the centre of each episode: a moral fable wrapped in an enigma. Each episode would begin with us wondering what on earth was going on. The solutions were often genuinely provoking.The solutions were also often brilliants treatments of social issues, current or anticipated & though they tended to be liberal, they were never in your face. This series is different. There is a little mystery, although it is far from compelling. There are no social issues, or knotty dilemmas, with the exception of the legacy dilemma that forms the backdrop of Picard's retirement: should we risk our own lives to rescue our enemies. Beyond that, there is little recognizably Star Trek about this series and little remaining of Captain Picard, although of course no doubt the intention will be to return him to the helm.Returning to the matter of 'social issues' instead of exploring social justice issues as TNG might have done, instead what we have is massive representation of women in command positions. There are some programs where this works. This is one where it seems unnatural and forced. It doesn't help that none of them are obviously interesting. The main female protagonist, the sister, isn't bad, but the whole secret identity with enormous powers to be revealed seems like a re-tread of every other movie in the last two decades. On the subject of females, the glorious Jeri Ryan appears to be in the cast list, so there is that to look forward to.On the subject of representation, the action, such as it is, suffers greatly from this wokeness. The main girl has an excuse to be able to fight well. Not so the Romulan housekeeper or whatever she is. SPOILER - when down the line a crack squad of elite special forces killers from an ancient order of ....oh whatever....and get picked off one at a time by Terry & June (obscure British telly reference) & Picard throwing his false teeth at them it's hard to maintain interest.Why do producers do this. Are we really going to habituate to this nonsense? Will this eventually be normal because we've seen it so many times. I guess it probably already is normal if you were born this century. But it's just sad.As for the settings, they should be really interesting. Futuristic cityscapes should transport us into an imagined future, and have us imagining we were there, but it all seems trite. As for the real candy, (minor spoiler) the captured Borg ship, this should be a dream scenario. So far though there is little to engage us. I anticipate it will get a bit better as things get going, but so far the set up doesn't leave us much hope in that area. Bottom line is it's lacklustre","rating":"1\/10","date":"9 February 2020"}

I also like how each episode is done as chapters and contains a larger serialized arc for the storyline and individual episodes. However I do like both individual episodes in series arcs, and Star Trek Picard has both. Captain Vatic is one of the most interesting antagonists that I've ever seen.

The background of this incident is slowly uncovered in subsequent episodes, but there is enough quality special effects and good acting to keep you interested. The emergence of actors from previous trek series is a bonus.It seems there may be an organized campaign to discourage people from watching this series. Many of the 1-star reviews use the same phrases and buzzwords to criticize it. Give it a chance.","rating":"9\/10","date":"2 September 2022"}
{"title":"Season 3 finaly feels like TNG","review":"Why did we , the fans had to suffer through S1 and S2 ?Couldn't they just started with the competent writing we got in S3?The direction, story, motivation, chars , the dynamic, the dialogue and the acting with decision making, is finally starting to resemble Star Trek. No more visual pollution of 100vs100 ships nonsense, no more stupid drama written just because reasons, no more decision making of a 12 year brat dialogue\/chars, no more crocodile tears - just trying to be true to your humanity while solving the issues.Just so we're clear, I don't have an issue with S1 and S2 actors but the context , char motivations , the dialogue were absolutely terrible, the material they had to work was terrible.After watching 4 episodes I'm cautious optimistic (it still has some things I don't like like, for instance the lighting on the Federation ships is dark like u got to a Darth Vader workplace - I can't imagine waking up everyday excited to work in that light, or expecting aliens running with a bucket with them in space, or having a pump up laser shotgun - but those are nitpicks).Season 3 it feels like the TNG movie we never got, hope it doesn't flop; I'm just cautiously optimistic.","rating":"8\/10","date":"10 March 2023"}

{"title":"Open your mind ,don't think feel","review":"Those who open their mind will respect and like Picard! If anyone knew Gene he always pushed the envelope of perceptions and what the future should be. No poverty,pain,war or bias , that's exactly what Picard does.

{"title":"Star Trek playing its trump card: actor recognition. Encouragingly gynocentric","review":"First couple of episodes I thought, \"Wow! There's many a good tune played by a 79-year-old Shakespeare wallah. And Jeri Ryan is even hotter than she was in 19something!\" But I lost interest. It's too predictable.Although it's funny, nostalgic, epic-ish, and has a good balance of CGI and bokeh-focus, Picard relies too heavily on you, the consumer, accepting familiar tropes and knowing the backstory (and a smattering of Romulan), in order to care about what happens. The story is utterly predictable, because this is a pantomime. A sincere, dame-dominated pantomime, but nothing more interesting than that. The 'borg' plotline was done to death years ago, and one eye-extraction scene is quite enough - they show it twice.What's telling is that El-Nor (?), a new character who's a kind of sex-on-legs teenage mutant invincible matrix ninja, has NOTHING TO DO except when he's saving Picard's life, because that's all he's there for - Patrick Stewart can sadly no longer get away with stage combat. And it has to be said, his voice is going.It's like watching a veteran travelling acting troupe whose best days are behind them. The up-and-coming new people have no future and they know it.Still better than Star Wars, because it has grown-up jokes and better music. And Jeri Ryan.","rating":"5\/10","date":"29 March 2020"}
{"title":"So engaging!","review":"I grew up and was a big fan of Star Trek TNG. This show quickly got off to an exciting start and has continued to be incredibly engaging and fun! I love the story, actors, production design and direction. I enjoy the surprise visits from former cast and none feel forced, and sometimes authentically emotional. I'm writing this review because I logged in here to look up actor info and saw a number of especially bad reviews that came as a big surprise. I don't want them to change a thing!

[Wasn't TV entertainment stopped in this century?] ;)By the end of it I was hungry for more!But it's like a begnning of a very long movie or episode, so you cannot really tell if it's going to be good or bad at this moment, so therefor I give it an 8. I'd give it a 7.5 if that was possible, but it isn't on IMDB.It does NOT suck however, in ANY way of from, like so many sources on YOUTUBE etc have said =)AND it does NOT feel like neither The Next Generation nor Discovery (thank God), but a show completely standing on it's own!Do I recommend it? Well, yes, but it's really difficult to say after just one episode. It doesn't exactly hit you over the head with great scifi plot... yet? :)But as I said, I AM hungry for more, so I guess that is a positive sign.","rating":"8\/10","date":"23 January 2020"}

{"title":"Not a Star Trek fan...","review":"Despite my favorite genre is Sci-Fi, I never was a big Star Trek or Star Wars fan. When I was young I was more a book reader and I saw the original series distractedly and couldn't watch at all stuffs like deep space 9: too nerdy.\nI liked more series like BSG or SG or ST movies.\nI never saw Next generation but I have to say that Discovery and Picard, leveraging on the Star Trek world, also if it's possible that the ST fans don't like it, are for sure high quality produced and well written series. And you don't need to have watched old Star Trek Series to understand or appreciate them.\nI've watched some of first episodes of Next Generation now and Patrick Stewart seemed old already then, more than 30 years ago, and now is 80!!! and perhaps also a better actor.\nThat's incredible for any man to perform like that at that age and the series would be worth to be seen only because that, without mentioning the fact that the age of Picard itself have a strong and inspiring (yes!) meaning itself: it's never too late and you're never too old to repair your mistakes and change the world.","rating":"9\/10","date":"13 February 2020"}

{"title":"Not Star Trek, poorly written and woke, Picard is mostly passive in his own show.","review":"Picard is a shadow of a man that always seems to defer to the much smarter women.

The women keep lecturing and correcting the men even.As someone else said, this is like Discovery without the main hero and constant self-congradulations.","rating":"2\/10","date":"18 March 2022"}
{"title":"Perfect Start for Picard","review":"Finally they managed to produce a worthy new Star Trek Series. Discovery for me was a total fail, even if Season 2 was much better than Season 1 - but the first 10 Minutes of Episode 1 of Picard is better than the whole first DSC Season. Now lets hope, that they will keep up the flow and don\u00b4t start to mess it up with stupid nonsense like the did in Discovery! I really liked everything about it and it brought back old TNG memories. I must admit - i wasn\u00b4t expecting that but now i am very satisfied :)","rating":"10\/10","date":"25 January 2020"}
{"title":"Not even close","review":"Based off TNG seriously? I'm guessing those who made this tripe never really watched all 7 seasons of TNG because there is nothing vaguely familiar between this and TNG. And since when do Androids age and put on weight? That opening scene was terrible and 4 episodes in very little has happened. I remember when each Episode of TNG had a reason and a moral lesson but now it seems they are trying to turn it into a long and drawn out feature film. It just doesn't work. Face it, when Gene died so did any semblance of the Star Trek we know and loved.This is so painful to watch. If you are new to Star Trek try watching The Next Generation first then watch this. It's an insult to Star Trek to credit this as based on TNG because it just isn't.","rating":"2\/10","date":"14 February 2020"}

{"title":"A darker Star Trek","review":"I was never really a Star Trek fan but maybe that is why I actually really like this series.\nThe original Star Trek series were very light, full of constant hope for the future of human kind up to the point it seemed unrealistic to me. But I understand why so many people liked, it is nice to have a series that tries to give hope.\nThis series is much darker, many of the characters seem more real to me, though as they have their flaws. System of Starfleet is not as incorruptible as it appeared before. There is more cruelty in the universe, more crime etc. (especially episode 5) And yet, as the story unfolds, there is a hope in the darkness. But you have to wait for it and suffer a bit along with the characters.\nAll in all, the series seems much darker, yet still presenting hope in the end, which seems more realistic to me. Looking forward to season 2.","rating":"10\/10","date":"27 March 2020"}
{"title":"People seem to think it's supposed to be 1987 again *SPOILERS*","review":"I had to somehow find a way to login to an account I made as a kid because I have always been a movie buff. I always was an actor at heart, and yes. A Trekkie first and foremost. I've never been the type of guy to get the toys like some adults do. It's just not my bag. That's not the kind of person I am. But me and my brothers grew up watching nothing but Star Trek. It was a family thing. We didn't sit at the dinner table like your normal American family. We sat down and watched reruns of the next generation. Current episodes of deep space nine. New episodes of voyager back in my day. The last season of TNG was airing when I was born in July of '93. But before I could even speak I was watching Star Trek. Constantly. I found the remake of '09 to be quite good but different. And I remember my first bits of difficulty with the franchise while watching Enterprise. It wasn't my cup of tea. Neither was Star Trek five. Into darkness was great until I saw it with a date as I facepalmed during the finale. I tried not to be such a nerd. But she started to notice I was literally announcing the lines to a movie I've never seen before that day. It's because it straight up ripped off Wrath of Khan. And I have been wary of Trek ever since. I can see how some people have woes about Discovery, but I don't get it with this show. I read nothing but terrible reviews on here. And it's beginning to worry me. This show is nothing but good. People need to realize this isn't Star Trek from 33 years ago. Picard isn't the same. You're not the same. The set pieces are brilliant. The dialogue is more than fine and the cameos and appearances do nothing but fill me with joy as a fan of Trek. There's no way a show can ruin a show from 33 years ago. Grow up and just enjoy the time Trek has left. The show runners aren't burying it. You are.","rating":"9\/10","date":"7 February 2020"}

But it's about a retired Picard, you should expect it to be slower. Though the action scenes are ACTION SCENES in many cases.It's very story-based and and probably cannot hold people's attention as well in today's \"cut to a new camera shot every 3 seconds because we'll assume everyone has ADHD world.\" It's more like an adventure that goes into space in the Start Trek Universe and happens to have Star Trek characters from Next Generation and Voyager.

{"title":"So far unimpressive","review":"I have watched all four episodes which have been released so far. Can we please get on with the story? This Star Trek universe is dark and dystopian, which is OK with me but I am really upset with the plot points that lead no where, the constant waiting for something to happen, the long shots with almost no dialogue and the pointless backstory on minor characters. OK, Jean-Luc tried to save the Romulans from a supernova which would result in their extinction. There were those in Star Fleet who thought this was not the best idea but reluctantly gave assent. Then, things went sideways and Jean-Luc resigned and retired to his chateau and vineyards in France. A mysterious girl walks into his life. She is a synthetic human, an android, a replicant, if you will, who is unaware of her own origin. She is destroyed and now Picard and a surly, hired Captain and a cynical former Star Fleet officer who served under Picard and calls him, \"JL\" and a naive scientist are off to find the android's \"twin sister\" before she is destroyed too. Why? Because the Romulans hate androids. Why? Because of some obscure Romulan myth? Maybe. Or maybe there is a larger plot to destroy the Federation and Star Fleet or to bring the Borg back or to breed Tribbles, or to distill Saurian brandy. Who knows? Every plot point is ultimately a McGuffin. Every Romulan acts like a human. Every Star Fleet officer acts like an idiot. The only one who is the least bit decisive is Picard and even he does not really know why or where he is going or doing despite having four episodes to make up his mind. And don't get me started on the lens flares or the really poor acting and dialogue. I had hope for this series, but alas, my hopes were misplaced. I will finish out the first season only to see if the writers actually do have an ending to this, but it appears that the scripts were written by the Ferengi, who only are interested in profit,","rating":"2\/10","date":"19 February 2020"}

It doesnt look like Star Trek, it doesnt sound like Star Trek and it doesnt feel like Star Trek, so it isnt Star Trek! I loved TNG, DS9, Voyager and most of Enterprise...but just like ST Discovery, ST Picard simply isnt Star Trek. It is woke agenda pushing, poorly written, in cohesive soap style garbage in a sci fi theme with the Star Trek logo put onto it. Jean Luc is a big push over and shouted and pounded at by EVERY female character in the series (men are bad okay!!). His legacy is gone and is actively being crushed! A trailer trash hippy calls him JL, an all female powered Star Fleet spit in his face and scenes dedicated in showing the fact that people do not know one of the biggest legacy captains the Star Trek universe has ever seen...only a couple of years earlier within the time line! In gods name...why? Why call a series Star Trek Picard and then both crap on Star Trek...and Picard.There is simply too much wrong to mention here but as a life long Star Trek fan I feel highly disappointed. If you like a quick rush, shallow, sci fi themed soap opera, then this series is for you. If you are looking to once again feel like watching a Star Trek series like you use to (OST, TNG, DS9, Voyager, Enterpise), then stay miles away from this nonsense as it will only frustrate and disappoint you.I say it again, shame on everyone involved!","rating":"1\/10","date":"9 February 2020"}

{"title":"no spoilers opinion","review":"Star trek, unlike Star Wars, has always re-invented itself; perhaps this is why so many people have posted poor reviews of this different but excellent series. This is not a comfortable revisiting of an old friend. Picard is frail and no-longer potent within Starfleetl; the federation is not as saintly as we all thought and it takes a little while for the writers to point that out. One star or two star reviews would seemt to show that developing a story is no longer acceptable to some. We live in a culture of immediacy: I want it and I want it now! Well, you're going to have to wait until the third episode before this series truly takes off, and this, clearly, is too long a wait for a lot of people. This series takes its time to tell its story, and yes it has more false ends than The Lord of the Rings, but it is still wonderful, joyously cast; and very much a Star Trek series.

Patrick Stewart is playing his age here. He's fragile, sensitive and old. He knows it and the writers know it. I feel sorry for ANYONE that doesn't \"get it\". I also think most of these reviews are by trolls who are just here to say mean spirited comments for the purpose of inciting anger on our behalf. Tv doesn't get any better people! This is it!

Thus, they could use any show at all to carry their trendy message. So they watched clips of Star Trek on YouTube as 'research', and wrote a lazy, preachy drama about an apology-tour by an old man. To try and hoodwink the rubes (that's us), they sprinkle in old faces - despite swearing before the show premiered they would not do that. (Lying? No, foolish peon, this is 'reprioritizing the narrative,'). Remember when it was going to be a character-driven show? No space battles, no gratuitous murders? That lasted what, 15 minutes into the first episode? The Hand of Kutzman has woven straw into... excremental. Again. Forget it. In five years, this will have sunk without a trace.

So much nostalgia if your an old fan but for new fans this just comes out swinging its like a looking glass into what we become how we grow and how things evolve. Some of the lines had me breaking up like the dream sequence, one of the only dream sequences in tv I actually enjoyed.Man if this show keeps as good as the first episode you will have a trekie right here.Discovery was okay but I found myself annoyed with the lead sometimes and her ignorance of everything around her, this seems like its going to be more real.","rating":"10\/10","date":"24 January 2020"}

Whining about having lesbians in a series about a modern future for example, it's just sad.So don't listen, this Series is really good from the start.

They changed the world, and I don't really care what they do...I am simply thrilled to see them. Patrick Stewart is 81yrs old.

{"title":"Unpopular opinion","review":"First of all, I am not a Star Trek fan so I would not be able to compare. I see that I am one of the few or even the one that really liked this series. I was looking for a movie or a series that is engaged in space and at the same time looks good and has a message to it. I was really surprised by this one. I like Patrick Stewart and I think he really makes something of the series. Anyways, I recommend this one for people looking for good sci fi and a good storyline.","rating":"9\/10","date":"13 March 2020"}

Those who are disappointed now had wrong expectations. It doesn't make sense to compare Star Trek Picard with Discovery. Conclusion after the third episode: ST Picard is told in a dense and exciting way, a good mix of character moments, action and secrecy with an extremely satisfying climax as the end of the episode, but it is definitely even better. Now it's time to get started and not lose the thread! Not a bad third episode. FINALLY in space at the end...now we're off to another world that's not a flashback to Mars.the great strength of this \"Picard\" show is that it understands that what made the Picard character so great and loved was his strong moral conviction and sense of duty, loyalty and honor.

{"title":"Truly excellent. Disheartening, but realistic.","review":"Star Trek always held out such an idealistic hope that some combination of advancements in time and technology would result in fundamental changes to human nature. That our blind and irrational hatred would evaporate, to be replaced by morality and utilitarian ethics. The writing for this series throws that all away, and is much more honest with the viewer. It presents a futuristic world in which people behave as they've always behaved, and history continues to repeat itself.. after having been all too quickly forgotten. On the one hand, this approach is heart breaking.. because it shatters the overly optimistic (but false) illusion that we can be better. On the other hand, the quality of the production is superb.. in every aspect. There is a lot of potential for this series to take a fresh (albeit more cynical) look at the Star Trek universe.","rating":"9\/10","date":"23 December 2021"}

It brings back Picard and throws him into a new adventure, setting the scene for what will hopefully be a few more seasons of fun.Sure, I get a some of the critique, I don't always like the choices the writers made, some of the new characters feel a bit forced and I have a feeling the writers tried a bit too hard to make this a '2020 show'. However, that doesn't take away the beauty of some of the parts and the message it conveys. Faith in people and not giving into fear are very important messages in today's world and I think this season addresses them nicely. It's also great to see some of my old favorites back in action and I feel the writers did them justice . I thoroughly enjoyed the first season and can't wait for the next season. I'm very interested to see where they take this.","rating":"8\/10","date":"9 September 2020"}
{"title":"Quite possibly THE best Trek I've ever seen","review":"This show is everything we wanted in a Star Trek series, unlike Discovery which is just millennial whinging!I just finished season 3 and I have to say that was the best Trek I've ever seen! Brining most of the Next Generation cast back was utterly brilliant. Nostalgic but also excellent writing and not a hint of cheesiness. I honestly cannot get over how good it was. I wish Sir Patrick Stewart was up for another series, but even if he isn't, his son Jack is definitely the guy to start a new generation of amazing Trek with hopefully Seven of Nine as his captain. Honestly going to watch it all again and do so over and over. Outstanding TV. Outstanding Trek.","rating":"10\/10","date":"15 January 2022"}
{"title":"Well worth a look","review":"Don't understand all the negative reviews for this new Star Trek series on Amazon Prime. Watched all ten episodes.The story line about fear of synthetic lifeforms is very prescient and the acting from Patrick Stewart et al is excellent. I particularly liked Santiago Cabrera as Captain 'I'm not a cat person' Rios. I knocked of a star for unnecessary use of profanities which shouldn't be coming out of Star Fleet admirals and the love scenes were a bit unconvincing. How can you make love wearing your undergarments ? Still American TV, although comfortable with gratuitous violence, has always been coy about nudity on prime time shows - pun intended.

Bore off.This isn't the same because you are probably pushing 40 or older and its not the mid 90s. Grow up FFSThis is a mature high brow take on Star Trek and a continuation of the Picard story that is executed perfectly. Serious drama spattered with just enough action to keep it fun, references to the old series and what came after and a few well placed cameos make this a brilliant entry into the star trek universe. The new characters are welcomed additions too.I'm sure you are reading this and its making your blood boil as you disagree whole heartedly and there is not a single thing you can do about it.

It's got the same characters sure, but tells a new story.This show is new, but doesn't tread on the old.

Another interesting thing I found was dozens of duplicate entries all of them 9\/10. Someone is trying hard to make Picard look awesome, I get it people need work. The thing is, if you need to artificially pump up the ratings on a show then you know it's a howler, a show gone to the dogs.Mr Stuart is old and it distracts from his performance. So it looks like he wasn't acting like an old frail man in Logan, he was just being Patrick.Other reviews have pointed this out, but I also don't see balance, I see gynocentrism.

{"title":"Times are changing and so does Star Trek...","review":"...every new ST show deals with the same old problem that some fans say they do not recognize Star Trek anymore. DS9 is an popular example for it, and today its considered as the best of all Trek Shows by many fans. Picard is a new kind of Trek, we are not longer on a starfleed ship where everyone is at is best. The federation is still kicking and alive but it have changed, lost a bit of its soul. The tone of hat show is very different, because live beyond the federation is no utopia, its though and dangerous. For some it is even hopeless, basically all of our new characters are somehow hopeless, broken, vulnerable and complex. This is something very new to this utopian Star Trek world. But there is no light without darkness, and ST:P shows this darkness in all its details. But there is also hope, because all this characters are on the edge to a healing process, and this process started with Picards mission. And I doubt they are still broken and lost when this mission is over. If you miss the old Star Trek, watch the old Star Trek. Ist nothing wrong with that, I still love this shows dearly. But I\u00c2\u00b4m also excited about the evolution of Star Trek with all those new ideas, they are do not just produce rip-offs. But they also honor the old Trek shows I grow up with. And I do not understand why people are saying the writing is bad, in my eyes its excellent, clever and they do not spoonfeed the audience like usuall. Its like reading a book, from time to time you will need your imagination and your brain. So the show goes literally boldly where no Trek Show went before....","rating":"9\/10","date":"29 February 2020"}

{"title":"The final nail in the coffin of Star Trek","review":"I loved Star Trek all throughout my childhood and into my adult life. TNG, Voyager, DS9, TOS, Enterprise, and all of the movies up to and including Nemesis. But I made a bitter realisation around 10 years ago, after going to my first Star Trek convention. The magic, optimism and joy all Star Trek fans understand and enjoy, had been quietly replaced behind the scenes. Don't get me wrong, I know that money needs to be made and actors grow tired of their roles. But I started to realise that fans of Star Trek were seen as foolish cash cows by the franchise owners, and mindless morons by the actors (not all, though).When the JJ films landed I was disappointed but I enjoyed them for what they were. As long as I told myself they weren't really Star Trek, I could accept them. Discovery, a politically driven and unapologetic lip service to woke ideological nonsense was both insulting and disturbing. But fortunately, felt so far removed from Star Trek that it almost went by unnoticed. There were at least characters I liked and moments I enjoyed.Now this...There is nothing positive to take from STP. The writing is both aweful and politically motivated. If I thought Discovery was driven by woke agendas then Picard just took it to a whole new level. The acting is appalling, especially by Patrick Stewart. The fictional science is unbelievably dire. It's cheap and crass (the swearing is vile). People don't watch star trek to be lectured by over paid fools with no grasp on reality. The entire series seems determined to dismantled a great male icon (I point out the male part since women seem to be the ones constantly attacking him). Patrick Stewart is a disgrace for taking on this role again and allowing the legacy of Picard to be mutilated. He certainly has no place in the hearts of true Trek fans any more. A sad end, indeed.","rating":"1\/10","date":"17 February 2020"}
{"title":"Engage!!","review":"I grew up with the next generation and I saw everything. Picard is so good. When he says engage at the end of the 3d episode I got goosebumps and all girly like and I am nearly 50. Go where no one has gone before Picard.","rating":"10\/10","date":"7 February 2020"}
{"title":"It doesn't need to be trek, but it still needs to be good. And it isnt.","review":"I get the idea, our world is falling apart and so we need a trek show that isn't as bluntly idealistic but one that is a bit colder, a bit crueler and in which Picard acts as like a Bernie Sanders in Space who remembers the values of old.That's fine.But the show doesn't deliver what similar shows like The Expanse, Galactica or Firefly gave us.The characters are flawed and broken, which is fine, but they are also bland, depressing, lifeless, joyless and just very very Dark And Brooding.This show has no moments of light to balance out its Dark And Grittiness.The show also has a Big Mystery in the spirit of Lost and I am not really hopeful The Mystery will be solved in a compelling way.This show is best avoided.","rating":"2\/10","date":"23 February 2020"}
{"title":"Outstanding - Does not disappoint.","review":"A wonderful continuation of Picard's storyline taking place 20 years or so after the events of Nemesis. Haunted by Data's death and still angry at Starfleet for banning all synthetic life, Picard maintains an unfulfilling life at his family chateau in France. When a young woman comes to him for help, Picard is drawn into a mission which reopens old wounds from his assimilation by the Borg, uncovers centuries- old Romulan plots and sets him on a course for a new destiny which will reunite him with old friends, new enemies and a rediscovery of himself.This is a very different kind of Trek and a very welcome change of pace. While this does feature the same kind of action and cinematic feel as Discovery, it is also beautiful, contemplative and slow burning. The supporting cast are wonderful and intriguing in equal measure. Star Trek Picard also ties together elements from all previous incarnations of the franchise while expanding the universe in a whole new direction.It did not disappoint and I'm eager for season 2.","rating":"10\/10","date":"12 April 2020"}

{"title":"Wow! What a ride! Can't wait until series 2 comes out.","review":"I cannot believe the amount of drongoes who have panned this. I can only assume these are the same haters that have regularly panned every episode of ST:D.\nI have had to wait until ST:P came out on Blu Ray because I refused to subscribe to Amazon, having already subscribed to Netflix. But it was well worth the wait in my opinion.\nSo what do I think?\nFirst off, it was cleverly written. For those who didn't like the way that Star Fleet has descended into dystopia, I say why not? It would be unrealistic to assume that everything is always sweetness and light with Star Fleet. The system is far from perfect.\nAfter reading the first ST:P novel, subject matter being the evacuation of Romulus, it is easy to understand the events that unfolded in the first episode of the series. From then on, it was quite a wild ride. I liked the appearances of Data, Hugh, Seven, Troi and Riker. It was clever that they weren't just dropped in to garner fan interest, but rather were a vital addition to the story.I am wondering what it was the haters were expecting. I think the days of self contained episodes in a series are long gone.I found ST:P more of a mystery. Picard and crew searching for the answers to many questions. Quite intriguing.The final twist was very surprising and completely unexpected.All in all, I loved the series, but I do have some criticisms. Possibly these have already been pointed out by other critics, but here goes:Firstly, way too much talking and not nearly enough action.\nSecondly, and more importantly, will someone please tell the cast to stop whispering. This was a major critic of ST:D. I hate watching a programme where I have to constantly reach for the remote control to turn the volume up and down because one minute I can't hear what's being said and the next my ears are almost blown by a passing starship.Having said all of this, I'll be excited what happens in series 2.","rating":"10\/10","date":"13 February 2021"}

{"title":"I never review things, but this time I just had to.","review":"Honestly, how can any new Trek actually be called \"Star Trek\"? When it comes to series like Picard and Discovery, they have \"updated\" it so much, that the things which made it special and unique have been erased. I am actually quite surprised that actors and actresses who featured in some of the traditional Trek series and movies, do not have a problem with the evolution of the series under the new regime.I have watched all of season one of Picard, and it's hard to stomach. It's a little bit like any new Science Fiction series of our time. There's not really much we can say except: \"Well, at least the CGI was awesome.\" I find it difficult to watch TNG and Voyager now, as some of my favourite characters from those series have been sullied and re-written in a distopian and depressing future. The whole point of Gene Roddenberry's Start Trek universe was that humanity was going to end up in a better place than they are now. Picard portrays humanity as a race of regression. Why? Who knows. To make it more relatable and edgy? Perhaps. It wouldn't be so bad if it weren't being produced as \"Star Trek\", but rather a spin off of some kind.I appreciate that a lot of hard work has been put into these series, but if the new producers and directors aren't up to the challenge of creating a shows which honour the previous shows; then there's literally no point in making them at all. Star Trek has history and requires very precis continuity. It's not just something which can be inferred or assumed to be accurate on a case by case basis. Every episode mocks the history of the hundreds of episodes and dozens of feature films which came before it. Peace and optimism has been replaced by gory violence and playing on whatever social justice topic is \"on tend\" this week. Star Trek was always able to stay topical to its time without being obvious and exhausting.","rating":"1\/10","date":"28 March 2020"}

You're like a minute in and your mind already shut off after 20 seconds\".This was written by another reviewer, and sums up most of what is to be expected in today's 'next generation'. In the current age of digital technology, it's sad to notice that some people have the attention span of a goldfish. Short attention span is not an incurable disease. With patience and practice, you can master any skill. All you need to do is avoid addiction to mobile devices. Live an unplugged life whenever you can. Staying single-tasking may help you sharpen your focusing skills.Picard, ok, it's a little slow, but it's nowhere near as bad as some people on here make it out to be. Giving this show 1 star?

What gave this series promise was continuing the conversation around Data being a sentient being that dominated the first few TNG series but if you look back to those episodes it's almost taken for granted that he is and therefore the viewer also takes it for granted but it was really a massive thing! Therefore I'm glad that this seems to be the focus of this new series and I hope that future episodes slow down to reflect on what it is to be a sentient being - what it is to be alive and this is the best of Trek when they stop to consider these things rather than massive CGI space battles - peoples' imaginations are far more powerful than pixels put together on film and made the focus of the plot. Well done - cannot wait for next Friday!.","rating":"9\/10","date":"25 January 2020"}
{"title":"I agree with most reviewers here...this is not star trek quality","review":"Star Trek was innovative but this series is anything but. There is very little character development, disjointed scenes, Las Vegas type planets, I mean really can't we do better...it's depressing to think that so far in the future that nothing has changed. Picard is not acting like the staunch retired admiral that you would expect, he's portrayed as a caricature in a bad play. In one episode, the doctor who is supposed to be a \"top notch specialist\" on synthetic life is afraid of a hologram and acts like an overly emotional kid. Anyway, I really hope that producers and writers read these reviews and why does this series have 8.2 as a rating when review after review is below 5...mmmm","rating":"2\/10","date":"21 February 2020"}
{"title":"Great show but way too short","review":"I'm tired of these companies making really great shows but making them way too short either in season or episode time frame. TV series now seem like 30 min short stories or if they are 45 min to 1 hour long then they only have 8 to 10 episodes for a entire season. I love alot of these shows but they are easily forgotten since they dont have enough air time. I would of given 10 stars for this if CBS would have the episodes longer and more to a season. The same goes for Star Trek Discovery. It seems as if TV is dying off.","rating":"8\/10","date":"5 February 2020"}
{"title":"I don't mind the tonal shift, but...","review":"Even if we experienced the ST:NG timeframe as a pretty peaceful and positive phase, history tells us that that can change over a few years. So, I don't mind that this series is more violent. And I am a big fan of ST8, which was, after all, an action flick.\nBut, this one is boring. Sooo boring.\nAt least the first five episodes. And with all the options today, I'm not willing to wait for it to get better.\nGoodbye, Jean-Luc.","rating":"5\/10","date":"23 February 2020"}
{"title":"Such stuff as dreams are made on!","review":"I enjoyed this series very much. I am rather surprised at some of these negative reviews, since this show seemed entirely written in the great Star Trek tradition to me, which one I grew up with. Picard himself displayed the same traits he always did in TNG: a mixture of hubris, gravitas and inspirational yet democratic leadership.The assembled crew quickly establish themselves as a varied one in the Trek tradition and the adversaries are nicely done, particularly as the viewer suspects that they might actually be in the right..!Best of all, this series with all its nods to previous locations, art styles and planet-hopping narratives takes us forward in the Trek universe, showing us how their technology develops.Well done!","rating":"10\/10","date":"29 August 2020"}
{"title":"Good show - just approach it from a different angle","review":"I will admit I quit after the first couple of episodes...but revisited it. Give it a chance....as a show with a Star Trek base. It is quite different from other Star Trek series but the characters grow on you and the references to the past are great. It's nice to see Jeri Ryan again....and Riker & Troi. Is Picard not the old Picard - ha ! Exactly, he is the old Picard. He's a bit slower in speech, not quite as confident...goodness, Patrick Stewart is almost 80 when this was filmed, so is Picard. The premise is solid. It develops nicely.","rating":"8\/10","date":"15 June 2020"}
{"title":"Star Trek lives... A Promise Was Kept","review":"First I absolutely hate discovery... I was angered thinking I would never have an opportunity to see a new Star Trek in my lifetime. But then I saw one day Patrick Stewart on stage giving a talk and he gave his word that he would bring back Star Trek. Without a doubt he kept his word perfectly.If you like sci-fi in particular Star Trek then be overjoyed because I believe this is the last chance to see heritage and character brought back to the screen. Partially because the next generation cast is here. Come on we love them so much Star Trek the next generation was the number one rated show in television history and they brought us adventures to remember forever.Star Trek Picard season one though being different and modern actually maintained some of its roots and once again this was promised. There were moments my heart was singing because the past and present meets quite well in this new story for its first season. I'm glad I that I am here to witness this and to see a sci-fi adventure not spoiled and ruined with social situations that are totally corrupted as Star Trek discovery chose to go down.If you thought you may be skeptical watch the series 1st season again go ahead watch it for a second time you will get more out of it and you will get more passionate I'm positive because that's what happened to me. The first time around your little in disarray watch it again and it just comes to life jumps off the screen and pulls you into it. Obviously I'm so happy and I think you will be as wellIf you've made it this far thanks for considering to read my review.","rating":"9\/10","date":"5 May 2021"}
{"title":"Heartwarming any time to see the old crew","review":"Like many I grew up watching Star Trek the original series and The Next Generation starring Patrick Stewart. The series was always about exploring the ideals of human kind i.e. Morality, friendship, courage, overcoming differences, and also exploring its vulnerabilities. And achieved it marvelously over a large canvas of fantastic imagination. As a child it inspired us to think beyond and be fascinated. For which I always loved the series. So its heartwarming to see Patrick Steward reprising the role of captain again, and also some of the old crew members that I loved watching as a child. Brings back lovely memories. Sentient inorganic beings was always a core theme of the series, and it takes the center stage in Picard as well. I enjoyed watching Picard. We need more of Star Trek, hope it inspires next generation of kids, to think beyond differences, towards collective potential. And hope to see the franchise live long and prosper :-)","rating":"9\/10","date":"28 May 2021"}
{"title":"Missing the Star and Trek out of Star Trek","review":"Normally I don't do reviews, but after the 5th episode I have to do it.\nFirst of all if you want Star Trek, the positive utopian world where humanity hopes are in the stars and it gives you an escape from reality, an inspiration for a new generation of young scientists, you are dead wrong here. It's depressive, dark and dead wrong for this franchise. And I loved Deep Space 9, that had dark and grim moments.There is only minimal good sci-fi in there. Instead what you get is lot of character talking about their feelings and losses and failures in life. It's depressive and seriously don't watch it if you are down in life!\nOld characters are all over the place and they had a personality wipe from the Kurtzman team. They don't behave as they did in the old series, movies. As usual all men are miserable, bad, or weak, while all the women have the power and strength and \"badassery\". Another stab to Gene Roddenberry's future equality. The dialogues are closer to CW DC cheesy series and some of those are sometimes actually enjoyable. It's very boring.Also it's full of tropes of mystical things and mcguffins, \"the chosen one\", searching for the big \"truth\" trash stuff, that was done to death. It's your typical mystery box, from the creator of the new Mummy movie that flopped. It wont advance your critical thinking as the older Trek series did.\nWhile they say it's in the \"prime timeline\" of Star Trek it's not the canon Star Trek. It's a bastardized mix of the old and the \"Kelvin timeline\". Beside everyone swearing and poverty suddenly again a thing on Earth you can see that by the warp effect, that is clearly from the Kelvin timeline movies. Federation suddenly don't want to help a species, because they fear them, while Kirk himself who lost his son, killed by a Klingon, still managed to make peace with them, but this Federation can't do the same with the Romulans.\nThere is not much traveling between stars and even when they finally gone to somewhere else, to another planet, it's again just to talk there about their feelings, not to show interesting and unusual world in a scientific way, making your mind work.So all-in-all if you want to be depressive, sour and hopeless, ending up lacking the mental power to wake up the next morning to make the world better, I can recommend Star Trek: Misery, Picard edition.If you want something opposite, watch The Orville. Also you want to see good gritty sci-fi with good, strong characters, watch The Expanse.","rating":"1\/10","date":"24 February 2020"}
{"title":"Great sci-fi","review":"There's a lot of sci-fi out there that is just plain bad and boring, this one is really good and doesn't dumb it down for the npc's out there.

{"title":"AfterMASH Redux","review":"To be fair, they did warn us that this show wasn't going to be anything like ST: TNG and they were right.The problem is they're using a ST icon (Jean-Luc Picard) in order to lure people into watching it and as bad as the show is I'm a huge fan of ST: TNG and Capt. Picard so out of a sense of I loyalty I'm watching it but I'm resenting it.I can't stand Dr. Jurati and can that Raffi person PLEASE stop calling Jean-Luc Picard \"JL\"?? It's disrespectful and it doesn't fit his character, he's not a mechanic he's a former starfleet Admiral. It just doesn't sound right, it's grating.There is so much wrong with this show - bad cast, weak Picard (he's constantly talked down to by women which is annoying too), boring, corrupt Starfleet (really bothers me) and on it goes.This show ripped the very soul out of Star Trek and all that it stood for. Why does Kurtzman have the keys to the cadillac? He clearly doesn't understand Star Trek. It's sad.","rating":"4\/10","date":"21 March 2020"}
{"title":"Reviewers need to calm down, and maybe rewatch the Trek they compare this to.","review":"People seem to be writing reviews with really thick nostalgia goggles on. The number of 1 star reviews is absurd. This show is, at it's worse, still better than the average TNG first season episode. I found it well made and entertaining, liked the new characters, and, at the end of the day, Jean-Luc Picard is just a character I find it comforting and enjoyable to spend time with. Maybe this series isn't your particular cup of earl grey hot, and no, it doesn't look a lot like classic Paramount era Star Trek, that doesn't make it some sort of 1 star travesty, that just makes it different.There is a legitimate issue that they lay on the bleakness of everything and the misery of everyone incredibly thick through the establishing episodes. I can see how this is offputting to those wanting the eternally optimistic Trek of TNG. But part of what made the first couple seasons of TNG so mediocre is Roddenberry's dictate that all the characters had to have no conflict with each other. So while the 2020 angst of this one is overblown, I'll take overwrought conflict over no conflict any day. And it was establishing a starting point. The season ended is a much less bleak and dystopian place than it began. I'd say it was a tacked on happy ending, but honestly the tacked on happy endingness with everything tied up in a neat package was the cheesiest, most 90s Trek thing about it.It definitely takes its sweet time to get anywhere (episode 1 seems like it has Picard ready to set out on his quest, yet somehow it takes until the end of episode 3 to get off planet.). The fact that we in the audience learn where the person he is setting out to find is in episode two makes it taking him until the end of episode 5 seem like some unnecessary stretching. The expansive whole season plot is another way in which it is sort of the opposite of TNG, where every episode had to end with everything resolved (and any guest characters gone and never mentioned again). It feels like some pace in between these extremes would be better, but I prefer a bit on the slow side to underdeveloping things.I'm sure if you set out to hate this you will succeed in doing so. I'm sure if you are lukewarm on it having a couple of the episodes in the first half not really seem to significantly advance the plot is a bummer. I, binged it all over a couple days, and might have not got into it enough to get hooked if I had to wait and watch it one episode a week. But, having waited for the season to finish, it was a lot easier to put up with a lackluster episode or a frustrating episode ending because I could cue up the sequel immediately.I watched it on Amazon Prime's CBS service, and they place the ads seemingly at random. Cuts mid-sentence, completely spoiling several dramatic moments. It's the only thing that really bothered me about this series.","rating":"8\/10","date":"25 August 2020"}
{"title":"Picard has idealism of the character with the ghosts of life","review":"I wanted to give this a better score than I did but there are clearly some things that hurt it.I think the fact that they start from a place we didn't have any historical context for and then proceeded to use events that we had to be told about instead of see sort of sucked.Honestly they would have used the time better had somewhere mid second episode we had gotten the mars clip interspersed with the ultimatum and finally the withdraw from the Romulus relocation. They spent a lot of time in the first half of the story breaking the show don't tell rule.That said I was always engaged and felt like watching the next episode it never left me in the I forgot I had an episode for two weeks state.I agree that the removal of borg tech scene was to visceral for this offering.Picard reminds us all that if you are to take the moral highground you must live to a higher standard of \"good\" or risk being a hypocrit.All in I enjoyed this series which I can't really say for Discovery.","rating":"8\/10","date":"27 March 2020"}

{"title":"the return of the once and future king...of Star Trek","review":"Here's a question for you. Do you know what makes for a good Star Trek show? You know who else doesn't know the answer? CBS. After the golden era of Star Trek that was the late 80's until the early 2000's, the network entered a creative dry spell that, for me, has lasted until Patrick Stewart returned to helm this new show. Discovery attempted to revive the Star Trek universe but made so many changes that it was barely recognizable as Star Trek anymore, and then heaped so much politics on top that it alienated a significant portion of its audience. In the end it got so uncomfortable that it felt like you were making a statement just by watching it, and that feeling was made worse by the producers and actors suggesting that anyone who didn't like every aspect were secretly racist or misogynistic.But some of us just want some science fiction and a bit of escapist fantasy about a future where humanity spreads out into the universe seeking the unknown. Picard is a return to that concept, catching up to Jean-Luc in his picturesque but not very happy retirement on his family vineyard. As it turns out, his retirement wasn't so much a reward for a lifetime of service as it was a retreat from society, as it is revealed that Jean-Luc has taken a public stand against the prevailing sentiment of society. Instead of being honored for his past work, he is rejected and ridiculed at nearly every turn, save from a few close friends who share his minority view of the world.His retirement is interrupted by the arrival of a new life form on his doorstep; one with a connection to a departed friend. His efforts to resolve a mystery reveal a conspiracy at work within Star Fleet and awaken within him a renewed sense of purpose. It's bittersweet, to be honest, seeing the once indomitable Jean-Luc Picard clutching the rail to catch his breath during a flight from attackers or the open pity you sometimes see in the eyes of old comrades when they see him again for the first time in decades.He is old, and this is probably his last adventure, and the show doesn't shy away from those facts. But at the same time seeing him motivated by a new purpose and desire to stand up for an old friend brings a renewed vigor and sense of pride. We all get old, that is inevitable, but shrinking from our ideals isn't, and seeing Picard stand up and fight for what he believes in took me back to my childhood in a great way.It was a return to the Star Trek universe I remembered. One that is idealistic and unabashedly optimistic about human nature, and I really enjoyed it. Based upon what I've seen in the first episodes, I hope it gets a good long run.","rating":"9\/10","date":"6 February 2020"}
{"title":"If you love NG skip this","review":"We've taken an Amazon Prime account because of this series and it's good there's more in Prime Video than Picard.Picard has become the laughingstock of the Federation, the Romulans and almost everyone he meets. By seeing an android girl killed by some Romulan task force for reasons are explained later but are still vague even after watching all episodes he decide to start some wild goose chase. Patrick Stewart approaches the age of 80 but why is he depicted as an old indecisive man in the series? NG characters are mainly there to be there and don't play a key role except for a brief moment, at best. The Federation is more like a corrupt government. New characters are not appealing. Most of them have an hidden agenda, probably the writers thought that this would spice up their attractiveness, but no, it doesn't. Computer graphics sometimes barely exceed the Original Series level and speed of action, often too high nowadays, is too slow here. Finally: after watching all episodes I still have insufficient the idea where it was all about.If you liked the intelligent plots of the NG where issues were solved with what humanity has developed into, in that era, you will most likely not rate this show any higher than I do. I was trying to discover why the average rating is so much higher and found the '10 star' ratings with little explanation why. I think the 1-4 star ratings much better explain why a low rating would be more appropriate.We won't need Amazon Prime Video for season 2 - unless perhaps it will be something totally different from season 1.","rating":"4\/10","date":"1 June 2020"}
{"title":"Second review after finishing season 1","review":"Well.... I was wrong....so I raised my rating to 10 from 5. After the incessant melodrama and overacting witnessed in the first few episodes, I thought it was going to fall down flat. I am happy to report that it didn't. The actors got it together and made it very enjoyable indeed. Of course Sir Patrick Stewart was phenomenal, seeing commander Data was awesome. To top it off, the end of the season was epic, and I hope there is a season two. I really miss a good Star Trek show. This one filled the void rather well.EDIT: I am now in season 3, and I am far from disappointed. This is the Star Trek I was hoping for, but better. Much better. I am very happy I stuck with it, and I very much look forward to more. Season 3 is feature length movie series worthy... and that's saying something.","rating":"10\/10","date":"28 March 2020"}

{"title":"crybaby naysayers.....","review":"All the bad reviews seem to be people that are crying because this is not a reboot of STNG or some new version of that. They seem upset but the lack of continuity or some other BS purest line of gobbledy-gook. I have been watching ST since before the first movie and am still re-watching shows so I am not new to these people and these BS complaints. What everyone seems to forget is that this is first and foremost make believe, sci-fi, fantasy and most important, entertainment. This is not a history or non-fiction documentary of actual events.SO as to my ultimately pointless view of the show...........it is not that bad, there are some clich\u00e9s and obvious \"plot-twists\" but over all this is a good show. They did a very good job with severing the old STNG from Picard and creating the new show. Some of the things they added like Rafi's family issues are completely useless and take away from the show instead of adding to it. Overall it is a good addition to the ST world with attempting to be STNG again.","rating":"9\/10","date":"22 December 2020"}

Enjoy your tribbles while you can, but the truth is that the Trek universe is not a pretty place, and I'm glad to see they show that. Especially seeing Borg harvested for their parts... THAT HAPPENS IN OUR WORLD. Is it so disappointing that the Picard universe suggests it? Ya'll can shut up with your complaints.

They've taken the franchise into a new direction, ditching all the things that made Star Trek great; character development, deep subject matter, moral dilemmas, diplomacy, TREKKING THE UNIVERSE!? And replaced it with violence, vapid plots, characters you couldn't care less about and more violence.It's just sad, at a time like this, we could have really used some TNG Picard to lift our spirits, but instead we got Alex Kurtzman Picard.

{"title":"I didn't like and then I really liked it.","review":"When I first started to watch ST Picard, I found it a trial. It was only when I realised that each episode was being treated like part of a larger motion picture, that I became really engaged. And that is part of the beauty of this series. Each episode is so deliberate in its rendering of each character and place, that I started to feel as if I was watching something quite wonderful appear, Yes, it has its flaws. We have to remember that we're not living in the Star Trek of the pre digital era. This has some great characters, least of which obviously, is (Patrick Stewart) the aging Jean-Luc Picard, but also a much more grounded 7-of-9. Oh, and a peculiar young fellow that keeps reminding me of, Dwayne 'the rock' Johnson in something where he acted as a spider or something. Anyway, this dudes character, played by Evan Evagora, is a bit clich\u00e9 as 'Elnor'. Raised by a sisterhood that taught him their ways, which hold him and Picard in good stead for their journey, I hope to see more of him. We have appearance by some of the Next Generation crew, (yes, some did end up living happily ever after) but it doesn't diminish the story. Yes, of course, there's goodies, baddies and then the usual conflicted android and of course, those that know that they're going to put it all on the line etc.,. But that is not to take anything away from the start of something that could prove to be quite wonderful. If it is allowed to continue.","rating":"9\/10","date":"9 April 2021"}
{"title":"Star Trek comes in different flavours now","review":"I don't write a lot of reviews but seeing the significant amount of negative sentiment being expressed toward this series I wanted to share my thoughts.ST:P tells a story from the experiences of people living in the shadow of Starfleet. It's something we're not accustomed to and it's okay not to like that. That said, it's important to recognize that just because something isn't what we wanted it to be it doesn't mean it's inherently bad. ST:P is good TV. It tells some captivating and emotionally engaging stories in a grittier world than we're used to in the Star Trek Universe.To refer back to my title, we have Star Trek available in a number of flavours now. Star Trek has always been a commentary of the socio-political landscape and it still is. If you want that commentary in darker, grittier season-long arcs, you've got Picard. If you want something that has the more optimistic, hopeful, and perhaps slightly more sterile feel of the Kelvin timeline movies, you've got Discovery. If you want to harken back to the episodic storytelling of old with a shiny new veneer, you've got Strange New Worlds. The Star Trek franchise can cater to a wider audience without that being a bad thing. It's okay if not all of the Star Trek universe is for everyone.","rating":"9\/10","date":"10 October 2022"}
{"title":"Enigmatic and thoughtful","review":"Stewart has aged, a lot, but still provides a thoughtful, enigmatic and memorable last hoorah performance as JLP.Some details may be list on true fans, but the show kept me coming back until the end.An emotional, If somewhat rushed, journey to the retirement of a character and Star Trek legend.Old and new characters perform well to provide long term fans with surprises, and new depth.I loved it, and wished there were more.....","rating":"9\/10","date":"10 May 2022"}

{"title":"Guess the writers don't know what makes Star Trek different from other sci-fi","review":"In most sci-fi we see how humans have advanced technology and all the downsides to said technology. Or sci-fi go the route of apocalyptic futures.\nStar Trek however was different. It showed us a bright future for humanity with very little downsides to the technologies that the future brings.Alas no one told the writers of Picard this.The future is now a depressing place again. Addiction, poverty and classism are back in Picard. Everything the Federation has stood for since Archer took the first warp ship into space has been negated within a time span of 30 years.We get treated to a myriad of inconsistencies with the old series. Old series often left me thinking about morals, spirituality and science after an episode. Picard just leaves me with questions on why they had to ruin a franchise just to make a generic scifi show.The acting seems fine. Old characters seem out of character. Space battles seem boring, despite the modern special effects they never get suspenseful like the fights in TNG, Voyager or DS9.\nAfter watching 3 series with bad special effects lasers I was ready to finally see a faser beam tear across the hull.........instead we get all these quick flashy shots that leave you with very little idea of what is happening in the battle.Star Trek Picard is just a TON of missed chances. They could've given star trek fans what they have been yearning for for over 19(?) years.\nInstead we get this awful looking future and boring spacefights.Also..........Romulans now have a Legolas from LOTR......it's a thing.....I dunno how or why......I started writing this wanting to give picard a 5 star review. But after typing it out,.......I'll give it 2 star......and still feel like I'm being generous.","rating":"2\/10","date":"26 March 2020"}

I was hoping for a show similar to Next Generations especially that they hired most cast from it.Unfortunately this is not it! Not even close to it!!In simple terms this version is dull. A lot of scenes when they eating,drinking,talking it's just killing the action.I was always wondering what a great series Next Generation would be if they only had access to better special effects.In ST:Picard special effects are great but scenario is flat and boring.I've got distinct impression that the speed of action matches the age of actors.

{"title":"Season 2 is awful, just awful.","review":"Really bad. Literally makes no sense at any stage. No logic to it when you think of previous Star Trek (pre new films) and no logic to it when you think of coherent writing. It's like they had 30 different writers all writing their bit with no talking to each other or even knowledge of what the others were doing. Think Game of Thrones last season but fifty times worse.Out of respect for Patrick Stewart (and because I have Amazon Prime) I finished it but it was tough to do. Actually the 21st century Doctor was class so that helped but aside from that just shocking.I am terrified if these writers have anything to do with the next season and what that will do to the Star Trek TNG cast. Hopefully they will get hands on and make sure it isn't as bad as this was.","rating":"1\/10","date":"6 May 2022"}
{"title":"Excellent... Much better than expected..","review":"I would say this is probably the third best series of Star Trek so far.... TOS easily the best and TNG a solid 2nd. Very solid. HBO level production. Much more exciting than I thought it would be as I was expecting a boring drama... Also, interesting that it is in fact borrowing core elements heavily from Battlestar Galactica. All confirmed by episode 8.No matter what, I do love it. Surprised to see so many neg reviews... let's face it, there has not been a halfway decent Star Trek series since TNG. Mostly soap opera style science drama garbage... Deep Space 9, Enterprise (really bad), Voyager (eh, mostly ok) but all pretty bland. Give me a break.","rating":"8\/10","date":"27 March 2020"}
{"title":"Season 2 is Horrible!!","review":"Season 1 was OK, not great but OK, at least after years of no good Star Trek (Discovery was weak and not very good). Season 2 is horrific! First, a storyline that is very overused in Star Trek, time travel, and then not done well. Poor writing, poor story, and then, wow. They had to go Hollywood leftist and get woke. Why not, you've done everything else to upset your fans, let's just throw in social commentary in a science fiction entertainment show. I know Roddenberry did it in TOS, but much more subtly. Not the woke agenda way. After episode 4, I can't take it anymore and done. Maybe season 3 will be better but I don't have high hopes.","rating":"2\/10","date":"3 May 2023"}
{"title":"Perfect Start","review":"Picard establishes itself as a series of its own, even when employing the talents of the Next Generation cast. It's clear we're going to see something new out of Star Trek. It certainly isn't the Star Trek that fans are used to seeing, but then, Star Trek: The Next Generation was also hated by many fans of the Original Star Trek. We feel betrayed that they'd \"trade-in\" the old story-telling ways, in favor of the ultra fast talking, multi-line story waves, turning complexity into something that was once fascinating into something we have to decode. That is the way stories are told now and like Picard, we have to navigate this process and fit in with the new. We have to grow into this new world make it.I want to watch season 2 before making any other judgements. I personally enjoyed season 1 while trying to figure out the story-telling formula. I'll have to find out if I really do like this as a series in the next.","rating":"10\/10","date":"27 January 2020"}
{"title":"TNG is back at last :)","review":"I don't normally write reviews, but feel as a life long Treckie, that I have to try and say something to negate all the unjustified bad reviews. I want to say a big thank you to Sir Patrick for taking on his role again. It is heart warming and emotionaly to see Jean Luc Picard and other Next Gen cast back on our screens again. I also want to say a huge thanks to all the cash and crew for making this beautifuly crafted production possible. What I'd say to all the nay sayers is, if you want to watch Next Gen or Captain Kirk, go watch them, they were and still are awesome. But it's 2020 and the way the stories are told on TV are very different as are the special effects. I feel that both this show and discovery have done a great job of bringing Star Trek into the modern times and it's freaking awesome to see it on our screens again.

Suck on that you little gits.So sad to see so many fools who call them Star Trek fans who never seem to have actually learned anything from it.I've been a huge Star Trek fan since the 1960's and am very disappointed in all the little whiners claiming to be Star Trek fans. I pity you all.Meanwhile, I'll be the fortunate one enjoying a great series with great actors, scripts and more...and at least two more seasons in the pipeline. Plus two other shows with two or three more in the pipelines.You little pissant whiners don't deserve new Star Trek. Go watch your DVDs of the old series and quit whining. You're annoyingly the real fans.This episode was Star Trek at it's finest and most original. Truly, lives up to the mission: To seek out new life and new civilizations, to boldly go where no one has gone before.Don't miss an episode of the new Trek!

{"title":"Fresh","review":"If you are expecting Next Generation, you may not care for it. This is a much more modern take. If you read the tie in book, it really sets up the story well.

{"title":"S-l-o-w","review":"A friend told me, \"well, that's what series are nowadays. In the first several episodes, nothing happens, everything in crammed into the last two episodes of a season, and it ends on a cliffhanger to make you watch the next season.\" Perhaps that is what TV is like now, and it probably explains why I don't own a TV, pay for cable, or pay for any streaming service. (I saw 2 episodes of this at a friend's house and the first one free when it was all over for free.)This is like Chinese kung-fu wirework movies crossed with a vague generic dark SF movie. The music overpowers the dialog, so no intimate moments are allowed to play with just acting carrying it. Not that the poor actors have a script to work with. I feel for them. I ache with longing for the art of Melinda Snodgrass and Harlan Ellison.Honestly, I didn't need to add my review except I could see the shill reviews that began this and keep the rating inflated far beyond what real viewers are feeling about it. This is pernicious practice that makes me want to quit streaming the occasional movie I do stream. I've quit going to movies, for why support a bunch of gropers and their lined pockets? But I digress. Or, I don't. CBS, after all, is one of those corporations that allowed such things and may still, for all I know. People of good morals should probably avoid all their shows.People with good taste should definitely avoid THIS show. It's bad.IMDB, don't allow new reviewers to review TV shows until episode 10. Only allow established users to do so.Then your site won't be quite such a joke.","rating":"1\/10","date":"23 February 2020"}

{"title":"Really really great.","review":"I almost didn't watch the show because of all the negative reviews. I have never left a review on IMDB but felt called to because I couldn't find a single positive review. I found this show to be more like a 10 episode movie. The story telling was original, the characters were solid, and the visual effects were excellent.This isn't TNG or Discovery. It's a modern Star Trek that deals with modern issues. But it's a deep Star Trek that makes a statement and tells a poignant and exciting story over ten episodes.I have been disappointed by most of the StarTrek franchises since TNG and Discovery. I grew up on both of those shows and relished the sense of galactic exploration that they embodied. Picard is a different kind of story, but it's original and keeps you engaged.The is some of the best sci fi I've seen in years. Thank you for finally making a good Star Trek show. Please don't listen to all the negative reviews. This is definitely worth watching.","rating":"10\/10","date":"7 June 2020"}

I've given up now, in Episode three where ICE agents are revealed to be a greater threat than The Borg - harassing poor undocumented immigrants from the future.All against a backdrop of California's wildfires, shown as a portent of the climate catastrophe that is coming.In addition, don't expect any stiff upper lip from Picard. You'll see that upper lip quiver in indignation many times though, whenever something hurtful or unfair happens.What a shame.","rating":"1\/10","date":"25 March 2022"}

{"title":"A touching, introspective series with just enough nostalgia for TNG","review":"This isn't just more of the same Star Trek we've known and loved in the past, if those shows were still viable they'd still be making them. This show is, as suggested by the title, about Picard. It focuses on how this once great man who embodied the principles of Starfleet has been rejected by them, while also dealing with the debilitating effects of aging. Season one was a final fling for Picard as he reconciled personal failures and reclaimed the values that made TNG so great - bravery, courage, and morality. I don't think you can get anymore Trek than that.I would have awarded 10 stars but I don't think swearing had any place in Star Trek.","rating":"9\/10","date":"6 May 2020"}

{"title":"Very promising","review":"After watching the opening episode I feel like this will be a great continuation from TNG. It's not TNG and never could be but it looks like it wants to do it justice.Stewart slots right back in as Picard. I've no doubt the next few episodes will see him turn from a slightly tired old retired Star Fleet admiral, into something more reminiscent of prime Picard.I think they have done a good job of keeping TNG style, and the style of 'proper' Star Trek in general. Definitely the opposite of what they tried to do with Discovery.Don't go in expecting TNG and you will enjoy it.","rating":"8\/10","date":"27 January 2020"}

Cant really walk\/move or act anymore.I stopped watching during ep4 as it was just woke nonsense. Then i heard about the other cast coming back for the last season. So i thought i'd get through this one so that I could follow the next one as i want to see Worf, Beverly etc.And i managed that by fast forwarding most of it. Boring. Boring. Boring.

This show should have been for us, the OG star trek fans who have been waiting for a new series since Voyager.I saw Brannon braga had producer credits for the orville on some episodes.

Picard, supported by an interesting crew, gallivanting throughout the galaxy and heading off to god knows where for season 02. Lets hope Chabon and CBS don't screw this up.If this sounds like an apologists review, fret not, I'm old, and at this point I'll take Patrick Stewart reading the NYC phone book over ST.Discovery any day.\nSo stop hating like I used to and just enjoy the ride while you can; savour the wonderful cameos and rejoice that Picard is back in action.","rating":"10\/10","date":"27 March 2020"}

It's a fun show, with good visuals and it's interesting to see what the old cast look like now.Don't expect sheakspearian dialogue and just let yourself switch off for 40 odd mins.Not sure why it gets such bad reviews, it's a bit like the new Lord of the Rings TV show. Brilliant TV but lower than average reviews. Again, attributed to diehard fans who probably had to gouge their eyes out whilst wearing their costumes.Anyway, as a non die hard trekkie and sci fi enthusiast, I am enjoying it, especially season 3 and rate this at a solid 8.I do feel sorry for the die hard fans, they will never be able to enjoy a new Star trek show on TV, because nothing is ever going to be good enough for them, while at the same time appealing to the greatest audience, which is where the money comes from sadly.","rating":"8\/10","date":"6 March 2023"}

Discovery, Lower Decks, the shorts, everything from the last few years has been so utterly disappointing. But Picard season 3 is a masterpiece.After being convinced that those behind the helm of \"New Trek\" in fact HATED Star Trek and had not a drop of respect for its past, Picard season 3 has swooped in, proving me wrong, with Terry Matalas expertly weaving an engaging new Star Trek story. A story that makes sense in canon, respects the characters, and most importantly, reminds us of what Star Trek can be; a glimpse at what humanity could be and a freakin' cool space show.","rating":"9\/10","date":"21 April 2023"}
{"title":"Terribly inconsistent quality writing","review":"The production quality is really nice, however every episode is written by different people and that fact is so painfully noticeable. Some episodes are actually quite alright, and then the next one will just be painfully bad.","rating":"5\/10","date":"8 May 2022"}
{"title":"I kinda liked it!","review":"This is a different Star Trek. It's pretty and expensive looking. The writing is JJ'ish and maybe a little simple when you bring in an omnipotent being into the equation. You know that if Q is testing or teaching humanity, it all will be right at the season finale. Just enjoy the visuals and hope that the writers don't kill a fan favorite to boost ratings. I'm good with enjoying the ride without being overly critical. TOS is still my favorite but I have enough room in my heart for these other series. Patrick is long in the tooth so please no fight scenes!","rating":"8\/10","date":"4 March 2022"}
{"title":"Season 3 is interesting and watchable - I will add it to my Full Star Trek collection","review":"I am still not a fan of Kurtzman's Dark Mirrorverse, I have in my collection every Star Trek show and movie till 2009 reboot. Star Trek by JJ Abrams, Discovery, Strange New Worlds can be nice, but it's not my cup of tea. Well, even the Expanse is not for me. I found Picard Season 1 to be nothing special, so I didn't watch Season 2. I watched Season 3 only to say farewell and was very surprised. This season had some great ideas (which ended too soon), few really beautiful scenes and many many pieces of Star Trek history (including Ships tech details) and lots of \"easter eggs\". It was more than enough to pass my personal sci-fi collection filter. I'm not a purist or snob, but It's getting hard for me to follow new space sc-fi shows, because in my opinion the quality is declining since StarGate:Universe and Dark Matter (which I generally like). I caught myself thinking that many episodes of campy Legends of Tomorrow and Flash (Arrowverse) had more Sci-fi feeling than new space sci-fi shows. Speaking of quality. It was hip to laugh at cheap sets from 60-80s era and to mock ugly CGI from 90s, but what do you say now? Yes, those sets were cheap, but it were Sets. You could feel it through the screen. Yes, CGI from 90s was simple and ugly sometimes, but the pictures were bold and imaginative. And not forget Lighting. As an artist I could talk about poor lighting these days all day. Nevertheless, I like Picard Season 3. You should (must) watch it if you are fan of TNG, DS9 and Voyager.","rating":"10\/10","date":"21 April 2023"}
{"title":"Only Season 3 is worth watching","review":"Season 1 was ok. I thought that Season 2 would improve having introduced us to new characters. Unfortunately, season 2 was awful. The writing was really poor, and the story had been done before - many times. Nothing new.I can only imagine that new writers were brought in for Season 3. The new characters disappeared, and the \"old\" generation were re-introduced. It was a matter of back to basics. Back to Star Trek Lore - excuse the pun.Season 3 is a triumph. Season 3 is what Star Trek is about. I couldn't wait for the next episode to arrive. It's such a shame that this is the final season of Picard.Let's hope that the next season of Discovery improves is a similar manner.","rating":"8\/10","date":"21 April 2023"}
{"title":"The third season is epic!","review":"The first season got off to a slow start, but it was watchable and you could live with it. The second season played around with a storyline. You couldn't exactly put your finger on, but they were getting it together.The third season, they just blew every other Star Trek Story out of the water. Brilliant writing, brilliant acting, everything felt right and fell into place. A couple of things that could've been better, but I think they ran out of space, literally.In the end, the third season, brought everything into context , and they hit the nail on the head. A couple of graphic hiccups, but actually not worth mentioning since it was so well put together.Live long and prosper.","rating":"10\/10","date":"27 April 2023"}
{"title":"Snoozefest which panders to fan service","review":"The first season had some promise to it. Admittedly not much as making star trek whilst pandering to new sensitivities would be difficult for anyone. However there are some (as in a lot) of problems. Firstly the story, season two started of well, however the story stretched on with no material. The story diverges to sub plots that I couldn't care about. Second there is the fan service, the director doesn't understand what an Easter egg is. They insert snippets from Star Trek's past in order to pander to the fans but having a solid story would of worked better. Going back to the story, nothing happens most of the time with a couple of romantic sub plots. If I wanted to watch a soap opera I would watch one. In a nutshell if you want to watch decent trek then go back to the wrath of khan.","rating":"1\/10","date":"1 May 2022"}
{"title":"Nostalgia 1o1","review":"Season 1 wet the appetite and I was on board with the series, it wasn't amazing but it was good, season 2 was AWFUL! I struggled to watch it and was beyond disappointed, when season 3 came out I avoided watching it until it was all released, apart from it being abit of a remake of the next generation and the first few episodes being a little iffy, I stuck with it and binged the series in one go and it did not disappoint! By the end I was hooked and loving it! Clearly they put alot more effort into this season which I'm assuming will be the last and I hope it is, far to many shows drag it out and just turn into dribble. Thoroughly recommend season 3!","rating":"8\/10","date":"22 April 2023"}
{"title":"Not Star Trek-","review":"Star Trek is my fave old-school sci-fi. However, I was disappointed with that tired old \"save the future by traveling to the past\" story. It seems they've run out of ideas. Yeah, the names and terminologies are familiar, but this has devolved into Picard's angst-ridden self-indulgent search for some sort of closure involving his mother. I want an old-fashioned SPACE ADVENTURE. These characters are running all over the place on earth in 2024, not Star-Trekkin'","rating":"4\/10","date":"15 April 2022"}
{"title":"This is really good stuff!","review":"We were always most interested in the Jean Luc Picard character in The Next Generation. Sometimes remote - almost tortured at times, but strong, Jean Luc was always intriguing. There was always a lot going on \"behind the scenes\" - the backplot. Star Trek: Picard gives us some of that backplot - and it's really good stuff!We really liked this! It's as good as any of the best Star Trek out there. The new characters are good. The scripts and stories are good - strong and believable. There is all of what makes the Star Trek milieu interesting: politics, big reveals, good action, travel, character interactions and learning. Star Trek: Picard has it all across all 3 series.No spoilers - but it all comes to one big celebration in the final series. If you are a \"Trekie\" then you will have already seen this and won't be offended.Watch Star Trek: Picard - it's really good stuff!","rating":"8\/10","date":"7 May 2023"}

{"title":"The best Star Trek since 1999 -- by far","review":"This reviewer's background, for you to put my words into a context: I'm a huge Star Trek fan since 1987, when I started with the Original Series, have seen all Star Trek shows and movies ever since multiple times, was active in the fandom for a while and have read about 300 Star Trek novels. Star Trek has almost the status of a religion for me. This is where this review comes from.That said, I've not always loved everything about Star Trek. TOS, TNG and DS9 are my favorites, I love each of them and could never decide between them -- but in my opinion, even back in the 90s, VOY set a yardstick for poor, badly written and utterly childish Star Trek. And although I found ENT was a considerable improvement over VOY, it never quite reached the first three show's brilliance (though season 4 came close).I'm not a \"NuTrek\" hater. The new movies are mindless popcorn fun and I could enjoy them as such, but I was missing the depth \"old\" Star Trek used to have in its best times. Similarly mixed are my feelings about Discovery: While this new show is technically brilliant and superficially entertaining, its season 2 nods to TOS nice, its characterizations are lacking and its storyarcs -- pardon my language -- dramatically aimless BS.Long story short: Ever since DS9 went off the air in 1999, I was looking to find the old brilliance in new Star Trek, without success, despite its occasionally successes at mildly entertaining me.Then came \"Picard\" -- and after 3 episodes, I'm blown away. It's *exactly* the show I have been hoping for all the time! I'd go so far saying it's like I hoped the TNG movies would be, back in the 90s, but failed to be. \"Picard\" is to TNG, what the TOS movies were to TOS. Making up for the mostly poor big screen entries that followed the tv show.And, frankly, I am totally at loss understanding where all the negativity in the bad reviews here stems from. \"Unintelligent\", \"dark and gritty\", \"pessimistic\", \"action oriented\" -- when critics use these words to describe Picard, I have a very hard time believing they were watching the same show I watched.On the contrary. For the first time in decades, I feel we have *intelligent* Star Trek again. Finally there are Star Trek authors who know how to read, who make literary references or use self-irony: Like a Picard who says about Asimov's \"Complete Robot\" that he never found a relation to SF. Or a rogue Captain who reads Unamuno's \"Sentimiento Tragico\" -- a heroic Don Quijote character obviously, I'm curious to learn about how he'll handle the tragedy of a lost cause -- and programmed an MHN after his image to externalize his inner monologues. At least hints at a meta-discussion about the meaning of myth, narratives and truth at the example of the Romulan concept of \"mythology\" (we'll see where this will lead). This is *smart*. In fact, it's the smartest Star Trek in decades. And in best TNG tradition, a show that had lots of references to the history of mind and science, from Shakespeare over Sigmund Freud to Steven Hawking playing himself in a poker game with Einstein.And is Picard \"pessimistic\" or \"dark\"? Well. I'd say it's at least not \"darker\" than DS9 (and I never found DS9 \"pessimistic\", despite its darkness). On the contrary, I find Picard hope inspiring -- because it reflects our current state of the world. Just like \"old\" Star Trek did in its best times. For me, Picard's approach couldn't work better. Just like I witnessed my happy optimism of the 90s, after the end of the Cold War, the \"end of history\", crumble after 9\/11 in 2001, when the Western World saw a surge of paranoia, fear and militarism, Picard's personal history was shaped by a similar event, the android attack on Mars, 15 years prior to the new show. And just like the current state of world politics, the rise of ignorance, populism, authoritarian government everywhere, disinformation, fake news, hate on the internet and meddling of autocratic foreign powers, the once great Starfleet is fallen into paranoia, prejudice and infested with Romulan influence.That a person that stands for ethics and integrity like no one else, my dear Jean-Luc Picard, finds himself now in a similar situation as I find myself in when I read the newspapers, allows me to identify with him like never before. And that he will most likely be able to once again change the world for the better, is incredibly hope-inspring. Just the fix I need in these dark times when reality looks bleak.Yeah, I understand, some old fans are missing the \"idyllic, ideal world\" of TNG, the \"mobile living room\" that was the Enterprise-D. Perhaps the same people who hated DS9 back in the 90s. Fair enough. If that's where the bashers and haters come from, I can see where they come from. Picard is not that kind of show. But I'm glad Picard is not a rehash of the old formula we have seen hundreds of times before, on TNG and VOY.Just like each show, from TOS to DS9, was one step forward in the evolution of Star Trek storytelling, Picard is the next logical step (after VOY, ENT, NuTrek and DSC failed to go forward -- both on the time scale, as storytelling-wise). Its storyarc is more complex. Its serialized format allows for a much larger scope (the next logical step after DS9 broadened Star Trek's scope by telling longer arcs). But at the same time, while I feel it's an expansion, it couldn't be truer to the spirit I loved about TNG.It's fresh and relevant to today's real world -- not a rehash of old 90s storytelling. But at the same time maintains Star Trek's soul, by applying it to a world that has changed in the past 20 years.I've never enjoyed watching new Star Trek as much as the first three episodes of \"Picard\", ever since the DS9 finale in 1999.Clearly 10 of 10 stars from me -- though I might reevaluate this rating, if the remaining episodes turn out to be a disappointment. But so far, I see no indication that they will.","rating":"10\/10","date":"9 February 2020"}

Then series 2 happened . It was superbly written to include everything I remember needing to have an ending.Q needed an ending , he was too critical to the story to just not appear again after the 'all good things' episode aired\nBorg needed an ending , annihilating perhaps , but this was perfection\nWesley Crusher needed an ending , those who have no idea why he needs an ending do not understand TNG\nBrilliantly done in just a minute or so !Overall , perfection for any ST fan who as a 55 yo I can say if I missed an episode when it first aired, I missed the episode, full stop !Overall 2, it's like making all loose ends of a tapestry (pun intended) tie up , shame I had to wait 30 years !Great tv , great acting, great story, great sci-fi.","rating":"10\/10","date":"11 May 2022"}

{"title":"Another disappointing Kurtzman era Star Trek","review":"As a huge fan of The Next Generation series and Patrick Stewart as Picard, this does not live up to that at all.I think many of us were hoping for a continuation of The Next Generation but with some twist to explain why he's back at it and spends more time on Earth but it doesn't look or feel like TNG at all. A few other TNG cast members in their characters are involved but it's mostly all new cast\/characters.As other comments mentioned, it is missing the Roddenberry optimism about the future. Yes, conflicts will always be there but this series keeps bringing up present issues as if everyone isn't fully aware already, especially among those who would watch this. And so many scenes are extremely dark visually. Really, there is more than enough dark and dystopian sci-fi films and TV shows out there already.Pretty much everything Star Trek related has been disappointing or worse since the end of Deep Space 9 and Voyager, though they were not as great as The Next Generation either. There was a significant shift in style in the 2000s and especially by the late 2000s with the original series film reboot under Kurtzman.","rating":"5\/10","date":"14 April 2022"}

{"title":"Season 3 was a concept confused and an opportunity lost","review":"What to make of Season 3. Part nostalgia, not just TNG but elements of the whole pre 2006 era Star Yrek. Part do-over of Nemesis' far from Stella send off of the TNG cast. And part, so it is said, closing the loop on the character of Picard.It really doesn't achieve any of this, or anything else.The nostalgia is too obvious and stitched together. From parts of scripts ripped word for word and whole chunks of music from previous movies and TV episode, to random elements stitched together into the plot of this series. It's like a fan-edit and fan-fiction.It brings the cast together, sure, and it is great to see the friends and family of the TNG cast back together. But it feels very much like a reunion of the cast, not a reunion of the characters. Enjoyable to an extent, but missing something.And what of closure for Picard. Well Tapestry of Life as an episode was much more satisfying than anything offered here.The series offers nothing original, and little depth or compelling elements. The CGI is video game like. And despite trying to make the Enterprise D the hero again, the poor CGI and writing making it look small and toy like.It's a shame. But, the soundtrack, borrowing liberally from greats Goldsmith and Horner, and I'd swear Cliff Eidelman, I'd a triumph.In short enjoy the music, skip the first eight episodes that are filler, and enjoying seeing the cast back together in the final two with minimal expectations.","rating":"4\/10","date":"1 June 2023"}
{"title":"A good start... Don't expect the old format.","review":"There are a good deal of positive reviews on here, so I won't respin what's already been said. 9\/10 - brilliant.. And... Patrick, you are a truly wonderful actor.To address some of the bad reviews, however; Some people are wanting the show to be like TNG, or even TOS. I find this an odd attitude for several reasons:1. If one didn't accomedate for a newer generation's tastes, one would make no money, and there would be no Trek.2. The only sci-fi to successfully return to it's roots has been Red Dwarf (IMO). This is because it is suppposed to be 'low budget' and 'cheeky'. If the sets from TNG were bought back you would not be able to take the show seriously, as the audiences suspension of disbelief would not tolerate the wobbly walls and terrible effects (and some truly awful acting from guests in parts, let's be honest!)3. Nowadays people expect plots which span multiple episodes\\series, as opposed to everything returning to the status que after just one episode. And why not? Can you really tell a good story in 45 minutes?For me, it's a bit like going back to a computer game I loved as a child. Compared to the modern computer games, old games such as \"manic miner\", \"Space Invaders\", etc seem incredibly quaint - somewhat laughable. Should all new games be in this format still? (Hint: No.)To enjoy Picard, stop expecting the past and accept the new series as what it is - a good story in the TNG universe being told well.Lastly, I couldn't help but laugh at the irony of the fans wanting to live in the past, as it mirrors some of Picard's feelings in the show.","rating":"9\/10","date":"26 January 2020"}
{"title":"Immortalize Picard","review":"I believe Star Trek Next Generation was one of the best TV series of all time and Picard an unreplaceable phenomenal character.\nHere is a humble request. Why not use this Picard series to introduce and establish a clone\/synthetic character of the younger Picard alongside the older Picard. Also, to bid goodbye to the older character, leaving behind the younger clone\/synthetic character (digital re-creation) immortalized for all the future (next) generations of Star Trek viewers!","rating":"10\/10","date":"12 February 2020"}

But even though they struggle and come close to oblivion - they ultimately manage to promote peace, harmony and social cohesion in the world.Especially in today's world - when de-escalation of conflicts and peacebuilding is essential - as well repairing environmental problems on Earth by using technology in a responsible and peaceful way - great science fiction series like those are vital. So that humanity can live in peace and harmony one day - which hopefully will be pretty soon :)","rating":"10\/10","date":"16 December 2021"}

{"title":"People who want a Back to the Future 4 will HATE this.","review":"I think people are missing the point. Just like there will never be a Back to the Future 4, there wont be another Star Trek TNG.Honestly, a lot of these reviews I read on here were not great and they all say the same thing. \"Oh it's not like the old Star Trek...\" \"Oh it's too dark and and there's too much lens flair..\" If you want something like the old Star Trek go watch The Orville (which I like BTW).I get that a lot of hardcore fans want more of the same but it's been done. Patrick Stewart said it himself that he wouldn't come back if it's the same old thing. So, it shouldn't be a surprise to people that it's not. I got into TNG because my Dad loves that show and I've seen every single episode. It's one of my favorites. Picard will always be my favorite captain.This show is darker and slower and not episodic and I like it. To me it's more like a long movie that should have been for TNG. All these negative reviews I feel are expecting a TNG reboot and this is not it -- it's not meant to be.In a nutshell, It's about Picard's final mission, and the aftermath of losing his friend Data. A woman comes to him for his help, which uncovers new information that threatens the Federation. If you liked TNG and like more dramatic shows like BSG it's worth the watch. The series is still just beginning so to write a complete review isn't fair. However, so far, I'm enjoying it and we'll see how it plays out.STP is not an exact continuation of TNG the show. It's a different story about Picard, the man, set in the TNG universe. In essence, the creators of the show are following the mantra -- \"to boldly go where no one has gone before.\" It's a show for a new generation.","rating":"9\/10","date":"2 February 2020"}
{"title":"Great Cinematography...Really Poor GFX","review":"So not a bad start...Only a few problems with it which you all probably missed. 1.

The GFX...Yes great cinematography...but Jesus Christ are the the GFX artists working on other shows so you had to rely on your 14 year old son to get it done? Its like 90s spiderman graphics. Cut out the person animate it with a puppet tool and paste it back in...Oh it looks bad...Well just zoom out until it looks good..We are zoomed it so far out when she makes that superhero jump...that it might as well skip it...and where is all the technology. Yes, we know Picard does not love to rely on technology.. but there should still be some tech around everywhere...smart phones or whatever.Really those are my two only complaints...Ohh...except for killing off the main character in episode 1..that was dumb..Who cares if she has a sister..Its not her.Im really trying to grasp why they made Data so important. ..I like the idea of Picard often thinking about Data, and that relationship shaping how Picard feels about Ai...But why did they take that extra step and make it so that Data is the chosen one by God and only his matrix works and blah blah blah...I still enjoyed it.

We're going to gradually find out, why and I suspect how things can be corrected... probably by Picard!Please ignore the moaning few on here who lament next generation and this not being it!Picard seems fairly constant as before... He's a good man with morals that probably should have done more when he quit... Now though he has a chance and he's gonna try and is looking to change things.It's not perfect and my review is only after the 3rd episode, so we will see...

{"title":"To all those claiming that this isn't Star Trek...","review":"It is! It's Trek for the 21st century. Star Trek has always been produced for the time it was airing and this is coming off the back the likes if Game of Thrones, The Walking Dead and even West World.But more importantly, it is post rebooted Battlestar Galactica which came just as Enterprise was on its last legs.The soap opera days of TNG and Voyager are over, and Deep Space Nine was ahead if its time, and introducing THIS very universe which people are complaining about.The main difference was that instead of visiting gangster planets such as Freecloud, the gangsters, rogues and flawed humans visited the station each week.Picard is opening the darker aspects the universe up in ways that Trek has rarely done before, though certainty not never.Its different, it's modern and whilst yes, it runs at a slower pace that previous Trek, I feel that it proceeds at a pace with allows characters to breath and hopefully grow.And just to clarify, this is not a new account set up by a corporation to spin Picard. I am a man in 40's who has watched every Trek show since I was 3 years old.Whilst I love Star Trek I am well aware of its flaws but Picard, whilst not perfect is far from the worst and not deserving of the abuse which it is receiving from so called fans.","rating":"8\/10","date":"28 February 2020"}
{"title":"Enjoyed it and not sure why there's all the hate!","review":"First of all, there were some pacing issues with this show as very little actually happens in the first 5 episodes. After this, it really ramps up and I loved it!Traditionally, Star Trek for me has been quite plot driven and this was a chance to really explore characters in more depth. The unresolved guilt Picard had over what happened with Data was important to resolve and I enjoyed this story with Data and his guilt coming to an end during the final episode of the show.It was also great to see how Riker and Troi are doing now they're settled down and to see some of the things they've had to go through such as losing a child. This made the characters seem more human (just a phrase!) than ever before.A bad point was the swearing. I'm not sure why we need swearing to seem more modern and edgy.

Star Trek has always been inspiring and a relaxing show for me, this is just terrible.Sir Patrick, what have you done!??The makeup department have really gone down the tubes too, Romulans look like a human with teenage HD eyebrows.

I am kinda surprised at reviews I personally really enjoyed the show.I enjoy the season following an arc all the way through, ala season 3 enterprise, maybe some of the negativity was due to people wanting episodes not being connected like older treks? I couldn't say.The only negative thing for me about show was I felt like it tried a little too hard to get an emotional response from audience sometimes which in a few cases was a bit much.All in all the people doing this and discovery are doing a fantastic job in my books, thank you!","rating":"8\/10","date":"13 May 2020"}

{"title":"Completely worthless","review":"Ignore the 10 star reviews by CBS shills, this series is every bit as worthless as Star Trek Discovery. Garbage-bin writing more akin to a soap opera than an A-Grade science fiction show, appallingly moronic characters, idiotic plot, F-Word galore I could go on for hours as to why this abysmal show has NOTHING to do with Star Trek, but I'm sure you can see it for yourselves.

Clearly this series is new and different from any of it's predecessors. Like many things in life, it's not meant to merely mimic or copy something because that would be pointless and would not depict the future at all! If you like the original series, TNG, Voyager, etc, definitely don't expect Picard to be exactly the same because if you do you will be disappointed.

{"title":"The first episode tricked me","review":"I like Patrick Stewart. He is a genius actor. At first I thought it was Star Trek. The first episode tricked me. The special effects are incredible. The acting is good. Mind you I can't believe that the Federation and Star Fleet who represented dignity, freedom, right against evil has turned into this awful group of sadistic liars and bigots. My first review, after the first show was good but not any more. Moreover I find the violence in this show disgusting (The lady that was removing parts from a former borg almost made me puke). I also find the language to be really below the belt. I hope things will improve because I still intend to watch the show for the sake of seeing such a good actor as Patrick Stewart.","rating":"5\/10","date":"22 February 2020"}
{"title":"I thoroughly Enjoyed Picard, Don't Listen to these Fools","review":"Other than the strong language at times which is un-Star Trek like, I thoroughly enjoyed Picard. I liked most of the new characters and liked seeing the familiar ones. It is perfect. No, but I do think it was great story telling, thought provoking with an exciting conclusion. These negative reviews are people stuck in the past. The original Star Trek was in its own era, TNG was another error that brought about changes people hated when it debuted. I think most have forgotten the initial hate it received. Thank God there was no social media and internet haters then or the show might not have lasted, neither DS9 or Voyager.","rating":"10\/10","date":"27 April 2020"}
{"title":"Aimless","review":"What is this show, because it isn't Star Trek? Where is the hope? Where is the progress? This is a crappy Galaxy. Gene wanted us to look toward the future with hope, but the writers took advantage of the whiny, easily offended culture we live in and created this aimless, disjointed, boring sci-fi Star Trek knock off that presents a hopeless, fractured future.\nFan service would have been better than this. Discovery is better, though only slightly.","rating":"5\/10","date":"29 March 2020"}
{"title":"Such negative reviews?","review":"Did StarTrek deliver? They gave us everything we love, great characters that we love, introduced a few new ones! Gave us great story!

{"title":"Finally Star Trek has returned","review":"When they announced Star Trek: Picard, I was really worried and excited at the same time, because would this finally be a return to the real Star Trek of old, or the same drivel as Star Trek: Discovery.\nAfter watching it, I can only say one thing. I was absolutely blown away! The story is like the embodiment of what Gene Roddenberry created, I would say it is the most perfect 10 episodes ever created in a season. Also the story is a great continuance of the last real good Star Trek ever produced, and brings a better closure on the whole Data thing.\nI can't wait for season 2.","rating":"10\/10","date":"11 April 2020"}
{"title":"A Fantastic First Season","review":"It is funny while I have been reviewing plenty of Star Wars products recently I have just finished the first season of Star Trek's new show Picard and here is my review of the show. The premise sees a retired admiral of the Galactic Federation come out of retirement to attempt to save a young android from destruction by a secret Romulan assassination squad.Main Character\nPatrick Stewart is back as Admiral Jean Luc Picard for this show and he does a fantastic job, you can see just how great an actor he still is by his performance on the show. He has so much depth to him as a character and you can't help but be inspired by him and understand why the rest of the cast follow him throughout. He is not just your typical action star and it is nice to see a character with some real depth to him and a really interesting moral compass.Supporting Characters\nAlison Pill plays Dr Jurati and I thought she was a really interesting character among other interesting characters on the show. At first I found her pretty bland and uninteresting but as the show progresses she gets more and more screen time and really has some interesting dilemas that she is put in, she is torn between a few things and it really shows her morality questioned. Isa Briones plays the Android on the show and she is also interesting as you see her questioning everything and you see things through her eyes and how her life gets flipped on its head by the introduction of Picard. Michelle Hurd plays Raffi, a former Starfleet officer that has fallen off the rails and she does a very good job, I thought her and Stewart had really good chemistry on the show and I thought her character goes though quite a bit on the show to make you care about her. Santiago Cabrera plays the pilot Rios and at first I thought he was just going to be a Han Solo ripoff but he gains more character as the show progresses and you grow to like him plus the actor is very charming and charismatic which obviously helps.Story\nAs you can pretty much guess I really liked the crew dynamic on this show and I feel like having a likeable crew really helped making this a good story, I also liked the characters individual story arcs and thought they were really interesting. Also having an interesting moral dilema as the main crux of the stories helps, seeing both sides point of view makes the plot more fascinating to watch. However, I have to say I thought the ending to the season was quite weak, I can't go into details without spoiling it but it does something that takes away from some of the emotional impact of the finale.Script\nThe script is great, the characters feel like real people, there is more humour then I was expecting and for the most part it worked and the drama also felt dramatic which helped make these characters plight be something that we could care about.Style\nThe style has some great action scenes both on the ground and in space, you can tell this show has a big budget to it and it pays off making the show feel very large scale. It also has a great tone mixing the action and story elements that make the 10 episodes feel the right length ais it is never dull.Overall\nOverall, I was so suprised by how much I enjoyed this show. It had some great messages to it and some memorable characters and whether you are a fan of Star Trek or not I believe you will find this show interesting.Rating - 9\/10.","rating":"9\/10","date":"23 December 2021"}
{"title":"The poor reviewers here are living in the past.","review":"Having watched the first three episodes, I'm all in. The story is excellent, as is the acting and cgi. It stays true to the spirit of Star Trek, overcoming prejudices, stereotypes, and exploration, offering insights into our humanity, good and bad, and how we perceive. I have no idea what these 1,2,3 star reviews are thinking, although there is a distinct odor of misogyny and backwards thinking in their reviews. Highly recommend to real fans of Star Trek.","rating":"9\/10","date":"8 February 2020"}

{"title":"Why? Just why? Why does it have to be this way?","review":"Two stars for Patrick Stewart making the best of a bad situation.Star Trek, for me, stopped at Enterprise. Everything after was just a mistake. Some may argue that Enterprise was also a mistake, and I get that, but Enterprise had a couple things that Picard doesn't.1.) Character development and comradery between crew members. In Picard, it seems like every member of the La Sirena crew is just an independent person of no crew on their own mission, with their own agenda, like they only happened to be on the same ship or something. I care for none of the characters, aside from Picard himself. On any other ST show, even Disco, the crew is a family that look out for each other and become friends. The characters are likeable in those shows. STP? Not even close.2.) Dynamic episodes. Throughout the first two seasons, all the episodes with the exception of a couple two-parters were their own unique adventure, with ups and downs along the way. Not every episode ended on a happy note, but unlike Picard, they at least had SOME episodes that ended happily for the crew. Over 50% of the episodes centered on exploration of a new idea or object, with some fun action squeezed in there. In Picard, it's just depressing episode after depressing episode. All sense of wonder is destroyed, and the beginning of Ep.5 really took me completely out of the ST universe. I have never experienced writing as abysmal as this, ever. .You can really feel the 2020 writing in these episodes, and it is awful. Creative decisions? Where? I see none.All creativity seems to have been completely cut off. What was once one of the largest tv franchises in American history has now become a second-rate pay-to-view streaming show, even with the A-listers such as Stewart and Jeri Ryan.Can we talk about Icheb for a second? What was the point of his character arc in Voyager for him to just get randomly murdered? So stupid how this character I really loved, one with a learning arc of redemption from his time as a borg and his journey to self betterment, just gets horribly mutilated and shot at the beginning of the episode. Voyager left a legacy with him, and Picard just threw it away like it was garbage.For all of this, I do not consider Star Trek: Picard canon. STP will NEVER be a part of my canon. My canon ended with Enterprise.To CBS: GET A GRIP NOW. Nobody wants this. If you are going to tell a story with these legendary people, you'd better respect the greats that came before you. You have lost my respect, and by the looks of things, the respect of millions of ST fans.If you're gonna spend millions on a new series, then get Anson Mount, Ethan Peck, and Rebecca Romjin back on screen for a Pike series. Invest in writing that you can expand upon. You have a decade to work with before Kirk takes over as Captain, so add to canon! Seems like such an easy decision to make, that millions of us are willing to pay for. You had an opportunity with Picard, and promptly wasted it.","rating":"2\/10","date":"21 February 2020"}
{"title":"Age irrelevant- a great new beginning.","review":"My first IMDb review....I had to because of some the odd comments on the age of Patrick Stewart. What is the issue with some of you. Life does not stand still, we grow and hopefully mature and maybe even our perspectives on the world changes because of the experiences we have. Don't make age the issue - be it for actor or the character they are portraying. If you want to watch \"Tweeny\" shows there are plenty of those about - especially on Netflix....and don't get me started on some of the comments about the episode focusing more on the female character 1) I didn't notice, 2) So what if they did!As to Picard...... a great first episode. Yes it started with some action and it built well on existing lore and it was great to see the gravitas Stewart brought to the leading role. He and we have the advantage of knowing Picard but how much more watchable is he now 20 years on. I do understand some of the comments that the story may travel contemporary tropes within the genre but it is still only episode one so and even if this is the case if done well it can still be engaging and captivating.As to the production values......on the whole very impressive - hope they keep it up......and for all you cynics......I'm a real individual and not part of some publicity machine.","rating":"9\/10","date":"25 January 2020"}
{"title":"Ignore the Haters","review":"Let me start by Saying. All those People who are Posting dull n boring reviews. It's exactly the Opposite. Personally, I can't stand watching something which is slow and boring. I'll leave the series in the first or second Episode. I've finished all episodes aired so far.

{"title":"Not the Star Trek I was looking for but still great TV","review":"Review up to episode 7I found myself wondering why I'd watched the first two episodes then left it for five weeks to catch up? It wasn't because I hadn't enjoyed episode one and two, I had, I suppose it just didn't grip me enough to sacrifice my gaming time to watch and I was in the middle of watching DS9 Dominion war episodes which I finished yesterday. So, last night and this morning I got myself up to date and here is what I think.This is not the Star Trek I was hoping for but it is the Star Trek I expected. Picard is an old man in his seventies, had he not resigned he would have retired by now, so no seven year voyage of discovery to look forward to. This had to be about a personal journey, a story that could mean something to not only Picard but also to us, the fans. What more noble deed than to save Data's daughter after Data died to save Picard in Nemesis. Incidentally then she could not be data's daughter as Data was dead years before Soji was created, more she was Data's granddaughter, Maddocs created Soji using tech derived from Data from what I can see.So Picard learns about Data's progeny from Soji's sister who very quickly gets killed by the Tal Shiar. We learn throughout the series that the Synths have gone mad, destroyed Mars and through, presumably some vision of the future mind-melded into Aggi via Commodore Oh, will destroy the Earth and trillions will die. That's why the Romulans are hell bent on wiping out all Synths. Obviously this will not be the reality and someone is manipulating everyone else, we'll find out later no doubt.So what do I think? I'm not sure, I can say I am enjoying it and I'm looking forward to Friday and the next episode. Maybe it's easier to say what I didn't like.\nI don't like the dark oppresive future assigned to the Federation, clearly neither does Picard, but the point is it should not be written like that, please don't take away our optimistic future.I don't like some of the silly \"clever\" dialogue, some is so bad I have to put subtitles on to understand what they are saying.I find it silly that the Captain would have to smoke a cigar to look cool hundreds of years after they will have been outlawed.I don't like how characters tend to great each other with weapons drawn and decades of baggage hanging from their shoulders.I don't like this entire thing not being about a Starfleet crew exploring the galaxy, it's more like a futuristic Bourne identity, which in itself is not a bad thing, it's just not Star Trek.I don't like characters using the \"F\" word in Star Trek, ever, it's unnecessary and means I won't be able to watch it with my grand kids when I get some!I despised what happened to Icheb, it was disgusting to watch and to one of my favourite Voyager characters, it was also a total waste of an excellent character who could have joined up with Seven later in the series, graphic torture has no place in Star Trek, for the same reasons the F word does not.I didn't see any reason for Hugh to be killed, although I have a feeling his nanites will save him.I didn't like the hints of an  relationship of Narek and Rizzo, just odd man.Why would the EMH's all look like Rios, seems silly, is the man so narcissistic he needs all of them to look like him?The rest I totally loved and it's what will keep me coming back for more, episode 7 Nepenth, was lovely, seeing Troi, Riker and Picard together again brought tears to my eyes, fantastic chemistry which can never be acted, these people really do love each other in real life and are not acting in these scenes other than the words they say, and that was lovely.Looking forward now to see what happens next and will review again at the end of season 1.","rating":"9\/10","date":"10 March 2020"}

There was only one point preventing me to love it: humanity.\nST:Picard is not about epic fights and heroism, it's about displaying characters. It's the Star Trek I ever wanted, no stereotypes, no good vs evil in an obvious way. It's about characters and character play.If you liked Babylon 5 or if you like The Expanse: This is gold. It's not shiny and flat, it's dark. Characters have their flaws.

{"title":"I thought it was a great show!","review":"Yes... its not your typical star trek, but that was the whole point! Picard had to step down at some point and if you think about it, its practically where Picard was during the TNG series finale. It had to start somewhere and had to start leading somewhere before expanding. People are far too critical of that! If anyone expected this to be another series of galloping around the cosmos having their mission of the week, then you've clearly lost touch with what series seasons are now. 10 to 12 epidodes instead of 23 doesn't give allot of time to go where they used to! If you're critisizing this show after watching only 1 episode or none...then how about actually taking the time to see it start to finish before knocking it! Season 2 should definitely have the show find its stride and pick up the tempo!As far as those of you who seem to think allowing them to curse at long last....get over yourselves! Im not saying they should be swearing like sailors or frequently... but the occaisional colorful comment doesn't hurt anything when the moment calls for it!I did agree with one person comments that it wouldve been great to have them show the federation in shambles after the Dominion War and trying to regain its footing! By doing so granting characters from those series to make pop bys would also have been a great thing! Hopefully thats still a possibility!","rating":"8\/10","date":"15 April 2021"}
{"title":"Great show","review":"A nice little story put together really well. It seems like most of the negative reviews are die hard star trek fans that are upset since this wasn't the reboot they were looking for. Watch it for yourself and form your own opinion. This was a decent form of sci-fi entertainment when compared to most shows now a days. Would have been nice if there was a bit more action as the show can be slow at times. Overall putting the history of Star Trek aside and taking this show for what its worth, I would definitely recommend it.","rating":"9\/10","date":"14 February 2022"}
{"title":"Ignore the haters, this is pure Star Trek","review":"At the end of the day, Star Trek is and always was a morality play examining what it means to be human. This series does that and means it.Picard is exactly who he always was, the pro who took his role seriously and always strived to do the right thing even if it meant bending the rules.This is an extension of that, forcing us to examine our own humanity by challenging us to look past our own prejudices and fears.Is it perfect? Of course not. There were some elements that felt more like they belonged in an episode of a CW series, but they can be forgiven. The things this show gets right simply outweigh the things it doesn't to such an extent those quibbles are ultimately irrelevant.It's a worthy addition to the world of Star Trek, because it's exactly what Star Trek was all about, pushing boundaries and yes, buttons.","rating":"9\/10","date":"30 September 2021"}
{"title":"One of the best Star Trek-series of all time","review":"Season 1I really liked the first season. The story is exciting, the Star Trek feeling is good, there are some nostalgia moments, Picard continues to be great as a character and I find the theme of \"AI\" and \"androids\" in the center super.9\/10 pointsSeason 2The second season unfortunately has a very tough start, because the first five episodes are pretty lame and hardly get going. Then again the journey to the present. I found that a bit uninspired. I did like the fact that Q was there again. In general, there is a lot of nostalgia here, too. But from about the sixth episode on, the season became much better and more exciting. The finale touched me deeply and was really good again. But I still liked season 1 better.8\/10 pointsSeason 3The absolute best season of the series! A lot of nostalgia, a lot of emotions, some great new characters, especially Captain Liam Shaw, who was a real ass in the beginning, won my heart. I also liked Jack Crusher as a multi-layered newcomer. Seeing the whole old crew reunited was the absolute highlight, especially when they bring the old Enterprise 1701-d from Next Generation out of the museum. It was also great that many other old characters from the other series were back. In addition, the best music from the old series wei Next Generation, Voyager and the film First Contact. The finale is the ultimate! Absolutely epic! This ingenious third season alone makes this series \"Picard\" one of the best, if not THE best series there is to Star Trek at all.10\/10 pointsOther comments about the series:By the way, the sound quality of the series is on the highest level. Even for streaming it is almost movie level. Excellent surround simulation, the surround speakers are also used strongly and the action scenes have decent power and precision. Simply outstanding and a pleasure for the ears. With \"The Mandalorian\" they should have taken a leaf out of this book.The picture quality is also very high, as is the CGI quality in space and in the ships and action scenes. Really great!My opinion about the logic problems of the series: I don't find them really dramatic or bad, because logic problems within the Star Trek universe are countless. Every series and every movie had logic problems. I find it wrong to reproach this series, especially since the logic problems are negligible.Overall rating of the series:9\/10 points.","rating":"9\/10","date":"23 April 2023"}

If there was any thread of an engaging narrative here, the writers utterly buried it\nin their headlong rush to be \"clever\" and \"edgy\".This sort of filmmaking seems more and more prevalent these days: Throw some characters into a half-baked, needlessly complicated plot, have them do some incomprehensible stuff to, with, or in spite of each other, add some pricey eye-candy special effects, liberal use of gratuitous violence, some sex - amongst the most unlikely of pairings - that furthers the plot in no discernable way, and call it a day !The body count is large and nobody learned anything. Do we care ?Bonus points for: deep philosophical meanderings that don't go anywhere, any character with an unkempt beard and an annoying accent, bad-guys who are so one dimensional they make Darth Vader seem deep, and anyone with mad sword skillz. Shall we talk about lazy over-reliance on established characters and the actors who portray them, flattening those characters into inconsequential ghosts of themselves ? Please, let's not.Finally, one cannot overlook the tragedy here of some very capable actors, saddled with a shredded pastiche of a story that is by turns confusing (so clever!), overwrought (so edgy!), and cringe-worthy (WTF?). We could get into it here, but frankly, it's just too depressing.Two stars for an intriguing first episode, and then it's mostly downhill from there.","rating":"2\/10","date":"14 April 2020"}

{"title":"For the naysayers","review":"Personally I've been a Star Trek fan for years. Not a buff or boffin on the series but enjoyed all of TNG and Voyager and the original films and series back in the 70's and 80's. Times change. Series change. Actors get older and our lives become more complex. Issues in the world will always influence media whether it be film or news. This series is no different. Personally I've loved every episode. John Luc is much older and more frail. He's been humbled by life. The plot has me intrigued. And the fact that life has taken its tole on him is believable. All other reviewers are slating this series because they want it to be like the old Star Trek. Here's a little heads up. That series finished 26 years ago. You want Sir Patrick to be the old Picard? Seriously? Are you still the same person you were 26 years ago? I for 1 am not. I've been more humbled by life and am more cautious, wiser and settled. Everything evolves and if you can't deal with change and are looking for modern day nostalgia this may not give you your fix. I am enjoying this series. New characters, new plots, Picard is not infallible, old characters returning it's good. Have an open mind and you'll enjoy this.","rating":"8\/10","date":"16 February 2020"}
{"title":"Soo soo soo soo bad. Whoever wrote the women characters should be summarily fired.","review":"I signed up specifically to rate this a 1. I never leave reviews, but Picard was such a disappointment I had to make myself heard here in my little-man-with-his-little-rage kinda way.The only, and I mean only, saving grace of this is that we get to see some of the original cast again, and they do as well as they can with the material. The new characters are immediately forgettable. The women are so badly written it's painful to watch. As the series drew on toward the end, I found myself with a perma-frown so intense, my frowny muscles ached for a day afterward. The dialogue is stilted, the politics of the writers shines through clearly as they have their little actor puppets dodder around championing their social justicey snark. Others have said it already, but it's just bad on about every level. There is no intelligent conversation, no real exploration of new themes and moral conundrums, just a plot staggering from one returning original cast member to another, and a crew that cringy, bad guys who are cringy, sex, language, graphic violence.. just not Trek in my book.I've watched the TNG series 3 times through, DS9 twice, TOS, Voyager, etc. Haven't been inclined to try Discovery, and given the parallels drawn from those who've seen Picard and Discovery, I won't be wasting my time.I hope enough people speak up about what Trek is becoming that it'll make a difference, but I fear it won't.","rating":"1\/10","date":"24 April 2020"}

A character driven story with heart, morality, intelligence and action embedded all of the items that make up a great Star Trek series. Finally someone at CBS understands how to produce real Star Trek. I have watched this episode over 20 times since 03:01am ET.

{"title":"Star Trek: Discard","review":"Discard your hope and expectation for this to be a good Star Trek series, let alone welcoming back one of the best starship captains in the Sci-Fi universe. This is a Picard who has become an activist of some sort, inconsistent in his behaviors and lacking the growth or wisdom that has distinguished him as a beloved character we knew.Instead we have an uneven series with a hollow of a man named Picard, surrounded by a ragtag band of uninteresting and out of place new characters (in the form of his new crew and villains). I'd say his Romulan caretakers and maybe Captain Rios have potential, but they were hardly developed nor explored in the series. Instead we have a highly unstable Dr Agnes who seems better suited to be in Sabrina or other teenage series for girls, a caricature of a Wuxia warrior in Elnor and the incoherent Raffi whose preference to call Picard 'JL', made me want to vomit every time I heard it.The entire universe feels off and has the outer appearance of Star Trek but ignores all the rules and logic that shape that universe. Federation people swearing like rap artists, humans still live in poverty, smoking and taking drugs, Starfleet led by foul mouthed and angry xenophobes - this is not the Gene Roddenberry's vision of the 24th century.In fact, the dialogue and characterization are so juvenile that at times I thought I was watching a CW melodrama. Instead of that optimistic spirit and unity in the face of adversity and conflicts from the old series we've come to love, we now have literally dark show that is obsessed with close-ups, lens flare and torture scenes. Who are producing and writing these garbage?What a shame and a missed opportunity, they should really think about getting genuine Trek writers if they want to win the fans back for Season 2. Three points for Seven of Nine and seeing old faces like Hugh, Riker, Troi and Data.I won't be watching Season 2, and will be keeping to The Orville, thank you very much.","rating":"3\/10","date":"4 April 2020"}
{"title":"Amazing Series!","review":"Having just finished the season, I can say this is the best thing to come out of the Star Trek franchise. I've long been a fan of the original series, probably because I spent so much of my early years watching syndicated reruns on TV. While I enjoyed Next Generation at the time it aired, I've found it difficult to return to it because it's so saccharin. This show is not that. It feels more like a novel. TNG each episode stood on its own. This series tells a story. The format should be familiar to everyone since all the best modern shows are doing this now. The pacing is slower but in a really good way. The characters are not one dimensional. Everyone has flaws in a way that makes more human, more believable. This helps is presenting the questions of what does it mean to be alive, to be real. Even \"the bad guys\" are driven be motivations that seem logical and reasonable from their perspective. I can't stand stories where the bad guys are just plain evil. Everyone thinks that what they are doing is right (unless they're sociopaths). There's a lot of things that should please old Trekkies yet sophisticated enough for a modern audience. There's a lot of undeserved bad reviews for this show that I suspect are mostly written by the same person or small group of people with multiple accounts. It's really a very good show. Definitely raises the bar for Star Trek MUCH better than ANY of the reboot movies!","rating":"10\/10","date":"6 April 2020"}

{"title":"Loved it.","review":"This show looks GORGEOUS. But much more importantly, it's beautiful storytelling. I was a huge fan of the original Star Trek and only watched TNG through once. I liked it, but didn't know how I would feel about this show since it was never my favorite. But then the first episode sucked me right in and I binged the whole thing. I even found myself crying during the season 1 finale. It moved me to tears. This is SciFi at its absolute best: posing big questions about human life and our place in the universe. What constitutes life, are some lives worth saving more than others, and what should we decide to do with the precious gift of life? What is the responsibility of organizations like Starfleet in thag respect? And what is our responsibility as individuals when those organizations fail? I can't say enough good things about this show. Watch it.","rating":"10\/10","date":"31 March 2020"}
{"title":"Still waiting for \"Star Trek\" to return....","review":"I just finished watching Season 1 last night, and after reading several of the other comments on this site, i am in agreement with many others.\nWhen i was growing up, Star Trek The Next Generation was more than just a TV show to me, it was and has always been my moral compass throughout life. I have listened to the uncensored audio book about the history of Star Trek many times so i do understand what people said about Gene Roddenberry, i very much looked up to him when i was young, and as an adult, i understand that he was subject to the human condition. But he did something very few other people have done, he gave us a positive outlook on life, he showed us that we are not hell bent on destroying ourselves and that we can one day travel to places that we can only now imagine. I saw those lessons very much in TNG. Every episode had some lesson to teach and i founded my moral ground on that show.\nI am not saying that this new show does not have some lesson to teach, but i believe the whole franchise has drifted away from what Roddenberry intended. I realize that story arcs are a common factor in todays shows, but the appeal of TNG was that every week we had some new adventure to go on, you could sit down for 45+ minutes, watch an episode, take in not only the action and adventure, but the message that most of the episodes delivered, and you could get up and feel a little better about yourself. That feeling gets lost easily in story arcing. It took me all 10 episodes to find a message from this show.\nI also loved Star Wars as a kid as well, but Lucas dropped the ball when he handed his creation to Disney, and they destroyed it.My suggestion for the creators of this show.. sit down and take a good long look at what made TNG popular. Look at what made Star Trek in general popular. I am sure there are many many many others that think as i do about Star Trek. Your audience has not changed after all these years, and i dont mean the die hard trekkers, i am talking about the newest generations that get lost in shoot-em up video games, and watching people play video games on YouTube. One day i will attempt to get my children to watch the original, TNG, DS9, VOY, and ENT so they can have available to them, the experience i had, but these new shows are YOUR chance to deliver that experience on a updated scale. Try not to drop the scale!.","rating":"3\/10","date":"15 April 2020"}

I cannot be described as a die hard fan but I do appreciate them.The other reviews seem to be quite polarised, it's a love or hate thing.I would say that most sane people would accept that the look and feel of this series has changed from TNG, there again special effects and production values have also moved on. Does the fact that it's filmed more a like film rather than a TV show put me off? Not at all.If you are a die hard fan of TNG then you will probably dislike it purely because it's not TNG, nothing is going to appease you anyway.

{"title":"To Boldly Go No Where","review":"Me and my wife are giving this 2 stars, one for Sir Pat and one for commiserations to all Star Trek fans; who have to continue to watch CBS march their beloved franchise into a grave.I can accept that this is 2020 and not 1987. I don't expect this series to feel, look or necessarily bare much resemblance to TNG, but I don't think It's too much to ask for something that feels like a natural continuation. The choices here baffle me - The federation has abandoned its principals, Jean Luc has been embittered and done little but pick grapes with Irish Romulans for a decade and a half. The Gene Roddenberry utopia that was the basis of Star Trek is now an Alex Kurtzman nightmare.Why would anyone choose to revive a beloved series only to make something that barely resembles it? Let's use a breakfast analogy: You wouldn't try to make an omelette without eggs would you? Or ask someone that's never made an omelette before to make 16 of them? Or worse, serve cereal and tell the customer that ordered omelette that in fact, their cereal is an omelette?!? This kind of gets to the heart of my confusion with 'Picard'. Are they trying to force a new recipe on me? Did they not understand what it was they were making? Or are the people behind it so arrogant they felt they had a better idea of what to do and ignore what came before? Whichever one of these is closest to the truth, the results are... disappointing.The dialogue ranges from sloppy to bizarre, the pacing is slow and the design is ugly. Costume detailing is horrible and the technology is equally upsetting, even implausible. I will however praise the acting because they do great work with awful writing.If like me you are a Star Trek fan you will almost certainly be disappointed. Such a wasted opportunity makes me sad. How could they get it so wrong? Try not to be too upset, the good ones are on Netflix whenever you want them.

But it has enough fan service for me to be entertained and reminisce of my childhoods' favorite Sci-Fi show.\nI understand being angry at this show for not being an exact replica of TNG, but I'm pretty sure if it was it would have had similar results, because the approach on drama in movies and TV series has changed and this show reflects that to some degree.\nIn the end I would say, if you're a hardcore fan of TNG or just Star Trek in general (I am a big fan, but not hardcore), and are not able to set your fanboy opinions aside and just keep an open mind, it's probably best you skip this one.\nThere's only one review here that I agreed with that had a 1 star rating, but very good points on all the flaws of this show, but that to me was contradicting. All the points made would probably give this at least 5 stars, but deliberately give it a 1 star shows that fanboy disappointment I was talking about earlier.\nAnyway, if you have a few hours to kill and are a fan of TNG, give it a watch (all of season 1) and then decide weather you want to keep watching future seasons or not.

This is a drawn out adventure of a famous starship captain and his last hoorah before his end. Picard is now an old man full of regrets and looking to make atonement for his perceived mistakes.Remember in the older series random episodes where an older retired star ship captains or even Klingons come on the star ship with an ulterior motive? Where they try sneak in one last adventure before they die? This is picards last big adventure.Also, the other series weren't as violent or vulgar bc when they were made tv didn't permit that kind of imagery or language. The show has to stay up with modern times to adapt to new audiences, connect to them. I think the show still held onto the essence of Star Trek. Some of the fight scenes were awesome too.

I think everyone needs to re-watch these episodes, give it a chance and let the scenes grow on you. So now I have a question that plagues me more than the BORG. You see we all grew up thinking the BORG is the greatest threat of all living things, then this TV series made us hate the Romulans even more because they started hating our favorite character's daughter. We couldn't have that so we gave this a one star review as revenge to the Romulans.... That doesn't make any sense at all? We are dealing with emotionally unstable adolescents 50 year old children that get emotional if the script gets twisted on them too much.Like I said let the script grow on you. Their is something out their way worst than the Borg. The Tal Shiar's call them \" The Admonition\" Well whatever they are they seem to be the destroyer of all life and they are unreasonable. Possibly they may live in peace somewhere on a planet without those crazy tentacle things and that is where my questions comes.Will the next few seasons be about Pickard as a Synth traveling like NEO from the MATRIX!

If old fans dont like it it is perfectly normal. it is clear the writers didnt want to make another installation of the classical ST setup, it had to speak to the new star trek fans, like me. this series shows how the renaissance of TNG is over, how the federation has failed its principles even after the war with the romulans was won. it gives a better ending to the arc of the best characters even if some are missing (and i guess they will appear in the next season, im talking to you LaForge, Worf, Doctorn Crusher, where the hell are you guys? and also Mr Crusher, im sure new installment will complete his super natural arc, if the actor is still alive, Q, i miss you). i saw this show and felt the need to see TNG, the original series, all the movies (which are mostly crap except for the one with kirk) i guess it was well designed then. if old \"customers\" of ST didnt like it is because once again they wanted TNG s8e1, which will not happen because the 90s are over.","rating":"8\/10","date":"12 September 2020"}
{"title":"Language","review":"I could forgive the terrible directing and watch just because it is Star Trek, unlike discovery which is beyond hope, but the language it horrific. Every other word curses out God. This is not Star Trek which used to be a family show and even if you are not religious, what kind of person lets their kids listen to such vulgar. Growing up my family would sit and watch all the Star Trek next generation series and we watched the original series repeats. We watched Voyager and all the Star Trek movies and this is without a doubt one of the filthiest shows I've seen. If you don't have the talent to produce a show without vulgar get out of the directing business.","rating":"1\/10","date":"8 January 2023"}

Ohh I don't know, maybe it's because stupid people like all these people crying \"this is not Star Trek\" You have got to be freaking kidding me!!!!! Just because you watched Star Trek when you were a kid, that doesn't mean you are an expert. Just because Star Trek inspired you doesn't mean you're not stupid.

{"title":"Painfully Inarticulate","review":"The idea of an extremely vulnerable geriatric character, Jean-Luc Picard would somehow be a leading focal point in this seemingly poorly implemented, portrayed and scripted series, it quickly became quite evident this highly anticipated series was absolutely unwatchable after only 3 to 4 episodes. While I've always enjoyed Sir Patrick Stewart's presence in Next Generation and in subsequent related films, as well as on stage, something was very much amiss in this series. Whether being attributable to its apparent minimal overarching budget, minimalistic production values, poor scripting and direction, none of it appealed to me and if anything, I found it entirely underwhelming, annoying. To say this was disappointing would be an understatement.","rating":"3\/10","date":"7 March 2021"}
{"title":"Decent Start to the Series","review":"My first impressions are that it felt familiar, comfortable and great seeing Patrick Stewart as Picard again. Overall I liked the intro to the seasons mystery and plotline, however disliked some of the shortcuts they took with the story, star trek cannon and visuals.For instance the use of older (Discovery era) shuttle and technology models instead of using at a minimum TNG models. The fact that Picard focused almost immediately in on a very plain necklace to unlock key elements of the story, commenting that it was very unusual when it really wasn't. Also the fact they completely threw out the direction the federation was going with vying for peace and cooperation with the romulans during the Nemesis movie.So overall liked the beginning, but am hoping for more continuity and attention to cannon.","rating":"8\/10","date":"26 January 2020"}

{"title":"Fantastic Sequel","review":"Never mind the inevitable whining of self-proclaimed Trekkies (actually I'm one of them, but I like change, when it's good), Star Trek: Picard is an excellent, well produced, psychologically mature, and sophisticated Star Trek sequel, and a natural continuation of the life of a retired Star Fleet legend. The spirit of the series is not only perfectly preserved - a rare thing indeed - but the ideas, storytelling, camera work, and CGI have evolved and advanced, positively. Dialogue is at times highly intellectual, aimed more definitely at an educated adult audience - something I really appreciated. And themes and characters, so familiar to any Trekkie, are delicately and delightfully woven into the story as it progresses.\nWhile I could offer many more compliments to all involved in the production, I'm not blind to the few faults it does have. The dialogue and performance by one actress in particular are more akin to a b-grade soapie. It's a real pity, but thankfully these scenes are few and far between (and I think she gets wiped out eventually) and didn't detract in any significant way from my complete absorption in and enjoyment of this fabulous experience.","rating":"9\/10","date":"26 March 2020"}

{"title":"Permanent Stain","review":"Season one had a strong opening but declined heavily over its run. There was some merit and solace to found in the Data plotline, but otherwise a weak departure from the heart and soul of the Star Trek philosophy and universe.Season two is an abomination from the outset. A clear example of storytelling by committee. Poor decisions throughout. Kindergarten levels of writing and plotting, obvious exposition, gaping plot holes and disgustingly irritating characters. Even poor Patrick Stewart comes across as an bungling amateur having little direction and a shockingly underdeveloped script.Ultimately, Picard has become a viscous stain on the Star Trek franchise and tarnishes the legacy of what was always an incredibly well conceived, written, philosophised and executed show.To sum up in a base, colloquial, language the many many producers of this show might just understand:\nOS, TNG, DS9, Voyager, even Enterprise - Picard and it's committee defecate upon you. Live Long and Prosper.","rating":"3\/10","date":"2 April 2022"}

{"title":"There's a real story here","review":"I expected alot worse after recent star trek outings. But this show got me in the first 30 seconds. I'll admit I'm a Trekkie of old.This show isn't like ST:D which is fast paced and makes very little sense. It is a fast paced show and so far my old turtle brain is able to make out the connections from scene to scene. But they're really pushing it though. I think they've deliberately gone away from the pacing of ST:TNG and the Orville. Let's hope the writing keeps up with the pace.This is show isn't like ST:D which is overly manipulative and wants to tell you exactly how you should feel about every scene and every character. This show doesn't have mountains of exposition from characters we have no connection too which always frame the scene. This show has amazing writers!So far the writers on this show haven't debased good actors by making them brag about defcon level .The special effects and cinematics on the other hand are just as good as ST:D. The new art and aesthetics that the JJ Trek universe look beautiful in the twilight of the 24th century and match perfectly. The beauty and modernity of the set design unfortunately threw me off a bit when watching ST:D, which was no fault of the artists and set designers.They've written a story about the connection that Data has to Picard and how Picard will do anything to protect that connection.We care about these characters and we are not being lectured by the director or the writers on how to care.I love it. Please keep writing!","rating":"10\/10","date":"25 January 2020"}

{"title":"Finally!!","review":"As a person who enjoys good TV shows this is one! I don't enjoy the \"sex\" aspect of tv nowadays. I want to be intrigued by the storyline. The telling of how it started, why we are where we are, how we got to where we are. So many shows today start with a story then add sex thinking some viewers only enjoy the story when people are getting naked. No thank you.Now we start where the movie ended. 14 years earlier a war happened. Picard tried to help only to be stripped of his title. Androids started the war and therefore wiped out. Data was deconstructed, but his \"daughter\" survived. The Ramulens sneaky people have a secret group lurking around and try to destroy the \"copy\".Picard makes it his mission to help his dead friends daughter survive.If you hate the \"sex\" aspect of shows, yet enjoy a good watch.

When I heard it was coming, I thought cool, it will be on SYFY which is now SIFI, which is now mostly junk. They spend too much time on Sharkando movies and not enough on actual Science Fiction, which is where they started. Anyway, it didn't end up on SIFI, I don't know where it ended up, it's not on Netflix (which from the reviews even they wouldn't touch it apparently). It.s not on Hulu. I have to buy a special channel to watch this ONE show, that I'm glad I didn't now. The last good thing Patrick Stewart was in was Logan or a Christmas Carol.

{"title":"It starts strong...","review":"Goes downhill very fast. By episode 5 it was over. You knew there was no salvaging the series as it turned into a mopey dopey teenage style drama with cringe worthy interpersonal dialog, none of it interesting to a Trekkie.The actions of everyone in the show is driven by emotions like a bunch of grade schoolers. There is also a decided lack of science and tech. Plenty of CGI but no new ideas or theories and certainly no exploration. They did add more action but thats it.All in all, this is not Star Trek. This is more like a teenage vampire drama like Buffy without the campy edge. Watch the Orville instead.

If your a trek fan esp TNG you would vote it favourable even if bad, and its not. After all this is Picard and hes back. You give it **** and you get that back. Would you rather nothing or another reboot?So much i loved about the show already. Its setting up a good story with tons of nostalgic look backs that don't hang it back but push forward to a new frontier of strong character building that the TNG began. Cant wait for the next one.There was odd moments were the timeline of events had one character appear from one scene to the next without any explanation.

Not as bad as Discovery but Picard also just didn't feel like a Start Trek series. It doesn't have the right DNA. It's kinda slow and boring also. I'm really wondering why they always have to reinvent the wheel. Why not just stick to your guns and make an updated TNG. We'll never know.","rating":"4\/10","date":"1 April 2020"}

{"title":"Picard: series 1 and only (for me probably)","review":"Its difficult to believe that such a shambles made it to TV, well streaming, as this is clearly a butchered production, botched and bodged, despite the blather and bluster from persons involved in it's creation.'Star Trek: Picard' series 1 certainly moved things forwards. Well, actually, it didn't did it? I mean, in effect the entire series has taken us nowhere except to introduce an uninteresting cast of teenagers in adult clothing who are, as of now, utterly insignificant outside of the story we have just witnessed.Except Picard, who has completed a rejuvenation, a renaissance, a recovery and rediscovery of his equilibrium that nobody knew he needed, or would need, based on our previous experiences with him. Literally including a rebuilding of his physical body at the conclusion of the series and a rebirth into it from an \"almost death\" experience.This journey is silly and unnecessary and serves to effectively reset the series' protagonist from a problem that only exists at the behest of the show runners. How uninteresting for the rest of us.For me, this theme, that Picard is deeply emotionally unwell and damaged as well as suffering a neurological condition, was not an unworthy idea for a way of reintroducing Jean-Luc Picard but it was not at all a definite necessity for the character and therefore the quality of the execution would decide on the merit of this approach. Sadly there was precious little merit in the execution of this theme.It also involved the entangling of barmy and bizarre features of Data's \"deaths\" as well as associated artificially created life with the life of Picard in a manner that obscured more than it revealed and disassociated this new look at Picard from the memory of his prior existence far more than it served to place him into a new and convincing context as shown in this series.Overall this seemed over-written, overwrought and overcooked whilst denying the rest of the series any genuine forward momentum and bogging Jean-Luc Picard down in dreary and dissolute morbidity.Meanwhile this narrative theme was mixed with a mythological, mythic and fantasy element to expand the scope of the story and fill the runtime of the series.Told in a serialised style the overall effect on establishing a context for this series was disastrous: in effect the rules of mythical storytelling have brought everything back to where they began for everybody in this universe other than the immediate players in the quest-saga.Along with the reset effect on Picard's character and the minimally developed supporting cast of characters one could very easily bypass this series and go into series two; if there will be a series 2.Everything happening in this series has been solely at the behest of the writers: there was no need for Picard to have the journey that he did, no need for the Romulans, no need for the Synths, no need for Picard's assorted helpers etc, from any prior established feature of the Star Trek franchise; and now that they have resolved their own themes at series end, well frankly, you can bypass this entirely.All together the first series of 'Star Trek: Picard' is highly \"miss-able\" entertainment. If you wanted, just watch episodes 1-2 and 9-10 and you will get it.I deeply regret both the broad and detailed implications of the showrunners decision to utilise mythic story forms in this series.Mythological storytelling is based on fundamental human urges and drives, but because people never fundamentally change, this leads to prescriptive and rigid story forms. Exactly the underlying problem, exacerbated by an insistence on a serialised narrative structure, that this series has experienced.In sci-fi, Science Fiction, the entire point is that anything is possible, nothing is set, everything has a how and a why: understand it and you can change it. There is no destiny justified within a sci-fi context. Only the limitations of human imagination. Nothing else.The exact opposite of mythic storytelling.With Star Trek, particularly the TV Star Trek form associated with Jean-Luc Picard this is emphasised by the highly optimistic and open-mindedness of it's original formulation: humanity has progressed beyond what we are now.....so what imaginations will these people have in 300 years time!!I personally know nothing interesting or entertaining about the Star Trek world 20 years after I last saw it, except that Riker and Troi had a family, had their ups and downs lived life and have a healthy daughter together, thats pretty much it.I have to wonder at the point of the continuation of the entire franchise at this point; if the people who own and make commercial decisions about Star Trek, and the people who produce and make the creative decisions about Star Trek, and the people who consume and decide if they like Star Trek are not able to line up in any agreeable \"direct line of sight\" then what's the point?","rating":"3\/10","date":"29 March 2020"}

Talking about answers, you get answers throuh out The season maybe not all but enough to get you satisfied. This is written before season 3 after season 2 and I really hope season 3 will be good as I felt really forfilled after season 2 and was surprised when I heard about a season 3.

The Easter eggs have been amazing, from referencing old episodes to the soundtrack which includes nods to TNG and Star Trek: First Contact. The best film with the TNG crew. I can't wait to watch the rest of the season. So psyched! I hope there is a spinoff for one of the characters from TNG or a whole new series set during this time period with a new ship and new crew.

I only managed to slog through a half dozen episodes in Season 1 and even fewer in Season 2. My rating for those earlier seasons would be a 4 or 5.The latest storyline is partially rooted in Picard's history in STNG, and it looks like a number of those characters from the past are turning up. This reworked series is clearly a rescue operation and it does succeeds. It is well worth watching as it's true Star Trek fare and good entertainment.Hopefully the good news about this latest season will reach the many disappointed fans so that Picard will have a shot at doing number 4.","rating":"9\/10","date":"24 April 2023"}
{"title":"Sorry; this is not Star Trek. Gene Roddenberry is turning in his grave.","review":"I have watched every incarnation of Star Trek including the original series when I was about 12 or 13 years old. Star Trek: Picard is not the Star Trek I grew up with and have enjoyed as an adult. I always liked ST for its positive outlook to the future of humanity. It represented a time where we had calmed climate change, we had long past attained true peace on our planet, become a space faring species and had made alliances with other intelligent beings in the galaxy. I was also proud of the fact that Star Fleet Headquarters was based in San Francisco, the city of my birth.ST: Picard is far too violent and dark. What a sad loss and end of an era of ST as a reinforcing, encouraging and positive form of sci-fi that depicted believable human future.I agree with most of the other negative reviews of this latest series. It truly saddens me to see the writers take ST in this new, dark dystopian direction.","rating":"1\/10","date":"9 May 2020"}

It closes another chapter, but will there be an offspring?The vision of creator Gene Roddenberry expanded all of our visions with the dream of space travel. The characters that were the cosmic children of Mr Roddenberry gave us an insight to what may be. We were introduced to Vulcans, Klingons, Romulans and the Ferengi.

{"title":"Season 3 Review","review":"I've always thought Season 1 was ok, didn't know what the complaint from many were about. I thought they were just being nostalgic. However, Season 2 was a wreck and after 2-3 episodes I just gave up this series.Season 3 was an absolutely surprise. It was utterly perfect in the writing and acting, it blew me away. It was engaging and there are character development. It restored much of the old values and themes of the TNG days and filled with great lessons of morality, selflessness, humility, courage, respect, and even understanding we need to control our emotions and learn to be calm, patient, wise, and ... hopeful.But aside from that, there's even a hint of a very specific theme. From the start, I felt it was taking the theme from what is happening in this nation, where our whole government was infiltrated by the enemy to the highest level and most people aren't even aware of it. Everyone became distrustful of each other.The last few episodes was just amazing, the commentary on the problem and direction of our society. That everyone under the age of 25 was being assimilated, brainwashed, into a Borg collective, which was essentially a communist authoritarian regime. And this Borg virus does not affect older people above 25. Sounds familiar?","rating":"10\/10","date":"17 May 2023"}
{"title":"Why the negative reviews? Amazing show!!!","review":"Please watch it and cherish every second. This show is a gift. All of you that left awful reviews are ungrateful Trekkies. I too have grown up watching all things Star Trek and I love TNG most of all. To see Sir Pat again as Picard after he said he was finished is something we should all be applauding to keep star trek going (also because the show is enjoyable). If you were true fans and watched The Ready Room with Will Wheaton, you would know that Sir Pat turned this project down over and over again. He didn't want it too look anything like TNG and it is fresh and inspiring for the franchise.\nIt is also an interesting take on the Romulans and Borg. I read several reviews about bad writing, but the story is so creative at every level. Shame on all of you during a time like this. The world needs Star Trek forever and we should be praising this show and the newness it brings. Seeing Picard, Data, Riker and Troi again warmed my heart and it made me smile so much. I never thought it would happen. All of you anti-fans need to change your reviews and give this show the proper review it deserves. TNG wasn't perfect at first and we all stuck with it to watch it grow into an amazing show. Picard has great new characters and is trying to meld together all that has happened in the Star Trek Universe. You guys are so picky with your ridiculous comments. It is a tv show made for our enjoyment and it was entertaining with really good special effects. No wonder the world is in shambles...it is because of people like you ripping apart a good show that only deserves high marks from fans. I am starting to think the bad reviews are from people that are not Star Trek fans at all and are trying to sabotage the franchise. On behalf of true Star Trek Fans every where, thank you to everyone involved for bringing us this show and I personally cannot wait for season two! Make it so.","rating":"10\/10","date":"28 June 2020"}

{"title":"Genuinely sad for the franchise.","review":"It seems to have been made by people who have never watched star trek. I hope season 2 brings the franchise back to its roots, they should take a look at cobra kai to see that original material can save any franchise.. This isn't trying to be star trek, its like they've assumed every trek fan is dead and they need new fans.. A real slap in the face for the fans and gene! They need to sack the current writers and bring in more fans and original cast and make season 2 the star trek we all deserve. Nothing about this resembles star trek! A real waste of talent considering they've got so many original cast to take part and yet make them all forget about the characters they'd played for so long. You have Voyager, TNG and DP9 to work with and they've gone away from all that to appeal to God only knows who.. If they carry on down this path they'll kill the franchise completely.","rating":"5\/10","date":"13 March 2021"}
{"title":"Ignore the hate (NO SPOILERS)","review":"I won't add any spoilers.The naysayers here all have three themes. Either \"It's too different\", \"it's not real Star Trek\" or \"It's just a way to make money!\".To them I say ...yes! You are absolutely right on all counts! But why is that bad?It's too different, you say? What's wrong with different? Different is good.If that's your problem, then go watch the originals! Those will never change. That's a simple fix. After all, everything you watch is different. You're looking for familiar, and comfortable. I'm afraid nothing will change your mind.It's not real Star Trek? I know this is just another way of saying \"It's too different\" but I'll address it anyway.What makes it \"real\" Star Trek? Jonathan Frakes directed a few episodes, Patrick Stewart is the star in each one, there are call backs to previous characters, episodes, and plots. It's Star Trek. It's real Star Trek. If you had said \"This isn't Pokemon\", then you would have a valid (yet insane) argument.Now, no, it's not episodic. It's one long serialized episode. So you need to watch them in order, starting from number 1. Personally, I don't know why anyone has a problem with that. It allows for more detail on a given story unlike older Trek where character development required episodes dedicated to that on their own, and sometimes resulted in a rather uninteresting and very skippable episode.Finaly, a simple answer to the \"It's a cash grab\" crowd. Read this carefully now:\"IT IS MEANT TO MAKE MONEY!! IT IS A PRODUCT!!\" TV shows are not free to make, actors are not free...you get me?There are many other arguments, but when you read them, read them carefully. I even read one review that said \"They only added so-and-so to advance the plot\", you are reading the words of someone who does not know how stories work. The naysayers are simply wrong. The story is enjoyable, the casting is brilliant, there's enough humor, action, heart, and social commentary that it feels like Trek. If you disagree, then fine. Disagree. You're wrong, but feel free to be wrong.","rating":"10\/10","date":"5 April 2020"}

{"title":"Blown away","review":"I grew up as a kid in the early to mid 70s being a huge Star Trek fan, in Canada before the time when we got American TV shows here, Star Trek re-runs on Saturday morning on CBC were a very big deal to me.I dutifully watched the Next Generation, but never overly enjoyed it, and only watched the first two cinematic outings (Wrath of Khan has held up surprisingly well I think). I'm just trying to make the point, though I'm pretty fanatical about the original series, I've never watched anything outside TNG, and the two JJ Abrams Star Trek movies other than the first two years ago, so far from a fanatic, or maybe even a fan. I like my sci-fi more in The Foundation or Dune sort of way, or grand space opera a la E. E. \"Doc\" Smith.But this pilot really grabbed me somewhere inside and yanked hard, I was taken out of my little life with it's little problems that can seem oh-so big sometimes, just like on those Saturday morning so long ago. I can hardly believe I'm giving any sort of science fiction work a 9\/10, but I liked it *that* much.

{"title":"Great Star Trek - Back to Basics","review":"So here I am back defending a new Star Trek series, because apparently everything new now offends Trekkies, for some reason. People bashed Discovery, and are now bashing Picard.\nIt follows the TNG timeline very well, and doesn't seem to adopt the reboot timeline (no rogue, deranged, time traveling Romulans this time, even though Romulus blew up).\nYou get all the goodies from TNG, including a few characters from other series. You also get heart, tears, compassion, food for thought, and actually some interesting action. You also get lens flares, but hey, we should be used to them by now.\nSo, if you like Star Trek, again, watch it. If you liked TNG, watch it and prepare to suffer.\nMy captain is back, now an admiral, and it's great. I just don't get why Trekkies are becoming such snobs. Nothing seems to please, because it's different in this way or that way, saying Roddenberry would turn on his grave. The guy who green lighted and produced TOS, TNG, Voyager, DS9 didn't want different approaches to the series. Sure...","rating":"10\/10","date":"2 May 2020"}

The Orville, a Star Trek parody, looks more like a Star Trek show in 2020 than this!To top it off, Starfleet has turned into an autocratic, morally corrupt organization.Star Trek Picard is possibly even worse than Star Trek Discovery, which butchered the Klingons.

If the first episode had an interesting plot, the rest of the episodes are simply very boring. We are just watching a boring and long journey.

{"title":"Not exactly the Star trek you're hoping it will be","review":"Upon watching the first five episodes I was starting to get bored with the lack of actual entertainment factor. However the storyline itself explains quite a bit that had been missing from the original Star trek next episode 5 started to clear things up episode 6 cleared things upepisode 5 started to clear things up episode 6 cleared things up even more and started getting more action episode 7 introduces even more characters from The next generation which I believe play a crucial role in the success of the next generation series. I'm giving this a 9 out of 10 Stars because I have always loved the diversity and the outside the box thinking that the writers have used and it's this type of thinking that enables us as human beings to move forward as a whole. The way certain episodes of this new series tie in to that of the next generation I feel was brilliantly done. In fact I found myself re-watching the original series of next generation from episode 1 all the way through so that I could re-familiarize myself with all of the references such as the painting that lieutenant Commander data had painted of soji\/dahj. and the Borg Hugh. It appears as though they have cleverly taken bits and pieces of individual next generation episodes and have tie them all together and what I see as a form of writing brilliance. As I said before the first few episodes are kind of weak but it does get stronger and I am looking forward to the future episodes. I do highly recommend that you watch the next generation episodes just prior to watching this as you will understand it much better once you have re-watched TNG.","rating":"9\/10","date":"5 March 2020"}

I see fan bouy reviews on both of these creations and I have a singular thought. Is the youth of this century so myopic that they require Doom, Mech Warrior, and Elder-scrolls rolled into every extension of this franchise. They do exceptional work in creating these toys for your mind but it seems unfortunate your mind fail to comprehend. BTW Piccard is better than Discovery but both superior to previous renditions of the Mech-War structure. Wake up as you have no resistance as it is futile... .) Another suggestion forget the previous renderings... sit back and enjoy the new story...I watched these presentation years before most of you were created and today I am amazed at the efforts and script creation to treat your \"MINDS ??\" to something new.

I can honestly say I've watched every show and movie ever developed in the series and while these new series (Discovery and Picard) are vastly different from the shows we grew up loving, i have enjoyed then nonetheless. I will admit that I haven't delved into the cannon books of Star Trek, which may have changed my opinion on the direction they choose to take (such as it did with Disney's Star Wars). In my opinion though, the final episode of season one alone is worth watching this slow starting series and was a true testament to the character of Picard we all enjoyed in years past.","rating":"10\/10","date":"27 March 2020"}

Loved the visit to Nepenthe, especially JLP's reunion with Troi and Will.The desire to eliminate those who are different isn't a new problem. We face it every day. Hatred is hatred and remains so in this world.Sir Patrick plays JLP as a man who has aged and grown weary which is appropriate for the character. He's not quite the same as he was when he commanded the Enterprise. Who is the same after the passage of thirty years?I know I'm not.Superb show.","rating":"8\/10","date":"4 June 2023"}

But here we are. After two rather mediocre seasons (at best) the third installment of Star Trek: Picard finally delivers, assembling all beloved characters from ST:TNG - and more. Moreover, the actors deliver - the veterans with a revived passion for the ST universe and the newjoiners - the new new generation if you like - show off some pretty decent chops and charisma as well. And finally also the writers found a way to reconnect with former and almost forgotten esprit.Overall, I would rate the seasons with 7, 6 and 10 stars respectively, which would add up to a fair 8 on average.","rating":"8\/10","date":"22 May 2023"}

{"title":"Farewell","review":"Nemesis was rough but watchable. The major disappointment with that film was that it was the last one planned. And the show wouldn't be on its on terms. This egregious error was rectified with this series. The 2nd season was a bit tedious at times because Picard's backstory was a constant replaying of the same stuff but it introduced some interesting characters and said goodbye to some others. But the 3rd season! The tone completely changed into a final season of the Next Generation. It was so good to see the original crew back for one more adventure. As a fan of the series and films, i felt satisfied in that the TNG story has been concluded. For new fans that began with Picard, you might feel as if his story wasn't concluded and you would be right. It was like they completely forgot what he was doing before he met up with Riker. Maybe they'll address it later in an upcoming project. But i for one, am happy that season 3 brought back some old friends one last time.","rating":"10\/10","date":"5 September 2023"}

Seasons 1 and 3 garner 9-10 stars, but season 2 got a bit lost and warrant 6 stars. Season 3 completely nails it. Star Trek aficionados will be able to pick right up with this series. All of it is superbly acted and well directed. It deepens the emotional content of the characters, which was a great add. The special effects were sweet, and always used to support the story and action. If you're not familiar with Star Trek, especially TheNext Generation series, it may help if you find a Trekkie to help with the background and context.","rating":"9\/10","date":"24 April 2023"}
{"title":"Inconsistent season one and two. But three knocks it out of the park","review":"I have been a life long fan of Star Trek, especially of the next generation. The inventive story telling and characters that are truly likeable are just some of the many reasons to watch and rewatch the series. So the return of this crew was incredibly exciting for me. With that being said, this series as a whole is a mixed bag, ranging from truly mediocre to the best offerings period. It's this mediocrity of seasons one and two that keep me from giving this a 10\/10 for season 3s superb return to form.Season one was a slog to watch. Had it not been during Covid I may not have kept up with it each week, but it was something to do. Picard felt like the writers didn't really know what to do with him without the enterprise to helm and stumbled their way through. Add to that new characters that I felt no connections with and a cookie cutter sky beam ending, and you have a bore that deserves a 5\/10 at most. The series was so determined to take it to a dark and edgy place, they forgot to keep the characters likeable. It was truly disappointing for Star Trek fans everywhere.Season two was a marked improvement. The return of Q, perhaps my favourite villain, was welcomed for me. The characters finally had something to do, but still the series focused more on the new side characters than in the truly compelling story between Picard and Q. This season was much more entertaining though, and was more what I though a Picard centric series should be. Over all, this was an 8\/10 for me, especially for the conclusion to the Picard and Q relationship.Season three is where the good stuff it though. This season alone is worth any Star Trek fans time and admiration. Although it is a little too concerned about being dark and edgy still, it feels more grounded within the established universe. The return of the original crew was extremely welcomed, and the \"new\" villain was a great choice for the series. Over all, this felt like the true follow up to the movie nemesis.All I can really say is that if you watch any of this series, just watch season three, it's worthy of your time.","rating":"8\/10","date":"29 July 2023"}
{"title":"Amazing","review":"As a very latecomer to watching Star Trek Picard because the first 2 episodes of season one didn't pull me to continue watching the rest as all the other shows had. Star Trek, The next Generation, Deep Space Nine, Star Trek Voyager. These shows have amazed me into see not what is but to what is possible. I have followed the World of Star Trek since the very beginning and loved it. As a regular follower of what's going on through IMDB, I saw Picard had a third season so I had to give it another chance. This show has amazed me and loving it.

All major franchises are being ruined with this political junk. I'm sick of it, and I'm exhausted by watching all of my life long heroes being destroyed by extreme left ideologies.Most characters are female, and the males are portrayed as weak, beta, disposable, violent, primitive, and stupid. I'm so fed up with us men being portrayed as obsolete. This IS offensive trash.Oh look, there is a problem with the world. Send in the empowered women, and make sure the men know their place. In chains, on their knees, and subservient.I walked out of the room today on Episode 3 of Season 2. Watching the women beam down perfectly, and Seven of Nine being asked if she's a super hero. Rios basically broke his face. I assume his teleported malfunctioned? I was losing interest since mid season 1. I only watched bits of it here and there while my gf had it on the tv. I just played my rpgs on my computer.This is not Star Trek at all. This is a crime against Gene, and Majel Barrett. I'm seriously disgusted with this show. *PUKE*Trek to me growing up was about exploration, science, egalitarianism, and humans in the final frontier. It was about a hopeful future, and a mixed species galaxy where we want all interactions with races to be a peaceful one.Think Darmok and Jalad! <3<3<3<3<3This is a forced narrative wrapped in a successful franchise. Honestly, I loved Sir Patrick Stewart growing up.. I loved TNG. I'm going to start researching foreign non political entertainment now.This is where I'm out.

Sure we come in all types, shapes and sizes but it seems that a show can no longer be made without a female dominant character, a token gay or transgender, toss in a love story here and there and the plot is set.We all know these are small parts of our society but we have allowed it to pervade every single area of our lives.The white guy or girl is the villain now, the darker guy or girl is the hero and if they are female all the better it seems. Strong female characters are great but not at the expense of all the other options. Where is the balance?I have no issue with the inclusion of any person with any belief or sexual preference no matter what, but the balance has been lost. If aliens were watching us from outer space they would think we were 10% transgender, 60% gay and 30% undecided.The industry needs to take a long hard look at itself and stop trying to push their personal views on the masses.This show wont get another second of my time and I was hoping for much more than I got.","rating":"2\/10","date":"4 February 2020"}

Trek has through the years sought to champion (with varying degrees of succeed) minorities and those whose voices may not always be easily heard. It was well ahead of the game in the 60s with racial diversity; though painfully behind the curve in the 90s with sexual orientation. Here we have a lead character who centralises the issue of age and being elderly in a way that is rarely seem on mainstream TV. And by doing this through an actor as nuanced and elegant as Stewart, those who know some of their best days may not be behind them (but have trouble convincing the rest of the world of this) have a rare and worthy hero!","rating":"10\/10","date":"23 January 2020"}

{"title":"Dull","review":"I was hoping to see a refreshing reboot of the Star Trek franchise, but what I got was a dull X Men-looking story. And what was with the faded colors? Was this supposed to be set in the 1940s. I'm not a fan of style over substance approach to most TV shows nowadays. You need to create interesting characters, have good dialogue, and of course, a good story. Looking pretty isn't enough. And these over arcing season story lines are cliched now. Maybe go back to episodic stories.\nAnyway, I'll update my review if this gets better, but usually if a show doesn't pull me in after 2 or 3 episodes, I'm gone. Like what happened with Discovery, I didn't bother following it after the first half of the first season.Edit: Well, I'm three episodes in, and the show has NOT improved. What happened to the magic and wonder of the original Star Trek? After the last episode, I happened to catch one of the old TNGs (the first episode of the series) and I found it more compelling and exciting to watch than any of these new Star Treks. Why do these new Star Treks need to be dark, and boring? And there's waaay too much incidental music. Seriously, not every scene needs background music to 'set the mood'. I won't be watching any more episodes. I also lowered my original 3 to a 1.\nSecond update: Episode 4, I had the show on the TV as background noise. Nothing peaked my interest to stop what I was doing and watch. I guess they're waiting until the season finale to actually kick-start the show? This one will be lucky to make it to season 2.","rating":"1\/10","date":"24 January 2020"}

Now I'm up to episode 8 and the pace and excitement have dramatically picked up, and the story is really unraveling.Not only does it feel like I can't wait until the next episode airs, but I'm also getting the feeling that the writers really care about the legacy of TNG (I can't say why without getting into spoiler territory).

The glaring problem for me was it didn't feel 'futuristic' enough and didn't seem to be related to any TNG\/Voyager\/DS9 world.Then I got over myself.The story is intricate. The characters are full. So please, if you love Star Trek then persevere.YES. It doesn't look like anything you're used to. The technology looks old for TNG\/Voyager universe. But this is a reboot for 2020 and they need to capture a new audience. Wonder what the Original Series fans thought of TNG? \u00f0\u0178\u02dc\u201aFor me it looks like it's 25\/50 years in the future from 2020 for styling, ambience and household tech. So still a bit bored\/disappointed but I've managed to ignore it.I also thought \"If Voyager and Enterprise were top grade military vessels then OF COURSE civilian stuff wouldn't look the same\". I suggest anyone looks up the SR71 Blackbird online. That aircraft is so old and is now retired but I DEFY you not to be impressed and think it looks like something from the future!!!???So if you're new to the Star Trek Universe then Welcome. If you're used to it, focus on the story and remember that Picard is retired! He's SUPPOSED to be an old man! (No offence Patrick).I feel Star Trek has now entered Space Opera territory like Patrick Hamilton and Neal Asher.8\/10 for story and characters. Minus 2 for aesthetics (too easy\/dull).","rating":"10\/10","date":"21 March 2020"}
{"title":"What can I say","review":"Well first and foremost it's Picard so how can you go wrong. He is the best Star Trek Captain ever. However 7 of 9 is far superior. Make a star trek show about her and her becoming a queen that takes over the Borg. But let's face it in today's age we are so close to AI Robotics we fear we will start the Borg here on earth. I have two children so I hope that never happens but we all know that at some point AI Robotics and humans will merge someday. Once you merge in the cybernetic way to help people like me who are disabled. The leap from helping disabled people to modification by choice to have better hearing or breathe underwater will eventually come to pass. Then two nerd lovers will say let's share our mind. Then they may add others or share their tech for other people who want to be close to one another. But eventually someone or a group will want to take over and eventually the group will grow larger. Then you will have your Borg.","rating":"10\/10","date":"22 October 2022"}
{"title":"How is this not Trek?","review":"Look, I've looked at some of these reviews and obviously they know NOTHING about Trek. I have been watching Trek since I was five. I'm forty five now. I wasn never a \"Trekkie\" or the like but I appreciated the show, the concept and the stories. I have seen every single episode of the original Trek as well as TNG, Deep Space and Voy. I have watched every movie including the new incarnations and I can truly say, this IS Trek. People who crap on this obviously are tourists of Trek and nothing more. This is Trek and it proves it..","rating":"8\/10","date":"12 March 2020"}
{"title":"Overall disappointment","review":"I love star trek but this show is not star trek of any kind. I don't understand the use of the f bomb in the show. All the other ones were just fine without using that. No need listen to your star trek fans and straighten up your act or this one is not for me.","rating":"2\/10","date":"5 February 2020"}
{"title":"What did they expect","review":"A lot of the reviews are very negative. I think this is undeserved. I'm a real fan of TNG but this series isn't TNG. it doesn't need to be. Things changed the last 30 years. TV shows change to. It's a nice show in the Star Trek universe that can attract new fans. Cherish the past but don't hope for a return of TNG. On the other hand, I do miss the optimism of the older Star Trek series, but it's difficult to be optimistic in these times for everybody.","rating":"8\/10","date":"20 March 2020"}
{"title":"A lot lacking","review":"I really wanted to like the show. But after continued watching you come to realize the show has about 3 minutes of relevancy. People coming and going. The main characters lack any chemistry. For the most part it is very predicable and you find yourself frustrated feeling that watching was a waste of time. Too much filler.","rating":"2\/10","date":"28 February 2020"}
{"title":"Very good in a different way","review":"I think most people were expecting the same Star Trek format as before. This is so good. Patrick Stewart said he would never go back to being captain of the Enterprise... in other-words... the same old format. And he has not. I found it intriguing and constantly building on the story-line. You have to open your mind to it being different than any Star Trek or you will not like it. If you can do that then...engage!","rating":"9\/10","date":"27 March 2020"}
{"title":"Excellent","review":"I'm a die-hard Star Trek fan from the 60s. At first I was skeptical about this series but by the second episode I was hooked. My husband and I make it popcorn and movie night each Thursday on streaming digital. I love the AI synth theme and the paranoid warning from deepest space and time. It's sad to see some cracks in StarFleet but whoever said it was incorruptible?Great acting! Patrick Stewart is amazing, of course, as Picard. Happy to see Seven of Nine again, the six faces of Rios, Soji, etc...etc.Can't wait for Thursday!","rating":"9\/10","date":"13 March 2020"}
{"title":"Not a star trek, but good scifi series.","review":"After reading some revievs I logged first time to IMDB to write one myself.I was afraid that Star trek would be more of the same. It isn't and I am glad about that. The old Star trek formula have been used to death and I can't see how it could possibly success any more. Many revievs are complaining that this isn't Star trek any more and I agree. Gene Roddenberry wouldn't approve this and you shouldn't think this is.The good think is that this series have continueous and interesting plot, good actors and direction. There is great character development and they feel like real people. Story isn't predictable at all and you don't have a clue what will happen next. When main characters are in combat, you actually fear that they might die, because they can. Starfleet is a political organization and it might crush you to survive. It has always been, but now you can't ignore that any more.The bad news is that while this series waddles in the grey area, it is shallow. Old school scifi mirrored the problems in the real world and challenged moral choices. I don't see that here and this series is unnecessary violent to shock people, not to make them think. This definitely isn't classic, but this is interesting series to all ADULTS, who don't expect actually to see more Star trek.","rating":"8\/10","date":"7 March 2020"}
{"title":"Great","review":"Yes a lot of ripoff from diffrent movies, beautifully shot. so many great characters so many lovely memories from the past. is it diffrent to tng voyager ds9 ? yes it is but thats the point.","rating":"10\/10","date":"21 May 2020"}
{"title":"Poor","review":"Like most I'm 4 episodes in quite frankly I find this incantation of Star Trek, so far very poor. Patrick Stewart's acting is as always awful. He may be good on the stage but his acting style doesn't translate to the small or big screen. The storyline so far is usual Star Trek with some Kung Fu added. The baddies still can't shoot straight or hit anything. You would think in the 24th century where vessels can travel faster than the speed of light and matter can be transported to another location they would invent a gun that never misses it target. Especially when the phaser bolt travels nearly the speed of light. The baddies always attack in single file. Never en-mass. It's just poor poor poor and very poor.","rating":"3\/10","date":"17 February 2020"}
{"title":"Star Trek done right","review":"A joy to watch.I'm not even all that upset that Discovery moved away from Netflix and now I have no way to watch it. At least I have my Picard. I'd pick P over D any day. Lol.","rating":"8\/10","date":"19 March 2022"}
{"title":"Laziness wins through","review":"It's a shame the first series was interesting not perfect by any imagination, but interesting and I enjoyed it. The second series fell upon the prey of the laziness of Star Trek the next generation where they brought in queue so they don't have to worry about any storyline just need to worry about making things exciting but in the process that made everything boringBecause what is the point he is an omnipotent being he can do whatever he wants therefore the series is dead, well done morons.","rating":"5\/10","date":"25 March 2022"}
{"title":"A new Star Trek","review":"First of all, I like this one. More then Discovery. It's definitely not a traditional Star Trek show, but I bet they did this because there is already the Discovery(show) going on as \"traditional\" version of Star Trek. This one is more real, more connecting with reality, and storyline in a way much more like TNG then Voyager or DS9, but with interesting enough subplot(of both UFP internal politics and galactic politics). Writing is great, acting and dialogue are also super. There seem to have a habit to put some \"action\" in to every episode(on 6 now), I think they did this because they afraid some people might find episode lack of action boring.One important thing I suggest every people does is watch the show and form your own opinions! There seem to some type review bombing going on here(and same ppl keep saying Picard shows numbers has be manipulated,lol!), now days one cant really trust review numbers any more. But I like that studio have the balls to try something new. Same was like DS9, breaking the illusion of perfect paradise. But you will get some heat and hate because the different way you go.Also there seem to disturbing many \"review bombing\" this show because the strong women in the show, and calling this show driving feminist agenda? o.O. LoL! It always hilarious when some people can be scared off by strong female characters...","rating":"9\/10","date":"5 March 2020"}
{"title":"Strongest of new Star Trek shows. Does Fit Picard's story.","review":"Just finished the whole series, so let's get straight to the point... Show is leaps better than \"Discovery\" and is a fitting continuation of Star Trek: Nemesis timeline. If for no other reason, the show is a tribute to Picard and Data and the resolution of them is well worth the show.Should also be noted just how awesome the previous TNG characters are in this. They are fun and again, makes the show well worth your time. This is a solid Star Trek show if for no other reason, gets back to the philosophical nature of humanity in the face of challenges or new ideas. The show also gets credit for keeping an open mind, unlike \"Discovery\" a show that already imagined all its major show moments, it just uses the show as a excuse to watch them play out, boringly. There's no upper debate on anything.Yes the show works. There are moments the magic is back from TNG, and full resolutions to characters was well recieved. My only complaint was the show felt a little slow at times, but does pick up in future episodes.","rating":"9\/10","date":"6 May 2020"}
{"title":"Wow! People are so negative here!","review":"I'm a bit shocked that ST:P was rated so lowly by so many...and in a strongly disparaging way...but without many specifics to complain about. OK: Let's start with the basics. Acting quality. Who were the weak actors in this series? Anyone blithely out of character? Didn't think so. Plot lines. Boring plots? No intrigue? Deals with unimportant issues? Nope. Too hip, modern, aka cursing. It's not up to the fracking level but was the cussing over the top or way out of line or inappropriately used to emphasize a point? I didn't think so. Wokeness. Yup: Plenty of woke topics and woke actions. Gosh, can we discuss inter-species \/ inter-racial \/ inter-sexual situations on ST, ST:TNG, ST:V, ST-DS9, etc? Should ST stay away from topics like AI self-determination, immigration status and treatment, sexuality, treatment of aliens? That wouldn't be in keeping with ST's history. This is still well-worn territory for ST.Is it bad the feel of ST:P's two seasons were based on all-or-nothing outcomes like TNG: All Good Things (certainly), or V: End Game? In particular in the 2nd Season, the entire plot revolved around Picard but you didn't know exactly what needed to happen \/ be proven. It wasn't all pretty or pat. Were things too Woke at the end? Did too many get their hearts broken by a foreshowed but not ST:V consistent change of sexual preferences by one of the main characters? Is that the basis for the crying and complaining? Regardless, anyone claiming the series didn't involve Picard is missing a positronic synapse or two.What would Roddenberry complain about here? I saw lots of pretty women in some amazing outfits so check! Seriously.ST:P. Anytime I can get to see this acting quality I'm fully in. I didn't think the modern touches were way out of line (it's not like the entire series was set in the 1400s). Too much mayhem? Too much blood? Not in a grossly gratuitous fashion. So much complaining without clear target locks.","rating":"9\/10","date":"17 November 2022"}
{"title":"Star trek!","review":"What can I say I love star trek and this series is great the more star trek shows the better keep them coming!

{"title":"What a let down","review":"Star Trek: The Next Generation was successful in being true to T.O.S. both in format (weekly stories with some continuing threads) a decisive and charismatic captain and plenty of baddies to blast.In episode 1 of this we have grandad and some woke players and what looks to be a dragged our story without any conclusion week after week.Not your dad's Star Trek. Not really Star Trek at all.","rating":"4\/10","date":"24 January 2020"}
{"title":"Like it!","review":"Don't know why so manny people dislike this show. Currently watching season 2 and it's fine as well. Maybe to little high tech stuff and space travel in season 2 but other than that it's ok. Hoping for yet another season to come! Maybe the real Star Trek fans prefer the every episode a new adventure and space travel episode with interesting new worlds and rases and Star Trek Picard is more for the general public... all I can say is to give it a chance and maybe you can persuade a non Star Trek fan to watch it with you as I'm sure they like it as well! A shame dough only Seven makes a appearance from ST Voyager.","rating":"9\/10","date":"16 November 2022"}
{"title":"Unwatchable","review":"Worse than I ever could have imagined or anticipated. Worse than Discovery! Stiff acting from everyone, but it's hard to blame them with the unintelligible plot and horrific lines. Patrick Stewart tries his best, but nothing, not even him can overcome how bad the writing and directing is.","rating":"1\/10","date":"18 February 2020"}
{"title":"Star Trek fan","review":"I'm a huge star trek fan, Next gen is one of my favorites. This is hands down the best season 1 of any star trek show.

{"title":"Great next chapter for Star Trek","review":"People who are long time fans and people totally new to Star Trek will enjoy this show. They honor the cannon and history but also tell a new story. The characters have more shades of grey than in TNG, and it provides dimension. You will enjoy this story!","rating":"10\/10","date":"28 March 2020"}
{"title":"Looking forward to season 2","review":"This isn't the next generation 2.0, that's why it's not titled that. It's very much in the vein of Discovery with a darker, brooding take on the future than previous shows. It's a grown up story about a man who's lost his way and trying to find some of his former fire whilst righting his mistakes late on in life.\nThere's plenty of action and sci-fi, lots of federation lore, some pleasing cameos and is a suspenseful story.\nMinor criticisms are too much exposition and distractions from glaring rotational lighting in early episodes and Patrick Stewart's inevitably aged cracked voice (although I got used to that towards the end).\nIf you liked the more recent, darker star trek discovery seasons or just like sci-fi in general I urge you to give it a go and not to be discouraged by the old style trekkie fan boys and girls who were expecting something different and threw tantrums when it turned out to be something unexpected.","rating":"8\/10","date":"15 March 2020"}
{"title":"I'm so disappointed...","review":"I was so excited when I heard this was in development. I'm a science fiction fan who loved TOS as a kid and loved Next Generation. Never really got DS9, but Voyager and Enterprise had there moments too.Picard is awful. I guess this is what happens when the creators don't have a story to tell. Through three episodes it's seems as CBS wants all access viewers, and the \"producers\" wanted a science fiction allegory vehicle to preach to us the evils of the Big Meanie and spread their woke beliefs. They really must think the audience are deplorables and sorely in need of some hollywood education.So far this is an overly complicated space action soap opera with no connection to the world of star trek other than Picard. The writing is better on some of the Christmas Hallmark movies my wife watches. The actor do the best they can with the awful material.Maybe Hollywood should just get back to entertainment and attempt creating great shows with compelling stories. The Expanse is a show that does just that. This is just plain awful.","rating":"1\/10","date":"8 February 2020"}
{"title":"Lower ratings are just stupid","review":"Hi people, just watch the show and ignore the fanboys. It is exciting and nostalgic, it is getting into the action from Ep 3. Don't give up on the show, the first few episodes are always the slow apetizers.","rating":"9\/10","date":"15 February 2020"}
{"title":"How can you really like this?","review":"I started watching not expecting anything in particular, just hoping for a good TV series.\nI HONESTLY wonder how everyone in his right mind might ever like this.1) It's OH SO DULL.\nAfter 7 episodes everyone I know is so tired of this they're considering stop watching, The background story just isn't there, entire episodes spent introducing useless characters that are gonna die immediately. Nothing really ever happens, and they don't even really tell us what happened in the past apart from a few messy scenes\/images.2) Probably the worst writing I've seen in ANY series recently.\nThere are a bunch of recurring roles, who are invariably shallow, useless or boring, if not plainly bad.\nThey keep introducing familiar faces from previous Star Trek only to kill them off in the most useless and nonsense way, for no purpose really.\nBut the worst, ALL of these characters are so incredibly unreasonable: they say one thing (\"I cannot leave you! I devoted my life to the mission of helping you!\") and then immediately after do the exact opposite (\"we have to go? No I'll stay here, hello\").\nReally, I don't know how many times characters of this show did the exact opposite of what they kept repeating, believing or so. Always without any reason or sense.\nI'm still trying to get one single role I lilke in the show, apart from Picard (who in a sense doesn't even seem to belong to the show at all)..3) It's not just dark. There's gory violence.\nOk it's not Star Trek, it's not happy ending after all, and the future is much darker than you'd imagine. But here there's more - a very visual and gore torture sequence, showing violence and death of a known character, just to provide some minimal background to another character which leaves the show perhaps 15 minutes later.4) Cameos parading.\nEntire episodes devoted to one or two cameos of actors\/characters from Star Trek, TNG or Voyager. Always to no real purpose apart from \"hey look how old he got\". They say nothing about the character, so we discover nothing about whatever happened to them. So, what's the point? Just to add another useless episode?All in all I give 2 stars just because there's Patrick Stewart acting in this, but I feel sorry for him.\nPlease, please, please: fire the writers and the producers and get someone who knows what he's doing.","rating":"3\/10","date":"8 March 2020"}
{"title":"I want some more...","review":"Yep folks , i want more ... the more the better . I gave nine stars only cos' i became\ncynical lately about the cheap franchises excluding of course, N.G.\nOther than that, this \" Picard \" , it looks really good, the CGI , the acting, the directorship, and of course the writing .\nIt will be a really good show , if all will keep going like now .\nTen stars are waiting for you guys , just do what you do right now .\nCongratulations for the first two episodes .","rating":"9\/10","date":"31 January 2020"}

{"title":"Finally, A Second Great TNG Movie","review":"\"Star Trek: Picard\" is intelligent, thoughtful, comoelling, thrilling, moving, meaningful, everything that good \"Star Trek\" should be. It not only rectifies the mistake of ending TNG on the low note of the derivative and hollow \"Nemesis\", it actually manages to retroactively give that film some resonance.The writers of this series clearly have great respect for and understanding of these characters, and it comes through in every moment that Picard , Riker, Deanna Troi, Data, Hugh or Seven of Nine is on screen. I can't help but feel those who express disappointment are those who just want \"Trek\" to be comfortable, not challenging. This series is art and is one of the few things on the air worthy of the hype claiming we're in some sort of golden age of television. Simply excellent on practically every level.","rating":"10\/10","date":"6 April 2020"}
{"title":"Really quiet terrible","review":"It has nothing to do with Star Trek or the character of Picard we came to love. So that's gone... the story is dull and boring and we hardly care for anybody if not for sentimental reasons (Seven, JL!!!, Riker, Troi...) The dialogue is pretending to be deep and meaningful but it's just a bunch of platitudes and mediocre acting. As a generic sci-fi show it would be rather crap, but as a Star Trek show with the name Picard in it it's utterly disappointing!","rating":"1\/10","date":"14 March 2020"}
{"title":"One of my favourite Sci-Fi shows currently airing","review":"I tried posting a review previously but i guess it didn't make the cut for some reason. So anyway Star Trek Picard! In most ways the spiritual successor of The Next Generation. The one key difference is the focus on just one main plot line as opposed to the prolific classic's ability to tackle many subjects. But what I loved from the oldie is still present in this iteration: a sense of awe, strange alien cultures, otherworldly technologies, captivating characters.However this show is not for those with prejudices of any kind. Which is a strange thing to even consider since the whole premise of the series explores the negative effects of prejudice against synthetic life and Romulans. What were people expecting? Another criticism brought against this show was that the focus on politics and drama somehow makes it less Star Trek. To paraphrase that particular reviewer he or she believed this makes ST: Picard just another cookie cutter show. Obviously this person skipped many episodes of The Next Generation that were very focused on exactly those aspects. Nowadays viewers believe a modicum of depth or, heavens forbid, the presence of a moral compass is too woke.Unlike The Next Generation however Picard adds a layer of complexity to its characters. In the previous show the men and women of the various species portrayed had issues but, from what I remembered, weren't affected by them at the natural intensity a real person would. They kind of glided through them without getting really impacted.The story progression is perfect: each episode gives enough to satisfy without revealing too much. While the story itself is intriguing to say the least: a multi pronged conspiracy involving multiple species.If you loved The Next Generation, you will definitely love Star Trek Picard as well.","rating":"9\/10","date":"28 February 2020"}
{"title":"Destruction of Star Trek and abandonment of canon.","review":"I was excited enough about this to subscribe to Amazon prime, in spite of my general refusal to use Amazon. It makes the betrayal so much worse.The essence of Trek was that humanity had evolved beyond money, beyond bigotry, beyond nationalism, racism and imperialism. It had joined (not initiated) the Federation. It wasn't in charge of it, it was a member of a multi-species confederation, introduced to it by the Vulcans. Starfleet was a quasi-military fleet for Earth. The Enterprise, in all it's iterations, was a ship of exploration as well as a flagship involved in defence. Voyager was even more an exploration ship. Starfleet eschewed aggression. The crew found itself in various situations and worked together. It respected all life, even if it seemed dangerous. It recognised diversity, and the underlying value of all being \"life, but not as we know it\".Picard violates all that. Earth is now isolationist, and all the thousands of other species just gave up the federation. Starfleet is racist, and controlled by spies for Vulcan or Romulus. It's a dystopian world. Picard gathers together a plucky band of rebels and misfits, a la Firefly, and sets out to get some guy, and murder anyone in the way. Some Romulans are salvaging a Borg cube that looks like it came from Blade Runner, with dry ice and wandering light beams in dark background. Other Romulans are apparently in \"third world\" poverty, with almost nothing (and they've all developed dark skins). There is a group of female Middle-eastern Romulan Hashashim who hate the Tal Shihar. Picard come is like Sahib. All he needs it a pith helmet.It's a complete violation of everything that made Trek what it was, without being anything but derivative and poor SciFi. If the producers wanted to do a story like this, they should have done it without invoking the framework of Trek. But it would have been a sad series with nothing that hasn't been done elsewhere better.There are several good actors in this, more the shame. I don't blame them for wanting the work, but it's too bad the concept and writing are so poor.","rating":"1\/10","date":"24 February 2020"}
{"title":"Awesome!","review":"I find this show entertaining, exciting and fresh. It combines old characters and new, creating something all it's own. Is it like the other series'? No, and I don't think it's supposed to. It's supposed to be it's own thing. All of the negative reviews clearly come from a place of closemindedness. From people expecting the same Trek but got something different and couldn't handle it.\nIf you want something fresh then you will enjoy the series; if you expect the same Trek then you won't.\nBeing someone who has been a fan of Trek since TNG, I highly enjoy it and highly recommend it.","rating":"10\/10","date":"17 February 2020"}

{"title":"Simply magnificent","review":"A little late criticism of this magnificent series, which is more than a sequel to The New Generation, Star Trek: Picard, it is a resolutely modern series, whether in terms of image or narration, from natural settings to special effects, through the choreography of the fights, everything is sublime, the impeccable performance of \"Patrick Stewart\" (Picard), is all in finesse and spark of empathy. The series starts smoothly, to intensify as it unfolds its full capacity for seduction. It is moreover very rare to see a series which positively affects the human and positions the human spirit in a more obliging manner and encourages the spectator to think positively of a future which currently is still not looking good, so a little freshness, will know what to do good. There is an interesting and captivating story of superb special effects, beautiful colors of beautiful science fiction that will delight all fans and positivize others. An incredibly well done series that I loved and that I obviously recommend.","rating":"8\/10","date":"15 June 2020"}

I'd rather have a show that relates to today than some utopian unrealistic world.

{"title":"Seriously? Picard?? Star Trek??? Murder Trek: Pukehard is the title that fits","review":"NOTICE: a lot of the positive reviews on here are CBS shills that have just registered with IMDb to help the Picard rating, and don't take my word for it, check it out for yourselves. Wow, just have a look at poor Jurati blowing groceries so many times and you see where I came up with the title Pukehard. Plus you have dark Abrams glarey visuals, oh and yeah Secret Hideout is linked to Bad Robot so the lens flares and extreme shaky cam is a plenty. Then there's the torture and murder of beloved characters. (Yeah I liked Hugh). Many murders in this season, not counting the borg. Star Trek Discovery and Picard are connected, Notice the 2 Enterprise holograms over Picard's head when he walks into starfleet. The Enterprise D looks normal but the Enterprise we see next is the Discovery version of the original Enterprise which is a sign from the showrunners that Picard and Discovery are linked. This is the result of bad crappy writers and editing, corporate yes men and hacks that ripped the optimistic heart and soul right out of Star Trek.","rating":"1\/10","date":"8 April 2020"}
{"title":"Star Trek Picard","review":"Beloved character Jean-Luc Picard, played by the even more beloved actor Patrick Stewart, returns to the small screen nearly 20 years after his last appearance in Star Trek: Nemesis (the only one of the 10 films in the original Star Trek film series that I've never watched). The premise of the series is that 14 years before it begins, Admiral Picard was active in relocating the Romulan people before the star near their home planet went supernova. After synthetic life forms carry out a devastating act of sabotage on the Federation's facilities on Mars, the Federation calls off the relocation project and ban all synthetic life. Angry at these two betrayals, Picard resigns from Starfleet.In the present day a young woman, Dahj (Isia Briones), seeks out Picard's help after realizing that she is an android created from the remains of Picard's friend Data (Brent Spiner) . Romulan spies kill Dahj, but not before Picard learns that she has an identical twin, Soji, working at a Romulan outpost on an abandoned Borg cube called The Artifact.Picard puts together a crew to help find and help Soji. This includes a friend and colleague who helped with Romulan relocation, Raffi (Michelle Hurd), who struggles with substance abuse. Raffi finds a captain with a ship, La Sirena, Chris (Santiago Cabrera) who has a traumatic background in Starfleet. They are joined by Agnes (Alison Pill), a synthetic life expert who is naive about space travel. Along the way they pick up Elnor (Evan Evagora), a samurai-like Romulan who was raised by a sect of warrior nuns to provide protection. To please the fans, familiar characters from the Star Trek franchise make appearances, including former Borg Seven of Nine (Jeri Ryan), and Picard's crewmates from Enterprise, Will Riker (Jonathan Frakes) and Deanna Troi ( Marina Sirtis). Brent Spiner also returns to play Data in dream sequences and Altan Inigo Soong, the son of Data's creator. One of the weird aspects of the show is that Picard not only quit Starfleet, but hasn't kept in touch with any of his friends which is both out of character and used to create artificial tension.In the early episodes, the show moves slowly, setting up Picard's current situation and introducing the new characters. There are elements of mystery and spy thriller with Picard thrust into the role of detective. It was a refreshing change from the fast-paced action for action's sake of Star Trek: Discovery. By the end of episode 3 when we finally see Picard on the bridge of a starship and hear him say \"Engage!,\" it is a cheezy moment for the fans but one that is well-earned. Unfortunately, during the second half of the season the show goes off the rails. All the worst instincts of Discovery for shocking twists are indulged and a lot of drama is forced from the characters making bold choices to raise the stakes that seem irrelevant a few scenes later.For a show called Picard, the title character seems lost in the crowded cast. And yet, we don't really get to know the new characters all that well either. Sometimes they seem to do things that are out of character, but then their characters never seem to be developed well enough to know in the first place. I loved Star Trek: Generation as a kid, but the level of graphic violence and profanity in Picard that makes it \"gritty and dark,\" makes me not want to share it with my kids. There was some promise in Picard, and maybe it will be fulfilled in the upcoming two seasons that are in production, but right now I don't feel compelled at all to want to watch them.","rating":"9\/10","date":"26 February 2022"}
{"title":"Disappointing","review":"Tried to watch it, stopped. Came back to it a few months later and 6 episodes in I remember why I stopped the first time. First of all, what on earth did they do to Picard?! And Starfleet?! And Seven?! (Doesn't help that I just finished rewatching Voyager). When did the Romulans turn hipster with too much facial hair? I mean, go dark, fine by me, the darker the better, but that's not dark, it's just destroying beloved characters. Plot wise, of course it's all about about a conspiracy. And a conspiracy within the conspiracy within the conspiracy and on and on. Everyone is triple\/ quadruple agent, because you know..! Basically the same crap you can see in say, every single other series\/ movies coming out these days? Star Trek used to be original, innovative, thought-provoking, entertaining! This is boring, run of the mill, seen a hundred times before, basic storyline. Visually yes it's slick, like everything else out there, all show no substance. Think I'll rewatch TNG instead","rating":"3\/10","date":"20 May 2020"}
{"title":"Everything inside me says I am safe with you!","review":"Dajh's comment to Picard \"Everything inside me says I am safe with you!\" summarizes what Star Trek and this series is for every Star Trek fan.\nAll round brilliant and a good start to the TNG sequel.","rating":"9\/10","date":"26 January 2020"}

{"title":"Great!!!!","review":"I'm stunned with all the bad user reviews.\nI've seen them before watching the series, thinking i'll pass it.. glad i didn't!\nIt's definitely starTrek and definitely Picard, great sci-fi plot, reminds me of the expanse.\nI'm in episode 7 and going strong, on the edge of my sit.","rating":"9\/10","date":"26 March 2020"}
{"title":"Does have its moments","review":"Just a short effort to dash off a review confirming my opinion that this Star Trek \"Picard\" is streets ahead of the recent moody Star Trek \"Discovery\" debacle.The way Seven of Nine made her entrance in the fourth episode of this series was just excellent. It came as a total shock to me but a great one. Always loved her acting in Star Trek \"Voyager\". A breath of fresh air. If only the \"Voyager\" hologram Doctor could find away aboard this ship too even though there is already one aboard this ship. Try and try again for a bit of humour. There is enough edge for me.So personally I think this series is leaps and bounds better than the \"Discovery\" series. It's a kind of old and new; a sort of family structure, if you can imagine Picard almost as a Grandad figure. That does work here, plus the avoidance of mean spirited characters. You know, the sort of \"I've got loads of personal problems so I don't really want to be here\" characters that were all over the \"Discovery\" series.It's much more difficult for a new series to find its way these days. There isn't scope for a massive build up and lots warm up episodes to get to know and love the characters. I can only say thank God the moaning cynical types don't appear to be so much in the mix here.By the way the people that rate this low go out of their way to down mark people who like it so beware of this.","rating":"8\/10","date":"16 February 2020"}
{"title":"Sad","review":"Was really looking forward to this. Favorite characters in your favorite show with hopefully an interesting story. After two episodes it's clear that this is a disaster. Gene Roddenberry must be rolling in his grave - it has nothing of the original Trek. It was so disappointing I doubt I will watch anymore.","rating":"1\/10","date":"2 February 2020"}
{"title":"Brilliant, people should watch all episodes before rating.","review":"After the bad reviews, I waited until well after all episodes finished to watch it and found it an amazing evolution of the franchise. I guess the die hard ST fans didn't like change of a continuous storyline. I'd highly recommend waiting before rating. Can't wait for season 2.","rating":"10\/10","date":"1 July 2020"}
{"title":"It's not Star Trek, it's Star Trash.","review":"I'm sorry for the harsh title but I mean it. This is not a Star Trek show or even a good show.The 1st episode makes it clear the writers never watched Star Trek. Ever. First off, there's no currency in Star Trek. The writers forgot that and decided to reintroduce money into this. The peoples rid themselves of currency, thus creating a utopia, in the real Star Treks.\nIn Picard, poverty, mercenaries, rich people, financial classes and woes are back like they never left.2nd, this has ultra-violent crap and ridiculously unnessecary swearing abound. This show caters to a sadistic and moronic audience who desires to see dystopian futures e.i. not Trekkies.All the good Star Trek shows, from the Original Series to Star Trek: Enterprise heavily valued living beings and hope. Enemies of the Federation would still be shown as people; living, thinking, breathing people. ST: Picard treats people like disposable garbage who will suffer gory fates with no end in sight. It is bleak and dreary, the opposite of what Star Trek is about.","rating":"1\/10","date":"25 February 2020"}

{"title":"I guess I'll be the weird one, as I loved it and love The Orville too. Shrug!","review":"I'm not exactly sure what is pissing off so many people honestly. How else do you get Picard to come out of retirement than something along this story line? There almost had to be a droid threat of some sort to life in the universe. Otherwise, there would be no motivation for Picard. I personally enjoyed the cameos and have no inkling at why that upset so many here. I feel like people seriously want to hate anything from their youth or some crap. I guess my only qualm would be some of the casting choices and quality of the actors. But with so many shows on tv now, it's got to be harder and harder to find the top talent for your series. Regardless, I really enjoyed the series and look forward to Season 2. I guess I'll never understand internet hate. I'll almost always embrace new ventures into space. Shrug","rating":"10\/10","date":"26 June 2020"}
{"title":"Fresh feel, same Picard","review":"I watched fearing they would Discovery it. They did not. Picard's character grew even deeper. Story is respectful to old series and the overall lore. Camera work is very nice. Some visual FX look cheesy (like the ship crash landed in the desert) but mostly are very nicely done. Played with great skill too. Would've been 10 if they had Worf and Crushers too.","rating":"9\/10","date":"1 April 2020"}
{"title":"Relevant review","review":"I enjoyed it very much. It was good to see some old faces. I very quickly liked the new characters, they did a good job.Storyline was good, the graphics were off the charts. It did get a little happy\/sad emotional at the end it of season 1, but FYI, that isn't what \"woke\" means.> All the bad reviews are from the same camp.The OG Star Trek die hards, who's mantra is: old Trek good, new trek bad.> They say things like, \"this isn't Star Trek\" and belittle the writers, actors, producers, hairstylists, caterers,etc. For even attempting such an insurmountable feat . How dare you !That's b\/c if it isn't corny and fake looking then it isn't \"real\" Star Trek.Gimme a break, quit your whining already and enjoy things for what they are.","rating":"9\/10","date":"6 March 2022"}
{"title":"Boring","review":"Star Trek is dead, seems no one is left that knows and understands it.

Is there nobody out there to save us?Sensors at maximum.....","rating":"1\/10","date":"5 February 2020"}
{"title":"So good it will make fanboys cry","review":"Star trek is back and better than ever. As the biggest fan of the Star Trek that has ever existed, I'm excited about the new show and look forward to seeing where it all leads. Is it Star Trek as we know it from TNG? No, thankfully not. It's far better. 10\/10.","rating":"10\/10","date":"1 April 2021"}
{"title":"This is not Star Trek as we know it","review":"I'm a big fan of star trek since captian Kirk's days. But these modern ST like discovery and Picard is just not the same. I prefer the 1 episode 1 story series instead of these rolling story line from week to week. Miss one episode and you lost the plot. Talking about plot. I can't work what's going on in Picard, maybe its so boring I keep getting distracted by other things going on around me. Stick to the original formulae of a ship exploring the unknown just like Roddenberry intended.","rating":"2\/10","date":"15 February 2020"}

{"title":"A New Generation of Star Trek","review":"I liked this show. I really did and I believe that it contained elements and values that reflect the best of the Star Trek franchise. Q's last line in \"All Good Things\" was \"For that one fraction of a second, you were open to options you had never considered. *That* is the exploration that awaits you. Not mapping stars and studying nebulae, but charting the unknown possibilities of existence.\"Star Trek Picard did a great job of merging the history and elements of the Next Generation and Voyager and a nod to DS9 (use of 3D console) with the look and feel that was the JJ Abrams and Discovery. It used a familiar theme of man vs machine as the plot, but in my humble opinion, Q's test was not the viability of the show, but the audience and fan's ability to chart and accept the possibilities with a new generation and new look and feel.The acting is great. The music and dialog are great. The special effects and use of commercial stock images and videos are palatable and clever. The chemistry between the Previous (former Next) Generation and this New Generation is good, witty and feels real. Just as I could day dream that I was in a storyline of the other franchises, I am able to day dream the same of this one. To me, that is an indication of a quality show.Be open minded, and take a leap of faith with this show.\nInvest in its future and soul, you will not be disappointed.","rating":"10\/10","date":"14 April 2020"}
{"title":"J-L rides from history into the beyond","review":"Brilliant series. Pity it is never to be extended. Seeing characters from the past, even to 7of9 was simply a brilliant part of the storyline.","rating":"9\/10","date":"28 March 2020"}
{"title":"What a waste!","review":"NOT Star Trek. It's a random cliche show that is trying to cash in on the Star Trek name and Patrick Stewart. Everyone is unlikable and as per the new Hollywood trend, they must destroy legacy characters like Picard as much as they can. Is there a scene where Picard isn't getting put down by a strong woman? It's very hammy.Also, the Federation is supposed to represent Rodenberry's ideal society, created from past conflicts and technology. No war, no poverty, diversity, working together for the greater good.This show? Makes it into a 21st century \"evil empire\" and ignores all of the things Start Trek was supposed to represent. Now everyone is worried about money?Production and sets look good, although stolen from better shows. Camerawork and lighting are good. Without the Start Trek name on this, it would be a turkey.","rating":"2\/10","date":"26 February 2020"}
{"title":"Love This Show.","review":"I was a major fan of the Next Generation and was hoping for the best and received even more - it is a great show and I am blown away by how much I love Star Trek: Picard. I was wondering would it be worth getting pay for CBS Access subscription just for one show and it definitely has been. Thank you to all those who chose to bring this show to being.","rating":"10\/10","date":"28 March 2020"}

{"title":"A new final frontier - age, dignity and determination","review":"Trek has through the years sought to champion (with varying degrees of success) minorities and those whose voices may not always be easily heard. It was well ahead of the game in the 60s with racial diversity; though painfully behind the curve in the 90s with sexual orientation. Here we have a lead character who centralises the issue of age and being elderly in a way that is rarely seem on mainstream TV. And by doing this through an actor as nuanced and elegant as Stewart, those who know some of their best days may not be behind them (but have trouble convincing the rest of the world of this) have a rare and worthy champion!","rating":"10\/10","date":"25 January 2020"}
{"title":"Too much haters here!","review":"I've been reading each and every one of the reviews and I'm almost in shock. Hundreds of people saying the same hollow things about The past. They define themselves as trekkies but they are not!\nThey say \"this is not Star Trek anymore\" What did they expect? All the TNG's old crew doing the same things after 30 years? Seriously?\nI like the show and I believe It is going to be a great entertainment.","rating":"8\/10","date":"7 February 2020"}
{"title":"Brought me back to the magic of TNG.","review":"As a young Adult I looked forward to every new episode of Star Trek next generation.

{"title":"Finally a season worthy of the name \"Stat Trek\"\"","review":"This is by far the best season out of all three if they had done this for season 1 and 2 it would have made this so much better but season 3 is excellent I'm glad they finally pulled their act together and gave us Star Trek fans something worthy of watching. When I first started watching this I thought here we go again weird plots strange things happening but then they started pulling in all of the old characters that we've all come to love and know and they may not be the same but they're still our characters and they give a lot of different storyline which really makes it even more interesting The prior seasons were basically about the card and data this is about the next generation.","rating":"9\/10","date":"18 April 2023"}
{"title":"I feel like I've read a sub-par fanfiction script","review":"I don't read novels based on Star Trek because they always have absolutely absurd stories that simply don't fit into the established universe, and it's usually written by a fanboy who never made it into writing teleplays.This is the impression throughout Picard. It's a mess of absurd ideas, completely unbelievable and unrelatable characters, all thinly strung together across far too many episodes, with the end result being not only very bad, but also insulting to the intelligence of the majority of people who have more than a passing interest in the franchise.Kill Picard and make a robot copy of him murder a copy of Data? Yeah, sounds like BAD fan fiction to me, and it is!It's disrespectful to the legacy of everyone who has ever worked in the franchise before this horrendous reboot. There is NO STORY! It's just a bunch of depressed, broken, miserable people I really couldn't care less about, in a miserable distopian universe, and they, like the writers and producers have turned their backs on Star Trek, on the fanbase, and on every value the show ever had.THE WRITERS AND PRODUCERS DO NOT UNDERSTAND STAR TREK OR WHY PEOPLE WATCH IT! And then they blame the audience.I instantly regret watching this now that I go back and watch canon trek reruns, I keep getting flashbacks to this horrific future they all end up in eventually, so what's the point in ever being hopeful about anything?I don't think I will be able to enjoy Trek ever again after what I've seen in this. Congratulations CBS, that's quite an achievement. You've broken the trust and indeed the interest in the franchise of millions of fans, and then flipped them off.If I could wipe my mind of this I would do it in an instant, but the damage is done now and ruined the enjoyment I from reruns.","rating":"1\/10","date":"21 February 2020"}
{"title":"Second Season","review":"After a few shaky episodes near the beginning, where they segued into unrelated political commentary, they gave us a story worthy of Picard and STNG. A good, solid save the galaxy quest with some great action, suspense, a few twists, science fiction tropes, thought provoking lessons, and some very human scenes which all tie together in the end to bring us full circle, in more ways than one. Best of all, the question of Q's motives is finally resolved. I won't spoil it; I'll just say have some tissues ready.","rating":"8\/10","date":"12 May 2022"}
{"title":"Why why why","review":"I love Star Trek. My 18 and 14 year old love it to. We, been though all the originals. But these discovery and the new Picard are not what Star Trek was about. I really hoped that Picard would be something we could enjoy. Why does this level of violence and language have be something that is needed for it to work. I stopped watching discovery when two people had the throats cut. It's has always been for young people to capture there imagination. Like me my dad and now my kids. Why why why","rating":"1\/10","date":"14 February 2020"}
{"title":"A brilliant masterpiece","review":"I know mant Star Trek fans might not like this show. But if you are a hard-core Star Trek fan, and just want to watch a casual show of Drama in Sci-Fi settings it is just perfect. I like it because how it manages to pull strings in your heart. I like the fact that at the end of season 2 Picard finally has found some inner peace. He has long been pending one after a life of doing missions after missions and saving others.","rating":"10\/10","date":"7 May 2022"}
{"title":"Picard is outstanding. Star Trek at its best (especially season 3)","review":"TNG was my Trek, growing up during the time it was on TV. Even though I enjoyed re-runs of TOS, it was TNG all the way for me (must add that Voyager is a close 2nd favourite). I can understand the negative reviews of the first two seasons of Picard, although I personally thoroughly enjoyed them. They work as stand alone stories and I think any viewer, regardless of prior lore knowledge, can hop straight into any one of them and be suitably entertained. I always try to take everything as it is intended, at face value, in the moment and accept that it is someone else's vision. For me, that is all part of the fun and the magic with film and TV. I recommend giving the first two seasons a go and ignore the negative reviews. Make your own mind up! However, if you want to see a follow up to Star Trek: The Next Generation in 2023 (or later), you are in for a treat with season 3 of Star Trek: Picard. I usually save up episodes to binge watch as many as I feel like, but this time I was so keen on seeing it I went old school and watched them every week. As much as I enjoyed the Next Gen movies, Picard is even better. It really felt like TNG and made me remember why I loved this show so much. I saved the last two episodes so I could watch them together and I can recommend you do the same. I always enjoyed the two part episodes way back when and these two really work like that. This is one of those shows you can really tell people had a great time making. There is an enormous amount of creative passion in there and it really shows. I give it a solid 10\/10 for season 3 alone, hands down. Fantastic job well done to all involved and just... Thank you.","rating":"10\/10","date":"22 April 2023"}
{"title":"Probably the best Star Trek series until now","review":"After the first season of Picard, I was disappointed. Sir Patric Stewart came across as an old man, no longer capable of playing the great Picard. Man was I wrong! This season has blown my mind. Sometimes a bit slow, but the way all Ster Trek history comes together in this series is unbelievable. I estimate that at least 8 storylines from previous series come together in this one (no, I will tell no spoilers) .I felt sad at the end of the last episode, but it confirmed what I always have thought: Picard has a powerful friend but just never did not see it.10 stars, while It has been long that SciFi touched me, in the way the second season did.","rating":"10\/10","date":"7 May 2022"}

The writing feels just as bad as the disney Star Wars movies.There's plotholes everywhere, and it's clear the plot wasn't planned out ahead of time. Also dear god did this show drag out it's story. This was a story that could fit into a 2 part episode of real Star Treks.I just want real thought-provoking Star Trek and not some melodrama made for teenagers.

Every episode played homage to all the previous incarnations of Star Trek that came before it.\nYou have to push through the first 20 minutes of episode 1 which is a bit slow but then it becomes the best Star Trek movie ever, but delivered in installments.\nThere is real character progression here, even though at first you might not like them, you eventually understand where all their emotional baggage comes from and then when you do, that's when 'Star Fleet' and its ideals comes back to life.","rating":"10\/10","date":"27 March 2020"}

{"title":"Just bad writing","review":"I get it, let's get away from isolated episodes. Let's make one or two story arcs that run the whole season, let's pepper in some old characters and some nostalgia.\nThe writing is God awful. Back in the day, you had a character driven story, a character would grow and as a viewer you'd grow with their experiences. But the characters now bend to the need and will of the story, rather than have the story react to how a matured and fleshed out character would react. Picard is juvenile. He allows others' weaknesses be exploited to benefit his cause.\nHe didn't want to involve his crew from the onset, because they would have said yes too easily, only to involve them anyhow later on in the season.\nThe characters aren't consistent with themselves and aren't cohesive with the others.\nI wanted to like the show, I wanted it to be the link between TNG episodic style and Discoverys run-on style, as I am not a fan of the latter. Instead Paramount shows us that it can't be original while trying to stay true to an original premise.\n\"To explore new world's, to explore human issues with a touch of sensitivity set in the future times.\"","rating":"1\/10","date":"7 March 2020"}
{"title":"Awesome new way to see Star Trek","review":"Yeah, bring back a 79 year old actor as a Sci-Fi Action Star?!?!........Well, it works!Only Picard could do this as a character. It's pretty cool to see all the ingrained Next Generation storylines like the Borg and the Cube. The Romulians(?) the way they have been depicted throughout the Next Generation show and movies. Having the original cast coming in and out and as part of the new storyline is like icing on the cake.The perspective of the show isn't centered around Star Fleet like every other series or movie. This is new to see it from the perspective of characters on the outside of it. Instead of being out in space there is a lot happening on 24th Century Earth. I like this Sci-Fi action series that is developed in the Star Trek universe but is totally different from what you would normally see.I'm 3 episodes in and I've been holed since the first shot of Picard.......and I wouldn't call myself a Trekkie by any means!","rating":"9\/10","date":"16 February 2020"}

{"title":"Two words \"Blade Runner\"","review":"I have not been looking forward to this show, not because I dislike Star Trek, nor because I dislike TNG or the actors involved, far from it. I felt that if they are bringing back loved characters it felt that the hate for shows like Discovery which I love by the way, was so great that the developers felt they had no choice but to spare no expense.And yet I feel even as early as the first episode that they failed to spend enough money of good original writers and scripts that they have done a Star Wars \"Force Awakens\" and stolen from elsewhere.The story picks up after the events of the J J Abrams Star Trek story of the destruction of Romulus. This was something I liked and could get behind, but then it goes into a Blade Runner themed naughty replicants\/synthetic humans who for some reason are involved in the destruction of the Mars colony. It does not stop there, it then goes into a plot of a top of the range replicant which has links to Data, and if you are familiar with the story of Blade Runner, like me you might start rolling your eyes.I don't wish to be a cynic but I do fear that this could ruin the Star Trek franchise and it was the fan base who demanded a new Picard\/TNG story to blame\/","rating":"3\/10","date":"30 January 2020"}
{"title":"Best Star Trek Series until now","review":"Star Trek is an integrated part of many lives so I did have high expectations to begin with. The expectation has been met and moreIgnore some of the negative comments of people. I think they simply don't understand in many ways or they are affected by the sign of our times of a growing number of people who live their lives based on a story that challenges the idea of a civilization with a religion based on a fixed ancient idea of doom and hell which sees wars and destruction as only solution versus the idea of star trek which is in line with science and the extrapolation that its very possible that life out there is artificial not human. Probably in a mix with people who are stuck in the past and don't see that also television series are part of the time and environment they were created in comparable to comics in the 80's (simpler, less complex storylines, hero, enemy, done) and comics nowadays which have multiple storylines, deep complexity and much more complexity and more realistic characters which are \"real\", not a disney princess. They simply can not handle more complex stories that is the core thing. It needs to be simple therefore references to e.g. Orville. Their brains can not handle stories like this. They are Romulans: stuck with a fixed vision, unable to change and therefore unable to undertand the message of Picard.It has multiple layers of story to think about. Both from personnel perspective as overall angles. The acting is above par. The eye for detail is astonishing. The usage of symbols is smart and it catches the essence of star trek perfectly. Better than any series around at the moment.Apart from this it was uber-fantastic to finally not see the actors on stage during a con event answering questions but they are actually on screen... cool, as a gift to loyal fans, with their personalities and in a great story with a gazillion references to the past. And this intermingles with the experience: on the stage of the con we heard that the makeup of data was irritating and the annoying lenses to wear. But the cast did it here. Instant recognition and coolness.The main idea behind the story is overall interesting in line with Nasa's expectation of intelligent life in the universe and it explores what the implications are of this. Because probably.... it is so... I'm anxious to know more about this hidden ai in a hidden dimensions and it has of course resemblences with Asimov's Foundation and the \"ending of that\": where are now all the \"robots\". Only a different twist. Who knows ... now that we are in the \"caves of steel\" at home .. maybe star trek in the end... will merge with the Asimov universe and Picard will meet R. Daneel Olivaw who left 8 suns in a certain order behind.At the same time it intertwingels with the theme of AI as probably this has never been put on screen as good as in this series. Since everyone studying AI will have \"data\" in the back of their minds. So it will have lasting impact and probably even on the conscious AI's that we WILL one day create. Will they watch this series and take away the message? Will humanity follow the views as depicted in Terminator Judgement Day or will they follow the views as Picard laid them out.And at the same time it has its own viewpoint on what will happen when we are able to copy our brain over to a virtual environment. But a much star trek answer than e.g. in Black Mirrors San Junipero. Which is another interesting viewpoint and a novel one. I really like the element of choice here and describing life and what it means and the conflict with e.g. a future where we will copy our brain in a virtual environment and live forever in a thousand different copies and environments. What will it mean.The acting is formidable, each of characters is well worked out and you are drawn in each character's reasoning and a part of their why they are what they are. You can replace yourself in each character and auto start thinking on why, who, what and how. There are dramatic moments of a drug addict mother who has a son wishes to no longer see her to moments to laugh about.The scenes are put together in an incredible detail and a a lot of love for details including e.g. the language of the butterlflies by someone who passed away and the butterflies appearing later to signify and tell a butterfly storyline.The borg's artifact, the way seven fits in this (and way cool to see her as a dramatic hero still fighting for the good in difficult conditions) is also worked out very well and it fits and touches the overall theme from yet another angle which is pretty smart and amazing that all of this fits it 10 episodes. Which adds to the overall feeling that nothing is rushed. Everything is worked out well, in details and a \"logical\" puzzle piece, as opposed to many other stories.The ending is superb, smart and all the lines click together and... it gives a new crew so I hope there will be many more new adventures with this crew. I'm going to watch this series many times more.","rating":"10\/10","date":"26 April 2020"}
{"title":"What part of this show is Star Trek?","review":"I have always loved Star Trek until Discovery, albeit I was excited to see Christopher Pike and the Enterprise again, so I stuck with it. Picard had potential, but I feel more depressed after each episode, and that's NEVER where Star Trek took us. It was all about a hopeful future. Now we have holographic ads that you have to fight off, smoking, swearing, vigilantes, a corrupt federation. Not the future of Star Trek or Gene Roddenberry. Horrible.\nI can only hope The Orville picks up the positive mantle and does Star Trek proud. Episodic and positive. Boldy go...back to Star Trek!

Are there now two Borg Queens?3. The new trans-warp conduit. What's on the other end?4. The appearance of Wesley Crusher.

{"title":"Excellent, so much more than I expected","review":"For me this show is awesome. It's all Discovery isn't.As a BIG fan of the old shows I was so dissapointed with Discovery. Uninspiring cast, prosaic and simple plot and dialogues that make my head hurt.This show is packed with nostalgia I give you that, but it's also a formidable show in it's own right.A superb cast, much more gritty and misterious sometimes ominous plot, this show embodies everything Star Trek is. It takes us on a new exciting journeys, through murky places and offers a glimpse into the unknown.I'm only halfway through the show, and already I'm super engaged and can't wait to see what happens next, on the edge of the universe.My big recommendation, this is how you do Star Trek in 2020's.","rating":"10\/10","date":"21 February 2022"}
{"title":"Sadly, this is not Star Trek","review":"When Star Trek Picard was first announced, with certain elements of earlier Star Trek seemingly coming out of hiding, I was hopeful that with this TV series, we could leave behind the awful mess that was Kelvin timeline movies and Discovery, and get back some proper Star Trek.Sadly, this is not what Star Trek Picard is, in fact, it's not Star Trek at all.\nGene Roddenberry created the Star Trek universe as this utopia of the human race having developed into something better, more enlightened people, and thus creating this future that is positive, hopeful and inspiring. Stories based on that were uplifting, even when dark and difficult topics were the subject of an episode or movie. Gene's vision was a future that was positive and inspiring, something that the writing and production ALWAYS reflected, right up until Star Trek Enterprise ended in 2005.\nWe remember, Star Trek The Next Generation and Deep Space Nine featured some of the best story telling in TV history, while action sequences were always a tool to emphasise story and drama in an intelligent way.\nAnd we also remember the wonderful production design and visual experience that was beautifully crafted and consistent from 1979 up until 2005. You immediately recognised Star Trek and it made you feel right at home.Then came JJ Abrams and Alex Kurtzman, destroying all of the above with their first Star Trek movie in 2009, dumbing it down heavily and changing the theme to an action-based, depressing franchise, continued with Star Trek Discovery. And Alex Kurtzman has done just that with Star Trek Picard. It is nothing more than Discovery in disguise, like they realised that Star Trek fans were not going to like it, thus injecting some well-known TNG universe prop or tune here and there.\nBut it doesn't help, even the great Sir Patrick Stewart can't correct the mess that Kurtzman has created.Yes the overall idea of a story based around the character of Bruce Maddox is intriguing. But then the writing around it is awful at best:Romulans: The producers and writers of Picard must have never watched any Star Trek prior to 2009, because Romulans in this series are nothing like the race we see in the TNG era. They don't act, talk or look like the Romulans we knew. In Picard, Romulans behave, act, talk and look like egocentric humans, just with pointy ears.Starfleet: The members of Starfleet we meet in Picard act nothing like it was established back in the TNG era. Instead, everyone is just making stupid decisions and acting only in their self-interest. No trace whatsoever of the enlightened organisation that had exploration at its core.Visual experience and production design: Alex Kurtzman once again completely disposed of all the careful work that was done by Rick Sternbach, Mike Okuda or Michael Westmore. Picard does not look nor feel like the Star Trek we all loved prior to the arrival of JJ Abrams. Ship design, prop design, no trace of that grand Star Trek universe we once knew. Starships, arguably one of the most important things in a Star Trek setting, look NOTHING like the skilled work created by Okuda\/Sternbach, no trace of Starfleet, Federation or Romulan DNA in them.Writing: It is awful. It is NOT uplifting and optimistic, at all, and it does not have science and exploration at its core, in fact none of the values established by Gene Roddenberry. It's simply depressing and superficial story-telling.As I had written above, this is simply another iteration of Discovery, with all its bad characteristics and decisions made by Alex Kurtzman and inspired by JJ Abrams. This is not Star Trek.\nI want proper Star Trek back, you know the one invented by Roddenberry, and ever so skilfully executed by people like Rick Sternbach, Mike Okuda, Michael Westmore, Rick Berman, Ronald D Moore or Ira Steven Behr. The one that is intelligent, beautiful and optimistic, exploring the galaxy with science at its core.","rating":"1\/10","date":"9 February 2020"}

{"title":"When you've seen the trailers, you've seen it all. Another crapfest like Discovery.","review":"As a long time Star Trek fan, I was excited to see Jean-Luc Picard back in action. I was sceptical at first and especially after having seen the Star Trek: Discovery crapfest. But I was still hopeful and I figured they can't mess it up twice.. But they did.. and Star Trek: Picard in many aspects is very much worse than Discovery.As with Discovery, the creators managed to destroy everything we've come to like, know and cherish. Again, their inflated ego's are so big, that they just can't build on what has been built already. No, they figure that what they thought of is better.But it is not. It really is not better at all.Stuff that is wrong:Romulans are not Romulans anymore. They got butchered as bad as the Klingons in Discovery. Romulans now wield swords and they are either an elf, a ninja, or Irish humans with pointy ears. Makes sense? No indeed it does not.Sunglasses and vaping, to make clear to the viewer we are dealing with people who are cool and\/or edgy. It doesn't get more juvenile than that. Not to mention the sheer lack of imagination here.Female 1 to female 2: \"oh look at him, he's so hot\". Ah, it did get more juvenile.JL. JL. JL. More JL. Who is this JL? It's definitely not Jean-Luc PIcard, because he would never accept or appreciate this, no matter what happened in the last 20 years that magically exists.Females in power everywhere, and they're either nasty, a harlot, or both. The misandry is astounding if you care to look for it.Not a single one of the characters is likeable. NONE. Not even Picard is likeable, who has done nothing but feel shame for 4 episodes and being whipped around like a drunk ensign by nearly everyone in his vicinity, most notably females. But let's face it, this isn't Jean-Luc Picard we're looking at, as another reviewer already aptly pointed out; it's Patrick Stewart, playing himself.All the holograms on the ship are really annoying.Modern day political crap everywhere and everything is dark, dreary, gloomy and depressing. If I want to see more of that, I'll hop on Twitter or watch the news. We don't need this here, at all. What the hell happened to positive, uplifting and hopeful Star Trek? Stuff changes, sure, but when you change certain particular stuff, it loses its identity and in this case stops being Star Trek. The whole premise of this happening to Starfleet is beyond stupid and unbelievable to begin with.Acting performances (and the dialogue) are really bad. Not even Stewart manages to pull off a good performance consistently.The swearing. I don't care about it normally, but I do feel that swearing is a sign of weakness. It never has had a place in Star Trek. There is no reason whatsoever to include it now. If you think you need swearing to make a certain point for a character you created, your lack of skill and imagination is astonishing.Pacing. It's off, really off. I have no problem with a slowburner, but this is not that. This is more likely an astounding lack of content for 10 episodes. When you've seen the trailer, you've basically seen everything noteworthy that happened so far, I'm not even joking.They didn't want to make a reunion show. Yet, the only good things that happened so far is the nostalgia: seeing Data, a glimpse of the old Enterprise and we know we're going to see Riker, Troi and Seven. Take all that away, remove the Star Trek logo and we're left with a crappy sci-fi show that would never have seen the light of day otherwise.I could list more, a lot more, but I'm done. This show sucks, it's so woke it hurts and does not deserve the Star Trek label. What a disappointment. 3\/10.","rating":"3\/10","date":"15 February 2020"}
{"title":"Great? No. But good? Yeah!","review":"I consider myself a Trekkie, but not a Trekker. Meaning, I grew up on Star Trek and I made a point of seeing every movie (TOS and TNG). But I don't go to conventions and I'm not deep into the lore. I didn't watch all of DS9 or Voyager. Barely touched Enterprise or anything after that. But I just recently decided to check out Picard. And I liked it! Yes, it's different than other Star Treks. It's grittier (there's f-bombs!), slower, more methodical. And I dig it. Patrick Stewart is great, and occasionally compelling (not as much as he was in Logan though). But it's a fun look at what might have become of Picard and the old crew. What might have come of the Federation. Is each season basically one long drawn out episode? Yeah, it totally is. But I was still into it. Did I love it? No. But did I really enjoy it. Yeah!

I smiled when Seven of Nine appeared.\nIt is a different format to what die-hards might like, but that is not necessarily a bad thing.

{"title":"Why The Negativity?","review":"At first glance, I was amazed at all of the negative reviews for this series. Then I remembered that Star Trek TNG was just as hated as this series when it was first launched. It wasn't the same as the original Star Trek, so people loathed it. After a couple of years, people began to warm up to it. The same thing happened with Deep Space Nine. At first people hated it but now it is generally regarded as the best of all the Star Trek series.That being said, this series is different. It is much darker than even DS9. Most of the characters are new. However, the plot is consistent with the overall ST canon. There are even elements of Battlestar Galactica in this series, which I found compelling. I could even see a tie-in with that series in the future if they were not produced by competing companies. And, it was a mystery that continued to unfold throughout the ten episodes.Generally, I think most people dislike this series because it wasn't what they expected. Most people expected a continuation of The Next Generation, even though the producers said up front that it wouldn't be. Personally, I love the possibilities with this series. This crew could have some seriously interesting adventures.I liked it and I say give it some time and we may see a lot more people jump on the bandwagon as they did with other shows in the Star Trek franchise.","rating":"9\/10","date":"8 May 2020"}

{"title":"True Star Trek, much better than Discovery - especially season 3!","review":"Season 3 update: Just awesome! Darker than the older series, but so well done, absolutely great, an epic and honorable ending! Loved to see all the old actors and the new ones look promising, too.Season 2 update: Actually, the weakest part of the whole show, but still good Stark Trek, in the original spirit.The beginning - Season 1 (main review):\nMany people starting to watch the show seem to be negatively overwhelmed by the dark, burdensome atmosphere presented early on, get frustrated and quit. Well, it is somewhat understandable if you just expect the next generation (TNG) style from the start, but sadly these people fail to discover the impressive _real_ development and the deeper meaning of the whole first season - which truly is a great piece of film making! (I say this as a classic fan of The Next Generation, Deep Space 9, Voyager, Enterprise...)For instance to quote one of those unfortunately failed reviews in my view: \"Star Trek Corrupted ... of the 5 episodes aired so far, I'm giving up on it.\" - Please come back and see the real brightness of the true Star Trek, which unfolds in the excellent last episodes! You should really understand that light comes after darkness! Do not give up. Without giving away much details (no spoiler): The show IS much about overcoming dark times, the federation being somehow corrupted etc., a bit like we have already seen dark sides of the federation in the late seasons of DS9.Picard offers great characters and different perspectives, much deeper than the flat figures in Discovery for instance. You get good acting, many nice details, modern visuals and a really classic Trek feel (just darker at the start than usual). The storyline features intelligent twists and a meaningful psychology. Basically my only critique is that the pacing is a bit too slow in the first episodes, but that is a minor point overall. For me the first season of Picard really connects to the great times of Next Generation if you watch it to the end. The ending is marvellous and clears the way to a \"classic style\" new Enterprise-like season in my opinion.Engage!","rating":"9\/10","date":"10 May 2020"}

{"title":"Entertaining, even beautiful continuation and omage to Next Generation and Voyager","review":"An exciting, extremely well acted show which stands on its own, but also serves as a wonderful omage to Star Trek the Next Generation and Star Trek Voyager, while also being a direct sequel to both. There is also a moment about 21 minutes into Season 2 episode 10 which makes Picard a pre\/sequel to the original Trek.And the latter connections to pre-Discovery Star Trek show one of the primary reasons Picard is so good, and infinitely better than the new Paramount+ \"Star Trek\" series: it appreciates and extends that universe. Picard is canon, not in a limiting, overly-reverential way, but in a fun, clever, and respectful way. Discovery cannibalizes Star Trek and uses it as fodder for subpar, insultingly non-cannon storytelling. Picard loves the true Star Trek universe. Discovery is just a cynical attempt to cash it on it.Patrick Stewart was intimately involved with the development of the storyline, and decisions about what this show would and would not be. It is obvious that everyone involved in the production has a great deal of respect for the material and the Star Trek universe. You can believe everything I've said above and ignore those reviewers claiming that Star Trek Picard is not canon. It is absolutely rooted in the Star Trek canon. I also suggest you ignore those who are giving the show low reviews because of its politics. One reviewer even claims the show is anti-white, which is patently absurd given that the lead character is, um, white.I wish I could describe the elements which make this show even more wonderful than it might have otherwise been, but they would be significant spoilers. Suffice it to say there were several moments when I exclaimed out loud, \" Holy sh**!\" I had completely avoided reading anything about Star Trek Picard so as to avoid spoilers, and so if you have managed to do so you are in for some wonderful surprises if you are a fan of Next Generation and Voyager.","rating":"9\/10","date":"23 August 2020"}

Who was it for, or aimed at?It wasn't for TNG fans, or Star Trek fans, it wasn't made to reclaim the Star Trek name after the dumpster fire of Discovery, and it wasn't to attract new viewers to the franchise.As far as I can tell it exists to push a political agenda by a person or group who have no idea how politics, or marketing, or viewership ratings, or writing workInstead, I reckon, they are assuming that being woke will somehow drive up subscriptions, instead of turning potential viewers off, by pandering to a tiny minority of a tiny minority of a tiny minority, who won't watch this show anyway, while actively not having anything to attract anyone else, which is not a valid marketing strategy.Maybe I read too much into this absolute rubbish after I watched a few episodes and stopped watching, and I only watched 3 episodes in the vain hope it was simply a terrible pilot instead of a terrible pilot which accurately showed how bad the rest of the show was.","rating":"1\/10","date":"30 August 2020"}

It's like a cosy, warm reminisce at times. And something new and exciting at others. Putting that aside, it was a great watch, with a great story and great acting. I do feel the production let it down ever so slightly at times. Was this screen-time or money constraints?? I just felt certain scenes would have benefitted from more time and attention to detail. They felt rushed. I won't say which as it may just be me and I don't want to include spoilers in my review. Would I recommend it? Hell yes!!!","rating":"10\/10","date":"27 March 2020"}
{"title":"Redpillers are the worst","review":"It's not a 10\/10 show but the redpillers in here mass thumbs downing positive reviews are obnoxious.Gene Roddenberry would have been mad about the violence and cynicism, but I think he would have approved the overall direction of the show. There is some very intelligent writing and its nice to see CBS embrace Patrick Stewart and the idea that Star Trek is primarily about exploration, philosophy, camaraderie, and examining the human condition. In Discovery, they gave us a bunch of bad writing, big flashy space battles, and dumb villains. This show has some rough patches and a lot of violence, but Patrick Stewart is still a great actor, and Michael Chabon obviously knows how to write good science fiction.","rating":"10\/10","date":"14 March 2020"}

What made Star Trek great was that it showed a glimmer of hope for humanity, but the sophisticated liberal culture warriors can't allow that to continue. In their brilliance they took something good and ruined it, because anything that is good is beneath them. Utterly pathetic. I have been a Trek fan for nearly 50 years. That's done now.

{"title":"Thankfully this is not the Star Trek you remember","review":"I continue to be a huge fan of all ST but All things must evolve , why would we want another next gen or voyager etc ?I find Picard to be well tied to the ST universe and lore , visually it looks good and represents a side of earth we haven't spent much time with over all the Star Trek franchise. ie non Starfleet.This how ever maybe a issue for some Fans expecting more of the same. I found in the first ep if i focused on Picard he showed me a man regretting his choices of the past 14 years but had tried to adapt and find happiness.........but failed. The CAPTAIN was still there but just under the skin . I have great respect for Patrick Stewards personal sacrifices for his art , he truly is a great actor.Ive only seen the first 3 eps but look forward to following JLS story and as a bonus i have the overall story arc to watch as well.","rating":"8\/10","date":"10 February 2020"}

I'm enjoying that Picard is no longer the nice guy. Yes hes now finally doing something worthwhile, but only after 20 years of sulk and misery, ignoring everyone and everything he once loved. This highlights the impossibly saint like federation as something that has given into fear, mirroring our own \"federations\". People are saying it's slow, but which Star Trek series didnt have slow and boring episodes!? I personally havent found any episodes boring yet, but i suppose it depends what you were looking for, and which trek you were expecting with a 70 year old lead!

{"title":"To much hate here people! It's an awesome show.","review":"So many low ratings!. Not really deserved, but I understand peoples emotional attachment to the series. People struggle with changing anything in the trek universe, and no doubt when TNG came out, people where out with pitch forks saying whats this rubbish.. when comparing it to the original Star Trek.This show has had so much time, effort and thought put into it.. its simply awesome. Anyone who has watched previous Star Trek series a lot, will see all the little snippets of old, spliced throughout the series, from the music.. through to com badges and many more.The Actors and Characters are awesome! The new characters are realistic and cool, and all have an interesting back story. How the writers and team linked this series to the past while moving forward was simply stunning. They have honoured so much of old while moving forward.Guys, I recommend you rewatched the original TNG at the same time as the new series, and put all these amazing pieces together.Thanks Patrick Stewart, and all the team for making this happen.. you can tell this show will sprout many more spin off series with so many interesting characters.The only reason I haven't given this 9 instead of 10, is that I must agree with the swearing... to much guys, people in the 24th century don't need to use base language so much as humanity has evolved!.","rating":"9\/10","date":"16 February 2020"}

{"title":"Great series!","review":"I was reading the negative reviews and really have to wonder why so negative? I love the main Star Trek movies and series (no deep space 9 crap or those types) and find this new series quite entertaining. It wouldn't be Star Trek if you didn't occasionally wish they didn't say or do something (and when did we bring back swearing and smoking?) but cmon Patrick Stewart is unreal and this is a well developed series. I've talked to friends who also love it and in a time of binge watching kind of wish I could watch multiple episodes but I admit I do look forward to next week like I did the xfiles. Thanks for getting this series and the cast back together I think it's great! And whoever posted about the fake 10s which I gave the show I hope that didn't happen. It delegitimizes my 10! Really bad if true but I don't rate much and I enjoy the show.","rating":"9\/10","date":"8 February 2020"}
{"title":"What is life all about?","review":"I did not grow up appreciating the original Star Trek TV series. Hence, I do not qualify to identify myself as a Trekkie. I, however, managed to catch up Star Trek: The Next Generation when it made its way to the terrestrial TV channels. I remember the series not as much of an action-packed series but more of a cerebral one discussing life issues. I never did follow the ensuing Trek series or the silver screen productions. So, to me, Picard is only Starfleet Captain that I know.More than a decade after his last mission and his unceremonious departure from USS Enterprise, Admiral Picard has to go to back to space. He does this clandestinely against the orders of the authorities, with a ragtag assembly of crew and space ship. In his previous mission, Data had caused the destruction of Mars. Because of that, androids, or synthetics as they were known in 2399, were banned. Picard had resigned in protest.Enjoying his retirement in his chateau, Picard comes to know of a girl who may be the 'daughter' of Data as she was developed from Data's positronic brain. She is, unfortunately, assassinated. There is a vast conspiracy, from the Romulans mainly, as they had to bear the bunt of USS Enterprise's destruction of Mars earlier, to wipe out all synthetics. Picard's mission is to find Data's other twin daughter and save all synthetics from annihilation.Keeping with the characters who are all senior citizens trying to save the Universe, the series progresses slowly with a lot of dialogue and intellectual discourse.The last two episodes are the most exciting part of the season for an occasional Star Trek fan like me. Perhaps at that time, earthlings have eradicated poverty and abated their fixation for material wealth, their discussions seem to focus more philosophical issues. People still try to create schisms and have pre-conceived ideas about 'the other' even though he never had the chance to meet or interact with them. They fail to realise that all these animosities will eventually cause self-destruction. Is it necessary for species to kill each other to survive? Is sacrifice the highest form of deed one can offer to a fellow kind? Is there logic in sacrifice or is life too precious to be wasted?The finale discusses death and purpose of life. The past is already written. The future is for us to pen. How is the narration going to be? It is fear and suspicion of the unknown, which is the destroyer. Is believing that openness may allay these problems naive? To say that we do not have the choice is indicative of our lack of imagination. We are beyond all these. Our collective intellectual should be able to overcome adversities.Being alive is not a licence to indulge. It is not a choice, but it comes with specific responsibilities. It is the price we have to pay for building consciousness. It expects us to think for the future. Mortality gives meaning to our time on Earth. Developing peace, friendship and love help us to appreciate the gift of life. At the end of our lifetime, we are left with only memories.","rating":"8\/10","date":"2 May 2020"}

{"title":"Awful. Awful. Awful.","review":"I've always been a big admirer of Patrick Stewart THE ACTOR ever since I was a kid. I think he's immensely talented. But Patrick Stewart THE MAN is way too cliche ultra Hollywood liberal and super woke for me. I'm afraid that he had too much input into how this Picard series would be written (in order to get him to reprise his role) and this is one of the main reasons why this show resemble anything like TNG.That being said.....I've made it through 4 agonizingly boring and woke episodes and so far the ONLY scene that has been even remotely interesting is the very first one where you see the old Enterprise D, 10 Forward, and Picard and Data playing poker. IMO the makeup\/CGI they used on Data (Brent Spiner) was fantastic. He looked almost exactly like he did playing Data in the 90's on TNG. Even though the scene was only like 3 minutes long, it made me feel a brief level of nostalgia that brought me back to when I was a kid watching TNG in the 90's. After this scene however, the show basically goes off a cliff.\nThe authoritarian Picard you know from TNG is long gone. All that is left is a frail old man who gets pushed around by one woman to the next.\nThe \"Romulans\" are almost completely unrecognizable as the Romulans we know from TNG days. I literally (no joke) fell asleep halfway through both episode 3 and 4. The show is awful. I definitely and legitimately feel duped into purchasing the CBS all access subscription.","rating":"3\/10","date":"18 February 2020"}
{"title":"WATCH and Enjoy !","review":"Watch and enjoy!Another Excellent job continuing the Star Trek world with yet another very fun and imaginative story.If you wish your SYFY to be more complex, elaborate or like Neal Stephenson's Cryptonomicon, you're in luck. You can have both (I love deep SYFY as much as anyone), but don't overlook the value in a fun TV series that entertains and allows you smile and enjoy.I see many negative reviews here. Speaking as someone who watched the original Kirk and Spock version as a youngster, while sitting on the floor in front of a newly color tv, the Star Trek world has always been my favorite SYFY storyline.Wonderful Character development that leads us to love the characters (well, despising some--by design), but always.....always....we see and enjoy a storyline set among the stars--on some distant planet (or the Federation's home base-Earth). Yes, Star Trek stories often have happy endings, and often (as in Season 2 of Picard) are more unexpected than you'd think.There's nothing wrong with that. In today's world we could all use some happy endings.Nitpick if you must, but you can't ruin this for me, and hopefully not for anyone deciding if they'll watch or not.I hope this series continues as long as it can, and will be followed by another then another then another. Simply continuing to live long and prosper.","rating":"10\/10","date":"24 July 2022"}
{"title":"Familiarity Spurs Believability","review":"Here are my impressions, a review of sorts, of the series.Firstly, I have always loved Patrick Stewart, in any role he has played but by far my favourite is Jean-Luc Picard. I watched Star Trek:The Next Generation when it premiered in the '80s and while not my favourite in the Star Trek Universe it has some of my favourite characters. That being said, Picard opened slowly. Patrick Stewart is old, and that reflected upon Picard. (Hindsight, maybe that was intentional). The first three episodes moved very slowly as character, plot, and setting development were all introduced. It felt a bit disjointed and we were unclear what three story line aspects were the focus of the storyboard and which characters we were supposed to fall in love with. After the third, um fourth episode, things moved a bit quicker though the plot still was a bit disjointed; at least we had a clearer understanding of the objective.\nSecondly, I loved the introduction of former cast members of ST:TNG. Deanna Troi and Will Riker were fan favs of mine along with Data, Seven of Nine, and even Hugh. I would have liked to see where the Star Trek Universe would have taken Wesley Crusher but ... continuing. I had forgotten about Deanna and Riker's on again\/off again trists in the original NG series. It was nice to see them together. As for the newly introduced characters. I liked Cristobal Rios though I do believe Santiago Carbrera plays all his roles too similarly, think Taz on Salvation or Santos on Transformers. And I was thrilled to see Michelle Hurd in the show. Her character was totally believable and real. The cast, old and new, worked well together and complimented each other nicely. In the end I fell in love with each of the \"crew\" members and look forward to the continuing voyages of Picard.\nThirdly (is that a word?), the slow beginning to develop characters, plot, and setting was crucial for the last four episodes (7, 8, 9a, and 9b). I so loved the course of the series and understood the mindset of each and every character. It is important to know why a character is where s\/he is and why s\/he is there and Picard explained that nicely. For me. It was shown here in Germany on Armed Forces Network from episode 1 to 9b as a binge watch which concluded at 0400 Monday morning! Eek. And though I told myself at 0100 that I was going to bed I just could not stop watching (you cannot record AFN). The show was speeding along, I fell for each character and had a need to know what would happen next. I was not disappointed. I did \"know\" inevitabilities and outcomes before the show ended but did not know exactly the \"how to get there\" details and I was moved to tears throughout the season two-part finale. The wrap up was exactly as it should be for a Star Trek Universe series, which has always maintained \"a hopeful future\".\nConcluding, the entire 10 shows felt like it should have been shown on the big screen as a movie. There was an intensity about the series that just felt like a movie, to me. I appreciate the small screen approach though which proved invaluable for character development. The closing scene I sat and thought, \"what a great movie, this would make for an incredible series\" almost totally forgetting that this was a series. Well done and hats off to the writers and directors. I am a huge fan of this \"crew\" and look forward to their \"continuing mission\".","rating":"9\/10","date":"29 June 2020"}
{"title":"Picard With Nostalgia For The Future","review":"History does repeat itself.. And so do human qualities like greed, narrow-mindedness, treachery.. The people who complain that this series isn't as 'hopeful' as the earlier Star Trek sagas seem to forget that this basic principle will still apply no matter what future we eventually reach.. However, the story is rounded up fairly at the end with an ample serving of hope, sacrifice and beleif in the human ability to be a better civilization, both morally and technologically.. And it was wonderful to see the old NG crew make special appearances.. A fitting continuum..","rating":"8\/10","date":"17 May 2020"}

{"title":"Lifeless and dull","review":"It's just like basically every non-bot or humanoid here said. This doen't have much to do with the original TNG show universe. Which might be okay, if it at least tonally resembled Roddenberry's vision. But no, it is exactly like you would imagine a generic semi-dark sci fi show, with poverty, drug addiction, racism, ridiculous violence and so on.The writing feels hasty and lazy at the same time. But the writers seem to be full of themselves, because although I agree with all the messages, I feel like the show insulted my intelligence by shoving them down my throat. What's worse than this: If they had only stayed with ST future communism, they would have taken a swing at alt right libertarians like they wanted to, and given old fans the optimistic vision they had always loved.It's a show for nobody.","rating":"1\/10","date":"7 March 2020"}

{"title":"Feeling seriously let down","review":"I was so excited about this series coming out. The first episode seemed to have promise, but between the continued development of bitter, dark, and angry characters so unlike the ones I knew in TNG, way more hard core profanity than any other ST show or movie, and the gratuitous violence that disgusted us last week, we are pretty much done.

{"title":"The best Star Trek that you will ever see.","review":"I don't mean the best ever, but there will never be another Star Trek made better than this. Look, I would like nothing more than a next generation reboot, with all the original cast who were willing; if I was a billionaire, I'd probably fund it myself. Unfortunately I am not a billionaire and the people who run TV for a living have decided that the TNG cast is played out and it's time for something new, I don't agree but that's where we find ourselves.This is far and away better than discovery, better than Voyager, and it's not saying much but it's infinitely better than the JJ Abrams movies.I watch negative review videos and read the written reviews and comments etc and I see a lot of grasping for straws, people being hyper critical and but picking any little thing they can find to complain about...and I get it. TNG was so good and Captain Picard was such a great, larger than life character..the standard is very high..it would be almost impossible to meet the standard we hope for.. knowing this and knowing a lot of people would be highly critical, they decided to try anyway.On the most important element, the critical element, they got it right. Picard is still Picard, unlike Disney making Like Skywalker not be Like Skywalker, Picard is still Picard. We know that Picard would have fiercely advocated for aiding the Romulans, he would have opposed harsh and draconian restrictions on synthetic life. If the Romulans were facing a cataclysm and needed help and Starfleet told Picard to go pound sand, he absolutely would have tossed his combadge at them and told them to shove it. Picard would absolutely be bored sitting around the vineyard. Picard would absolutely want to get to the bottom of this story and find out what's going on with the synthetics and the Romulans...This is the same man we know and love.Unfortunately things have changed from the 90s, you can't put out the same product and expect it to be a success. People today have 0.4 second attention spans, at any one time they have 2-4 screens competing for their brain's attention.While this is not perfect and doesn't quite meet TNG or DS9 standard of awesomeness, it's as good as it's ever going to get. Enjoy this because any future series, if there are any, will be worse.","rating":"9\/10","date":"3 February 2020"}

Glad to say I'm now hooked for the foreseeable future. In episode 3 everything comes together to kick off the adventure properly, and the closing scene is Picard saying \"engage\", followed by a shot of his ship going off into warp drive.

{"title":"Season 3 - wow just wow","review":"Season 3 is nostalgia and decadence all rolled into one. Quiet possibly the greatest single season of Star Trek ever made.Season 1 and 2 are very missable but I was apprehensive about season 3 having not scene any spoilers and with it being the last season and my oh my they go out with a bang.Reliving my childhood with familiar faces that bought back so many good memories growing up.Season 3 continues to make you want to watch the next episode and the next and the next after that. You don't have to look so hard and just sit back and enjoy the ride and it's one hell of a ride.It's good to have the classic Star Trek back on our screens one more time but hopefully not for the last time.","rating":"10\/10","date":"22 April 2023"}
{"title":"Music overlays ouch! - but great story and filmmaking","review":"Heavy handed music overlay puts a damper on a great series excellently written. Why are we navigating through loads of soundtrack while trying to listen to an excellent story.Do I need to be driven in an emotionally musical direction in every scene? Tone it down, the show is well shot and great. Still much better then Discovery, as those shortfalls are being the loopy music, jagged camera, and story unevenness.I don't mind the new 'advanced' production style, but if you do that, you need to micro-manage in post much better to avoid distractions. And a poor mix.","rating":"8\/10","date":"5 July 2022"}
{"title":"Season 1 3* Season 2 3* Season 3 10*+","review":"I sort of enjoyed season 1 and 2 and the new characters brought in. But season 3 is absolutely what we needed, it's so sad the all three seasons were not done like this. I smiled, laughed and I was immersed in the story and action. The nostalgia was so good for anyone who watched the next generation series, with the characters we all know mostly being contradictions of their younger self's. Worf being more feeling, Data being nearly fully human, it's a great season. Hopefully they change their minds and give us more. If not I'm already looking forward to the set up of a possible future Star Trek series in episode 10 with seven of nine as Captain.","rating":"10\/10","date":"22 April 2023"}
{"title":"I'm laughing at all the haters!","review":"When Star Trek TNG came out in 1987, diehard TOS fans were appalled by the fact that there was a Klingon officer, a touchy-feely ships' counselor, children on the enterprise, etc. I suppose that the haters think the producers of TV shows should turn out the same old stuff. What they don't understand is that these people want to create something new. Not rehash something old.

No. Instead, the Paparazzi are back! We have Race wars, wars with the machines as per usual, wars with each other, wars.. wars .. WARS. We get it.. USA is trying to brain wash more WAR into people. Because they are obsessed with trying to prove they are better than everyone else!The trouble is that this doesn't connect with the younger generation. Who are desperate for intelligent writing.

{"title":"Ok...i guess.","review":"I would not call myself a Trekkie, but i have seen a good bit of TNG, DS9, V and E. So happy to see Picard again :) and i kind of like the more modern feel. Good old Picard.There are questions though. How did a post-scarcity, Kardashev 1.4 Federation in 30 years manage to fall to the level of 2nd rate trash civ like Bajorans or Ferengi? I'd like to hear the story. So far the only pathway to that failure i can see is cocksure, shortsighted admirals actually losing a war they were not even aware they were fighting, a cold spy war against a much higher motivated Romulan remnant who brought Federation down as a revenge for reluctance in the supernova incident.Also folks, do everyone a favour and please beam Lt Mary Sue back to Marvel universe where a literally flawless, all powerful, scientist-supersoldier-main romantic cardboard cutout non-character would maybe feel less lonely, more at home and could enjoy the company of her own kin.There is an intangible something i still like about the series though (most likely Patrick Stewart but maybe something else too) - if it turns out actually interesting i promise i will edit this to 7. 8 will be hard but i'll keep an open mind ;)","rating":"8\/10","date":"31 January 2020"}
{"title":"The antidepressant gone down the drain","review":"Picard is a dystopian science fiction series. It has very little to do with the original intention behind the whole Star Trek idea.It is so funny and quite sad actually that when Patrick Stewart announced in 2018 that he will be back as Picard, someone left a comment (with thousands of likes) which said: TNG IS A LEGIT ANTIDEPRESSANT.People who made ST-P just don't get it. But I am most surprised at Mr.Stewart for deciding to participate in this. Obviously he doesn't get it as well.You must understand that most people watched Star Trek for these reasons;\nIt was intended to explore the better part of ourselves, to get back in that awe state many of us lost when we left our childhoods. To come closer to the beautiful and glorious vastness of space.\nTo learn compassion and respect for every form of life. To stay hopeful. To get rid of our negative thoughts, which are basic part of our human mind. Hence STAR TREK really was the true antidepressant.But this is none of that.I gave two for the mere technical work everyone did, but otherwise, skip this if you understand and enjoy the original message of Star Trek.","rating":"2\/10","date":"29 February 2020"}

Picard is now a retired old man who initially didn't want to go out and save the world. Some return characters are aging yes, but so what. Discrimination should have no place here. If you're after young beautiful people to drool over then maybe look elsewhere for your entertainment.

It's hard to describe what it's like to see the cast of The Next Generation play together again, to see that crew reunited. You don't just like it a lot, you love it!!! It's like...being at home or coming home again and feeling safe and comfortable, and having the most fun of your life. It surprises me that a film \/ TV project has gotten such an emotional impact on me. And now I just want it to continue. Forever. Wouldn't you like to create an absolute monument with another 5 seasons and 100 episodes. As long as the actors and everyone involved can and wants to. I see endless possibilities for all sorts of plot and storylines. But even so, this crew could play whatever they want. 10 episodes just at the poker table...I'd be happy with that. The main thing is that they are there and playing together.But please include the \"Q\". It's beyond me that some fans don't like this character that much. For me, it's one of the most exciting movie characters that was ever created. Please, let the crew of \"The Next Generation\" fly on!","rating":"10\/10","date":"22 April 2023"}

{"title":"I love the Star Trek series... until now.","review":"Captain Picard is in the top-2 for Star Trek characters all-time... until they turned him into a whiney old man who lost all command of the world around him. The story is supposed to be just 20 years into the future of Star Trek TNG, but it is all CLEARLY light years ahead in terms of technology. Not to mention the story is thin and clearly just thrown together in a weak attempt to make some money off the Picard name.I watched 2.5 episodes and then hard passed on any further torture. Not worth the time or effort it takes to watch this... as it reminds me of what Disney has done to the Star Wars series.","rating":"1\/10","date":"3 June 2020"}
{"title":"Season 1 Was Good but Season 2 Was Fantastic!!","review":"If you're a Next Gen fan who loved Q then Season 2 will be you're favorite! The Easter eggs and references drawn from Star Trek: The Next Generation are almost seamless and appear to somehow make total sense even 30 years later! Some things that were referenced in Next Gen somehow seem to directly effect Picard as if Picard was written first. It's honestly masterfully done with precision! I was incredibly impressed! The presence of Q, Guinan, time travel, etc was like watching everything I love about Doctor Who mixed with Star Trek! The acting is fantastic and the writing is great! I watched Season 2 in 3 days and couldn't stop watching! So if you're a Next Gen fan I highly recommend Picard! And again, bravo to Season 2!","rating":"10\/10","date":"12 May 2022"}
{"title":"The first season finale is a statement about the show","review":"The show isn't terrible... it's certainly better than Discovery. There are some speeches that are positively Trek of old. The guest appearances are a lot of fun. It's nice to play in the TNG universe again.The problem is it's still not that good. Star Trek used to be a family show, but it has been taken by adults that are selfish and want to play with it. I found TNG so formative in my life and so full of hope that it's sad that kids won't get that these days.The end episode is a travesty. They kill off Picard, and replace him with an artificial husk with his memories. A copy at best. Create something and slap the name Picard on it and hope no one notices.Oh wait, that sounds familiar... slap Star Trek on it and hope no one notices.It's fitting, I guess.","rating":"2\/10","date":"27 March 2020"}
{"title":"Brilliant","review":"If you are expecting an episode of Star Trek you will be disappointed. Yes there are episodes of action, but they are not central to the plot.This is a story about life, love, meaning and memory.Enjoy it for what it is. It is a beautifully crafted complex story with many threads and subplots. I needed to watch it twice to fully appreciate how the threads were woven together.The writers had the courage to boldly go into a long story about personality and purpose. It helps if you watch the entire series as a binge rather than once a week. It helps you to remember all the threads and how they matter later on in the story.Picard steps outside the usual audience categories, so I am sure some people will hate it. So who is this series aimed at? It is for people who want more than the standard pigeonholed scriptwriting.The scriptwriting is complemented by wonderful cinematography.I think that this is the most entertaining and enjoyable series I have seen for over a year. I look forward to seeing what these writers do next.","rating":"10\/10","date":"18 May 2022"}

Sure it has some plots holes, poor writing and sub par dialogues but it still captured the essence of what star trek orignally was.All the actors are capable of playing the roles they are assigned and main story develops beautifully. Continuing it would be a mistake though. Should just be a mini-series","rating":"9\/10","date":"24 June 2020"}
{"title":"So glad to see Picard","review":"First and foremost most of the negative reviews here were written before the show even aired. I mean fir months people have complained that Data doesn't look the same that's because Brent's isnt a friggin young man anymore and his faced changed! Lol Apparently last week so called fans began shaking their fists at the sky cuz Patrick said it's not the Next Generation anymore and I saw many comments saying he killed Trek and it's not TNG anymore. One would think that's obvious since the show is not called The Next Generation Returns, i say grow up it's not 85-91 anymore people everything changes even a tv show about the future. I could write a much longer review about other things but it would amount to a short story.As for the good this show had an excellent start. From the costumes, the sets and the CGI are all of course top notch and it looked more like a movie than a show. It was so great to see Patrick back as Picard and Brent as Data. Im sure everyone knows the plot so I don't need to get into that. Id say the only weak thing was the opening theme, it wasnt horrible and its way better than Enterprise's but I won't be humming it anytime soon. TNG was a big part of my childhood. My uncle who loved Trek as much as I do we would talk about it after every episode. Sadly he passed away last year so I hope wherever he is he gets to watch the show on a giant tv today. Don't listen to the people who were determined to hate this show before it started and watch and decide for yourself.","rating":"9\/10","date":"23 January 2020"}

It seems clear to me that the showrunners and writers of this show are making Star Trek into something that it's not. The Trek pre 2009 depicted a future of hope but this show along with Discovery is just so depressing.

Judging by looking the first 3 episodes, this is very exciting\/dynamic\/entertaining show and I can't wait for another episode to be released.

I have been watching Star Trek since I was 7 or 8 years old and found it fascinating. Personally i didn't like Deep space 9 all that much because I thought it was to politically centered. The rest of the series were good. I was however, not happy with most of the 1st season of Star Trek The Next Generation I thought the Acting sucked really bad. I'm talking about: Can you...tell- I am - reading- from ,,, a cue card? Quite a few character where so \"wooden\" they could have used cardboard cut outs and no one would have noticed the difference. However, as Actors got comfortable and settled with their rolls things smoothed out. Anyway the point is, different people, different points of view, different pick apart points. Who cares. Personally I thought Patrick Stewart was a little off his game, but then again he was 14 years retired from Star Fleet But , i could tell that he was really tired in some of the scenes and it showed. All in All I gave it 9 Stars because all of it was executed really well. I was engaged and could not wait until Thursday to see the next episode. I can't wait until season 2 if there is one. I absolutely loved it. More please.","rating":"9\/10","date":"27 March 2020"}

{"title":"Exposition on steroids, and other soap opera stories that make no sense","review":"\"Say Zhat Vash again, I dare you to say Zhat Vash again, MF! Say Zhat Vash again, MF!\" I was imagining what SLJ would've said while hearing the same words repeated over and over again. It's obvious the creators of both Star Trek: Discovery and Picard know only a few characters, races and stories from the original Star Trek series like TOS and TNG, which makes for boring and forgettable TV shows.Star Trek for the new generation is full of terrible dialogue, filled with techno babble to try to make it sound smart (another symptom of Star Trek: Disease... sorry, Discovery), which fails to elicit any emotion other than boredom and frustration with what Star Trek has become. One is still hoping it might get better, but hope is such a dangerous thing.The swearing, the theatrics, the hubris. So many holographic displays, so many futuristic words, so many enemies with stupid names. It's as if there are only a few phonemes in the Romulan language, they all have -ag, -aj or -ahj endings, and most of those words sound like synonyms for the female sexual organ. It's full of \"sex\", action and technology on the surface, but inside it's full of the brown stuff.This show loves exposition as much as it loves a weak plot and annoying characters. Kurtzman is infamous for being unable to write a good story that isn't 80% nonsensical exposition, 10% quick-cut action and 10% running. It's worse than lazy, it's trying to come off as smart by using a lot of big, fancy words instead of sense and direction. It's just another melodramatic soap opera disguised as sci-fi action. It's just like Abrams' Star Wars, but way, way worse.","rating":"5\/10","date":"8 February 2020"}

{"title":"Remember when Star Trek represented the best of what humanity could aspire to?","review":"Ya, so that's gone.This Star Trek highlights the worst of what humanity is. Sure, Picard is fighting for the principles embodies by the 'good' Star Trek, but he is about the only good person left in the human race it would seem. Where Star Trek: Discovery has the black unit where all of the worst of humanity is cordoned off and isolated from the rest of the Federation, in this show it IS the Federation. They seem to be wanting to make the Federation look as awful as possible, to create the biggest obstacle possible for Picard, but it ruins the entire spirit of Star Trek in the process.Also, juvenile writing, acting and editing. some parts are fine, but some of the writing is so sophomoric it seems like it is written by film students... in high school.Jean Luc is always great, but they made the Federation the enemy and ruined the very thing about Star Trek that made it great. It's ability to inspire humanity to aspire to a form of greatness where we have transcended our baser instincts. This is a Federation that might as well be run by Trump, Nixon, and Kissinger.Edit: OK, so remember when I said up above that this show seemed like it was written by high school students? I am watching episode 3 and a character sitting with jean Luc, who she calls 'JL', takes a hit off of a Vape Pen and says the words \"Pro-tip:\" to Picard right before giving him life-advice.I am taking off 2 more stars for this atrocity.","rating":"4\/10","date":"1 February 2020"}
{"title":"Ignore The Bad Reviews","review":"Not sure what people were expecting, but all the bad reviews seem a little suspect. I like this show way better than The Next Generation, and almost as much as the Enterprise series. Patrick Stewart is in fine form. The storyline is good, and the acting is solid as well.Maybe people need to to go back to just enjoying movies and tv shows instead of picking everything apart. It's fiction, an escape. Sadly, I believe the expectations of some viewers makes it impossible for them to enjoy anything. And that's unfortunate. Oh well, the haters will moan, and I will sit back with all the other fans of the show and enjoy it.","rating":"8\/10","date":"11 March 2020"}
{"title":"Insanity is the only sane reaction to an insane society - Thomas Stephen Szasz","review":"Picard to date seems to be an exploration of this quote. The Federation has lost its way. It seems to have given in to fear, internaliaed and left the galaxy to fend for itself. Picard and new crew stand as a mix of all the federation used to represent with some darker and more grittily realistic characteristics. Picard himself is now the torchbearer of hope in this darker universe - the insane man being sane in an insane universe...\nIt is slow in its pace - but it doesnt overly rely on nostalgia to carry it (so far). It is building but ultimately to what.\nIts not old trek - its not epsiodicly trotting through a chocolate box of moral episodes, family episodes and humourous epsidodes. There are, so far no strange new worlds or civilisations but at its heart there is the hope for a better future that the star trek universe always offered - its simply now embedded in a few people. Theres a ring of Blakes Seven to it - lets hope it ends better for Picard et al...\nIf you want humour, family and deep explorations of humanity then rewatch TNG. This is not TNG and its not trying to be. But it is Star trek at its deepest and slowest...","rating":"8\/10","date":"28 February 2020"}

{"title":"Forget the Haters!","review":"Don't listen to the haters, this series is magnificent! Just seeing Patrick Stewart refill his role as Captain Picard should be reason enough to watch this series and revel in awe at the simple fact that it's happened. It's like watching Connery return as Bond in an alternate universe. And even if this show was an absolute pile of s**t it would still be worth watching for that fact. Luckily that is not the case.Although it's still very early in the series, Picard is already showing all the hallmarks of an instant classic. It does rush certain aspects that I would have preferred more fleshed out, but understandably it has to get to the point pretty quick and unfortunately forgo some character development with the new players (which the haters would have hated even more since they unjustly call this show \"boring\" to begin with). And that leads me to my next point....Picard is not boring. Both character and show intended. Subtle, subdued, introspective, yes all of the above. But todays audience just seems to want thrills and spectacle and nothing else. Even the original Next Generation wasn't like that, it was quietly bold and supremely existential in it's best episodes. And that's what I hope for going forward with Picard.Patrick Stewart as Picard is like an old friend you haven't seen in ages... Awkward for just a second then it's as if you never spent any time apart. Give this show a chance, it has the ability to be great.Plus it's awesome to see Brent Spiner as Data again, that android freakin' rocks!","rating":"9\/10","date":"26 February 2020"}
{"title":"Going downhill since Episode 1","review":"It's now at episode 6, over half-way so time for review.....\nOh dear, hardly anything has happened, Picard spends his time achieving very little other than being shouted at and put down by other people, for some reason an Elf from Lord of the Rings has been invited to stand around in the background doing nothing.Everything that's happened up to episode 6 could easily have been done in two episodes. The whole show has been padded-out with false drama around shallow pointless characters in this show which feels and looks like a mish mash of generic fantasy \/ sci-fi that has nothing to do with Star Trek. Everything is dark grey and half the sets look like an empty black sound stage with a couple of 1980s lazers pointing around and dry ice machines (Oooh it looks edgy and Dystopian like Blade Runner).Another aspect I dislike is that this show (also exec. produced by JJ Abrams) uses the tactic of positing vague irrational mysteries left-right and centre like Lost did, with very few sensible resolutions or pay-offs (until *maybe* the final episode which will no doubt be left mostly un-resolved, as is usually the case) and this is done in an attempt to keep people watching, as a substitute for good writing, good characters, good dialogue....which is the other (now considered 'old fashioned'?) method of keeping people watching.It's bad. Unfortunately my fears have been confirmed that this is produced by the same people who did Discovery and it's nearly as unlikable as I found that show to be. Can't really see that it's going to get any better now. shame. Old Star Trek shows could still have a bad episode now and again, but they were just singular bad episodes. In old Star Trek this would have been confined to a single episode but it's going to stretch out to 10.","rating":"1\/10","date":"1 March 2020"}
{"title":"Impressive addition to the Trek universe!","review":"I just finished watching Picard season 1. They did a great job of filling in the gaps of what characters have been doing since the show ended, and where they were going. Very impressed.It was basically the opposite of what Star Wars did with their last three movies.","rating":"10\/10","date":"23 April 2020"}
{"title":"Patrick Stewart should be ashamed! Atrocious mess!","review":"I don't really know where to begin - it's hard.Star Trek is supposed to be a utopian society where humanity has learned its lessons from the past. Earth is a relatively boring place where there is peace and tranquillity. There is no disease, poverty, or greed. Society is intelligent and works to better itself and the lives of all others. The Federation is an organization of numerous planets that have all proven themselves to be evolved, non-discriminatory or violent. The mission of Starfleet is to facilitate first contact, encounter the unknown, create peace, cultural exchange and acquire or share technology with other alien races.The struggle within Star Trek has always been one of morality, ethics and principles. Issues arise from outside situations, as many alien races hold different beliefs about what's right and wrong. Humanities gift is that of peace, reason, mutual understanding and friendship, one which is in conflict with other races whose primary focus might be the accumulation of wealth, power, war, secrecy or strong religious beliefs.Star Trek explores the possibilities of \"what if\" and \"the unknown\". It puts humanity on the forefront as it challenges us with difficult questions about our existence and how we deal with adversity. It attempts to showcase the absolute best qualities that humanity has to offer, and ties in everything we've learnt through our evolution to make the right choices within certain strict guidelines laid out by The Federation and Starfleet.The ships in Star Trek are extremely iconic, they all have detailed layouts and are very well thought off. Star Trek ships have never been copy paste reproductions and stand today as being some of the most intriguing and creative designs in science fiction history.Alien races are also exceedingly well detailed and intriguing. Some have even got their own languages, but there are experts on Trek lore that could go on about this for hours.Humanity is also on constant trial by a very powerful race called The Q Continuum. These omnipotent beings look across the universe in search of measurable growth and a higher form of thinking and development. If the growth of a civilisation stops and a society reverts to its petty former ways, then they are denied protection which ultimately leads to their annihilation and an end to their existence. A character named Q would often help Picard overcome a lot of dilemmas and ultimately lends a hand to save all of humanity with his power because he believes in their potential. He however warns Picard that \"the trial for humanity never stops\" and if they were to deviate then they would cease to exist.Now... absolutely none of that is seen in Star Trek Picard the TV series. It doesn't exist. It's like all of what Star Trek actually is has been erased. What you're seeing with this TV show is some very watered-down science fiction version of the old Star Trek series, with inaccurate reduplications of former characters and events. This show is also set in the future, but instead of resembling a society which has grown into something utopian and great, it strongly resembles a politically left-wing minded version of the world we see in today's modern times. Poverty exists on earth, the acquisition of wealth is a thing, Starfleet has an admiral who swears every other word she speaks, people have and condone slavery with the synthetic lifeforms, there seem to be no real governing principles or ideas which hold The Federation together anymore...The show also features a lot of the TNG cast, however they depict them in really inaccurate ways, and misinterpret their relationships possibly due to not really watching or knowing what the previous television shows were all about. It is like a Chinese whispers chain of events which constantly breaks down and changes to portray something more bizarre, nonsensical and embarrassing. We see a love story between a robot and a Romulan guy which is void of any real passion or substance. Seven of nine is now some bad ass cowboy chick that goes on wild lesbian encounters. Picard is old \"rich\" man in a vineyard surrounded by Romulan guards (which is very contradictory to the old series). Romulus (a planet formally tasked with secrecy and subversion) has been pointlessly destroyed in this universe. I could go on, but there are some insane discrepancies here for fans who love Star Trek which makes this show really difficult to watch.I watched the first 8 episodes? And then I stopped watching, I couldn't take it anymore, the plot lines were weak, the characters and their relationships were bizarre, this show condones murder and accepts a crew member who outright kills her lover. The characters are all very largely uncharacteristic of who they used to be in the television shows and movies. There is also nothing uplifting or no moral wrestling in any of these episodes, it's just action, nonsense and a really terrible uninteresting sequence of events.It's just not Star Trek, and is certainly not the Trek that I remember. A lot has changed, JJ Abrams made those horrific Star Trek movies, we had Enterprise which was a terrible and now this. It's sad to say, but just like the Star War Universe which came to a horrible demise with the last movie, so Star Trek has now met its final end with Picard.Is this what Patrick Stewart meant by giving people \"hope\" when they got back home after a long day's work?I would highly discourage anyone watching this series. I wish I knew that Picard would be another Discovery like rehash. If I was aware of this then I would've skipped it and honestly saved my emotions and time. To the new faces out there who are enjoying Picard, well I empathise. When I first saw Star Wars Episode 1 (as a child) I thought that it was the greatest Star Wars movie ever - that was, until I watched all the other Star Wars movies that were made prior.","rating":"1\/10","date":"13 April 2020"}
{"title":"Maybe it's not YOUR Star Trek","review":"FFS people, Star Trek fans are the whiniest (not sure it's a word) fans around. \"It's not Gene Roddenberry's original vision\", with a \"lack of optimism\" with most of the reviews posted after watching episode 5ish, do you know how ironic that is?! Since TOS the next series is criticised for not being like the last, why would you want it to be?! You can watch the old one, there is no growth in that, Star Trek would die otherwise. Your favourite series is normally what you saw as a child, when you were young, dumb and full of for mentioned optimism. Yes kids can't watch it because of the swearing, violence, drug references etc. But they're not supposed, it's rated a 15 for that reason.Wow, thanks for letting me vent, now about the show.It's a well crafted love letter to Commander Data. Who started watching this and forgot Data was dead? Me, because we all remember the end of Nemesis right?! I remember Tom Hardy is in it & he's a clone of Picard, that's about it. So this new series rectifies that full stop on the TNG series and somewhat mediocre films. Giving Data the true send off he deserves.Along the way we encounter old friends like Seven of Nine, Riker, Troy and poor old Hugh. There is some great acting by the cast especially Alison Pill, Santiago Cabrera and the standout Lulu Wilson as Riker & Troy's daughter, great things could be in her future.The story is something different, a narrative driven mini series revolving around synthetic life, has been touched upon on previous Star Trek episodes, especially in TNG, but not like this. They bring in all aspects, androids, the cyborg borg and synthetic humans weaving in the new and old characters. Like who thought Seven & Picard had something in common, never thought of it until now. It's well conceived and written from a place of love for TNG. The plot is a little thin in parts but it's enough to keep you interested and wondering what's next.Yes it's not the Picard I grew up with, but times change and so must we. It's not perfection, but what is?! I gave it a 10 out of love not rational thought. If you love TNG and didn't shed a tear at the end, what kind of monster are you?! I think this could be a stepping stone to something even greater in season 2.Sorry for this long diatribe but I feel better now, thanks for reading and thanks for exsisting.","rating":"10\/10","date":"2 May 2020"}
{"title":"Excellent","review":"Most people apparently expected this show to simply rehash The Next Generation. I can speak for everyone with any sense that it's wonderful that it isn't that. This is a more mature show which keeps some of the important themes of TNG. It has a clear plot, though those with short attention spans may struggle to follow it.Honestly, I'm certain all of the negative reviews are simply because it's not TNG. I doubt those people would have been happy in any scenario, unless they brought back the full cast and remade every episode, scene for scene. The imdb rating is pretty appropriate as of the time of this review(8.4)I'm sad to see Patrick Stewart looking so old, the man is a treasure, but I'm really glad to see him return for another go in the Trek universe.","rating":"9\/10","date":"20 February 2020"}
{"title":"Great study of humanity","review":"This is not the star trek where Jordi technobabbles or the Enterprise is doomed but five minutes before the hour Kirk pulls off another miracle. This show takes the time to tell one story per season, with an overwhelming theme of \"humanity\" and \"family\" that are the subject of the fiction.And Season 2, with the theme of relationships (running from them, needing them, the pain of losing someone, etc) has a ton of heart.Slight downgrade for the depiction of ICE agents... Seriously, a police\/ICE raid without covering the back door? I'll believe the transporters and Borg Queens, but not modern cops failing to follow the most basic operating practice.Good show, though.","rating":"9\/10","date":"26 February 2023"}
{"title":"This is the way!","review":"With this third season they finally got it! This is Star Trek. Recovering the Enterprise D and it's crew was awesome and it says a lot of what Trekkies were waiting for all this years: new seasons of STN, most likely the best Star Trek show ever, at least in the long lasting impact it had in all us they followed the show 30 years ago.After all this years, Star Trek is still a sign of both a hope in a better future and a picture of the best that human kind is capable of.The new USS Enterprise G with Captain Seven is a lot of hope! I am looking forward to the new show!Definitely, this is the way!","rating":"9\/10","date":"22 April 2023"}
{"title":"Extremely Disappointing","review":"I went to the trouble of watching the first three episodes before attempting to review the title. This is not the Star Trek that we all know and love, and it certainly is not the Star Trek that Gene Roddenberry created. Gone is the utopian vision, gone is the optimism, gone is the exploration. This is dark and dystopian, but that's not my real problem. What bothers me is that it's extremely stupid. There's an incredible amount of gratuitous violence, including little girls who can defeat ten men single-handedly, and people being dissolved by acid, and gigantic explosions. The preamble to Star Trek states that it's the Enterprise's mission \"to boldly go where no man has gone before\". Now, not only is the Enterprise gone, but we're also going to old tired places where we've already been before. Romulans. Sentient androids. The Borg. Blah.The reason I love Star Trek is that it gave me hope for the future. It was inspirational. It made me feel that human beings are capable of being good. My whole life, it's been hard for me to maintain any kind of faith in humanity. CBS has made it that much harder for me to keep that faith.","rating":"1\/10","date":"8 February 2020"}
{"title":"Warning: This is Not Roddenberry's Star Trek","review":"Clearly, Star Trek Discovery showed us a Star Trek series unlike the standard Star Trek Series. Discovery tells a story of the development of idealistic future order in a war chaotic universe. Then came Picard, Star Trek Picard is a statement that perfect world requires maintenance and pure vision. Picard is an idealist retiring in an ideal world heading towards chaos. What did Picard do? As usual, he takes matters into his own hands and signed on for a new adventure.If TNG is peaceful, bright and colorful; Discovery is metalic, dark and cold; Picard is earthy, in the shade of grey but still thick with humanity. It's edgier and stamping their mark on your screen with \"same-dude-new-world\" situation. A bit out of place, despite his status as respected, a leader, and strong headed old man in the world he helped to shape.FYI: Seven of Nine cameo is refreshing and bold.","rating":"9\/10","date":"21 February 2020"}
{"title":"An absolute travisty, Patrick Stewart what have you done?","review":"Awful, absolute trash, the New Generation was a superb series, great characters, great stories, a star ship you wanted to be on, great captain, planets you wish you could visit one day, a whole family of all ages could watch and enjoy and then BOOM fast forward in to the future and you get this utter utter garbage.A total bore feast of a story line, long winded, it could have been done and dusted in three episodes. Flat wooden characters you don't connect to, absolutely awful annoying characters and I include the once great Picard in that.To make matters worse the foul language, really? Do we now need to have swearing in Star Trek, I know it is now everywhere, but it made me cringe when I heard it, so we've got one with a cigar in his mouth and strong bad language, this is not the star trek I grew up with.All the good the New Generation done has been completely undone in this pathetic show, woeful truly woeful, talk about going out with a bang.","rating":"1\/10","date":"4 April 2020"}
{"title":"Grown up Trek","review":"Not sure why there is negativity against this. I am gripped week to week on this. It's a fun story and fascinated to see how it works out. Sure it is a very different place and style to 80s\/90s Berman era Trek...but so what?! Going back to TNG I find painful and dull to watch - that is serialised \"alien of the week\" which worked at the time but today...no thank you.The cast is excellent in Picard and Patrick Stewart is as excellent as ever. It's a damn sight more adult in its tone and special effects - back in TNG we just assumed the gore happened, just didn't see it. With the event of other TV series we don't have to imagine any more. Awesome.The hidden nods to previous trek series are great and to see Trek on a stage as well funded as this is just wonderful.

I'm grateful to see most of the horrid ones taken down, but do their ratings get taken down?Star Trek is IDIC which means infinite diversity in infinite combinations, been that way since the 60's. Two women in a scene doin science is not going to hurt you. And it could save a life representation matters, and why does it seem like you want all these fab people gone and just want your tele to go back to just showing straight white men only.

{"title":"This started great, and now just gets better and better...","review":"Okay I don't know why so many people hate this show? Maybe they object to having a central protagonist who is 80+ years old? IdkI loved it. I watched the first season in it's entirety, and I loved that. Although my wife and kid turned off after the first couple of shows. But I persevered... And did they deliver for the second season? In spades?We've got star performances by Data (the human android), with his daughter, who is also cute.Some new cast members, Whoopie Goldberg also makes an appearance. Basically there is enough of the old Science Fiction in here, to keep the older viewers happy, and enough new action and quality dialogue, to appeal to the new viewers. If you want another Game of Thrones, 50 Shades of Grey, or whatever the latest 'thing is', I'm sorry but you may be disappointed.But if you are ready to try something new, ready to watch how Patrick Stewart deals with a much younger, generation of actors and actresses, and see how plot novelties from time travel, across alternative universes, was managed, be prepared to be amazed!I certainly was.","rating":"10\/10","date":"28 April 2022"}

{"title":"Where to begin.... Or end","review":"So after watching Star Trek: The Generation and associated spin-offs for most of my life, the end of season 3 just gathered all that nostalgia together and tied it into a nice little bow. Season 1 was decent however season 2 just lost its way after trying to remake a season version of Star Trek IV. But whoever the writers of season 3 are really did their homework and made up for any missteps. All the main previous characters where brought back perfectly, somehow without it being forced. And it begged the question, why not be this good from the first place? Good writers do help, but it was ultimately the nostalgia that did it. Brilliantly done and fingers crossed their will be some extension of this, especially as Picard Jr was such a good addition.","rating":"9\/10","date":"19 May 2023"}
{"title":"Where a lot of series have gone before","review":"Like many others I did so want to enjoy Picard- the second coming, but there were so many obstacles in the way.Why did we go so far into the darkness. Why was every returning character and new one beset by such misfortune, sure the odds are that one of the former crew had a happy life. It's like the makers went out and out to depress all the loyal followers out of sheer malice.\n7 of 9 a disillusioned vengeful bounty hunter\nJL on the brink of death and feeling the icy hand of death on his shoulder\nRafi a recovering alcoholic, causing the break up of her family\nWill and Deanna hiding the grief of losing their son.I mean I like a bit of realism as much as the next guy but from being held as the hero of starfleet, defeating the Borg and a Romulan uprising to being a geriatric pariah of the galaxy... I mean come on. Give me something to work with.Looking forward to Guinan making an appearance in season 2, that is unless she is dying from some terminal disease or goes rogue. I really miss the episodic nature of TNG where everything is wrapped up at the end of each episode and it doesn't take 8 long winded parts to come to an unsatisfactory conclusion. Happy endings, wasn't that what Star Trek was all about, but who needs optimism these days.","rating":"3\/10","date":"15 June 2020"}
{"title":"Season 3 is a Wonderful Surprise!","review":"Season 3 of Picard is wonderful. The plot is complicated and holds several surprises, but unfolds in true STNG style, keeping you interested and anxious for the next episode. The guest stars are familiar faces you will be glad to see, along with a few new faces that are exceptionally good in their roles. Amanda Plummer is a convincing sinister antagonist that makes you hate her pretty quickly. She is from a race that we haven't encountered before, and she is a suitable complement to another villain that we have. The final Episode is a perfect, completely satisfying, appropriate, and heartwarming finale to say goodbye to the Star Trek Next Generation series and cast. You will not be disappointed.","rating":"10\/10","date":"28 April 2023"}

Nice to see a return of Worf, Riker, Deanna, Data, Seven of Nine etc..... but baddass Raffi. (--- im out of breath with excitment). The changeling storyline, Data's restoration, the borg & starflight being in diss-aray all very exciting.

{"title":"Just a point about Erasure","review":"I just want to say this about the show. I honestly can say I hate Picard as a character now. And one reason is that the writers have literally desecrated and erased the entire French culture from the STU. Just pause to imagine, in the future an African Federation captain grew up in Nigeria. In his flashback scenes he acted like a kid from China. Him and his parents spoke Chinese and did Chinese things. Apparently, the country in Africa had canonically no African heritage in the future. Think about that outrage that would cause.As a character we grew up with Picard, learned about his various traits and mannerisms, now they were a bit odd, or not very Frenchy per se but even though he had a British accent we can all agree French accents are very...theatrical and humorous to listen too. Pepe Le Pew and all that. So we can let it slide.However in this show they cannot let you forget how they excised ALL of France from Picard's life until you can utterly forget where he comes from. He may as well have grown up in a British boarding school. His mom and dad have British accents, he looks like the lead singer of Coldplay as a kid. Picard does not eat French food, have French interests and they make no attempt to even celebrate his background. Even though he lives in the 25th century, Picard as a kid has no computer games, or sports. What would have been fun is if he was wearing French Football team national clothes. And his favorite sport was soccer. His dad had a thick French accent and his mom was British. Given that he hated his dad and was a big time mommas boy, he chose British accent. That is a fun plot right?But they tried in no way to portray that and therefore they are saying Britain took over France in the future and the entire French culture disappeared. I know there are a lot of reasons to dislike this show but I just wanted to mention something after the latest episode that highly bothered me about Picards story.","rating":"10\/10","date":"30 April 2022"}

This latest installment is a shining example of what Star Trek: Picard should have been from the start, and it does not disappoint.From the very first episode, it is evident that the creative team behind Star Trek: Picard has listened to the feedback of fans and course-corrected with a renewed vision for the series. The writing is sharp, engaging, and thought-provoking, tackling complex themes of morality, humanity, and the evolving nature of the Star Trek universe with the depth and nuance that fans have come to expect.Patrick Stewart reprises his iconic role as Captain Jean-Luc Picard with unparalleled grace and gravitas, delivering a performance that is both nostalgic and fresh. The return of familiar faces from previous Star Trek series, as well as the introduction of new characters, adds depth and complexity to the story, creating a rich tapestry of relationships and interactions that draw viewers in and keep them hooked.The visual effects are breathtaking, with stunning space battles, awe-inspiring alien worlds, and meticulously designed starships that transport viewers to the far reaches of the galaxy. The attention to detail in the costumes, sets, and props is a true testament to the love and dedication that the production team has for the Star Trek franchise.In addition to the thought-provoking storytelling, Season 3 of Star Trek: Picard also delivers on the action and adventure that fans crave. The well-choreographed fight scenes, thrilling space battles, and daring missions keep viewers on the edge of their seats and provide a perfect balance of drama and excitement.","rating":"9\/10","date":"25 April 2023"}

{"title":"The Old Guard","review":"I grew up on TNG. And TOS which was just a bit earlier. And I was there to see the quality of storytelling grow from bad to worse in later years, so much so that I never even watched the second season of that train wreck called Discovery, and none of the recent movies.But this series? This series changes it all. Slow at first, it reads almost as a tribute to the Old Man, but it becomes much more than that. And in the third season, it culminates into the spirit of the good old Star Trek we know and love. The urge to go forth, to discover, to improve, to connect, to reconnect. To boldy go. To sleep, in Worf's case, but hey, that also comes with age.This series is the best thing I've watched in quite a while, and I watched quite a lot during the pandemic. I am proud to call myself a trekkie again, and I am eager to witness the exploits and tribulations of your Jack Crusher, who is portrait quite amazingly by a wonderful Ed Speeler. Keep it up in the TRUE spirit of Star Trek please. Just like with ST:P.","rating":"10\/10","date":"6 August 2023"}
{"title":"Review for Season 3, let's keep these seasons coming!","review":"This review applied primarily to season 3. I enjoyed the other seasons, although they had their own different vibe, feel and story arc. Enough so that they deserve their own, separate reviews. Season 3! If you were a fan of Next Generation then I suspect you will enjoy it. Season 3 had many of the Next Generation tropes and very much felt like an updated version of something you would have seen back on the show. The special effects and sets were awesome, much, much better than what was available in the late 80s\/early 90s! I enjoyed the show and hope it continues. That being said, Patrick Stewart, while I love him, he is getting a bit old...","rating":"9\/10","date":"25 April 2023"}
{"title":"Lazy writers, inconsistent plot, major continuity issues!","review":"I watched season one of Picard and generally speaking, it was ok. It wasn't the best, and there were some annoying issues, but at least it had some kind of meaningful closure.Season two was a train wreck. There are elements to character backstories that were unnecessary, made no sense, and\/or conflicted with prior character backstories. There are parts where the writers tried to make it seem like this character or that character were discriminated against, even though several other characters had similar backstories but were never discriminated against. It's like the writers wanted to virtue signal, but had no idea how to pull it off--and they failed miserably regardless.After the season finale, it felt like Picard's character was diminished and undignified. The second season didn't break down Picard's character to explain something meaningful. The second season destroyed any respect for the Picard character and tried to rebuild Picard as someone different. The character development was topical and disingenuous.Everything else was like someone let Google AI write the dialogue and story-line using a 5 year old's fan-created Wiki page.I'm done with new Trek!","rating":"3\/10","date":"8 May 2022"}
{"title":"Season 3 is REALLY good - don't bother with 1 and 2","review":"Honestly - just skip seasons 1 and 2 and go straight to 3 which is what I would call \"real\" trek - in fact probably the first real Trek we've seen since Enterprise.I have no clue how they possibly screwed up, season 1 and 2 so badly but came back so strong with season 3.Season 3 has everything you want - genuine characters, strong actors, a few genuinely funny moments thrown in here and there, decent morals but with none of the totally over the top, surface deep corny Disney style politically correct waffle that Discovery has.The pacing seems a lot better than all other modern Star Trek as well.TLDR - watch season 3!","rating":"8\/10","date":"30 May 2023"}
{"title":"Boldly going... Somewhere?","review":"Where do I even start with this show? How do I even begin to organize my wildly varying thoughts and feelings about it? When I think of its best moments, rating it a 5 seems overly harsh. When I think of its worst, that 5 seems overly generous. So more than anything I'm saying the show is deeply and crazily uneven. Your mileage will vary.If you're looking to recapture that feeling you got watching syndicated TNG reruns as a 12-year old after completing your homework, you're not going to find that here... Oh, except for those rare moments where there's a high likelihood you will.If you're disenchanted with the more action oriented direction the Star Trek franchise has taken, you're likely to remain disappointed... Except when you're not.More than anything, Picard's first season feels like a disparate grab bag of ideas and references (virtually every prior iteration of Star Trek is referenced in some capacity here, even the 2009 reboot) awkwardly and not entirely convincingly stitched together. With that in mind, individual moments occasionally shine through, the cast is uniformly fine, and Jeff Russo's score is terrific. The story reaches for--and occasionally achieves--emotional resonance, but it's undermined by a lack of internal logic. Some plot threads go nowhere. Others appear out of nowhere, seemingly at random, serving no larger narrative purpose.Overall I'm forced to admit that I think the show represents a swing and a miss. But I do appreciate the fact it at least took the swing.","rating":"5\/10","date":"9 June 2020"}

{"title":"A worthy addition to an epic saga","review":"What a joy to have been able to witness. A truly worthy addition to TNG's legacy. The return of so many childhood heroes in a dignified manner. Those who'd advocate abolishment of Picard, lost the dreamer inside - the kid that watched TNG in awe. This series filled me with the same joy as it used to when I watched the original as a kid. Jean-Luc Picard served as a beacon of dignified curiosity then and he still does now. It moved with the times and instead of clinging to an outdated, albeit beloved, legacy it renewed without losing any of Roddenberry's inspirational spark. Star Trek has evolved as we all have, this being a very positive and worthy addition to a universe and cast I've come to love over decades. A tap of the hat to the director and writers and a heartfelt bow to the original actors whom have taking up the mantle with such dignity.","rating":"10\/10","date":"31 March 2020"}

I'm sure there are better ways to portray Rafi then making her a druggie i understand you want some sort of redemption story for her but there must be a better way so that she can redeem herself other than this drug use paraphernalia shaming her motherhood stuff.

{"title":"Don't upset Star Trek fans...","review":"Well, do not upset the old Star Trek fans. The low scores are what you'll get. Look, if you want the old quirky alien of the week story with a happy moral tale, this is not for you. And judging my some of the reviews, it's clear this is not for those Trekkies. But if you understand human nature and how fear will always penetrate and direct our bias, you will understand that the Star Trek utopia would have always failed. Brexit is an example of that.\nThis show follows Picard as he chases one last adventure. He is old and Time is no longer his friend. He yearns for space. With a motley crew he takes control of a ship to save a new species. There is betrayal. There are politics. There is the reality of negativity.\nThis is a good series that should be taken for what it is, and not for what old Trekkies want it to be.\nRios is a great character (as are the others) and deserves his own show in the Star Trek universe. Seven of Nine equally deserves her own crew.\nI await the next adventures eagerly. It is a good show.","rating":"8\/10","date":"3 May 2020"}
{"title":"Picard: Season 2 is an Abomination","review":"I love classic Start Trek (TOS \/ TNG). I love Patrick Stewart. But even an actor as great as Patrick Stewart cannot redeem writing and plotting that is this AWFUL.Season 1 of Picard was mediocre (meh).Season 2 of Picard is a complete abomination. It betrays the character of Captain Picard. It betrays the entire classic Trek canon. The plot and dialogue are laugh-out loud stupid (don't get me started on the Borg suddenly becoming the Federation's \"greatest ally\").Don't waste your time on this garbage.","rating":"1\/10","date":"17 May 2022"}
{"title":"Closure for TNG","review":"I enjoyed the first season of Picard immensely, and the many negative reviews have encouraged me to write my first review.Start Trek: Picard is the most sombre and fragile iteration of the series that I've seen, and possibly also the most gritty. The sentimentality that Jean-Luc (\"JL\") expresses towards his old friends and crew, the fallibility of his character and the harsh universe that Picard depicts are all, to varying degrees, at odds with the universe built by previous series in the franchise.But to those who see this as a corruption of the franchise, I would just say that challenging the status quo has always been what Star Trek was about. Jean Luc Picard was never perfect, and the Federation was never an infallible institution.Picard explores the later stages of life for the crew of the Enterprise and of other \"ships\" that I won't discuss to avoid spoilers. It expands on Jean Luc Picard's character, arguably the most well constructed character in all of Star Trek, and adds a whole new level of complexity and understanding to some old races that we previously hadn't seen in such depth.The sound track is fitting, and it's worth listening to John Russo's soundtrack for the series on its own.Finally, I completely understand that if you come at hoping to see a depiction of the utopian culture that is the Federation in the earlier series then you'll no doubt be disappointed. But Star Trek can be so much more than that, and I for one really enjoy the corruptible and visceral Federation that we are beginning to see in the newer iterations.","rating":"8\/10","date":"15 April 2020"}
{"title":"Excellent Star Trek Continuance","review":"I have no idea why some people rate this so lowly. I lost an entire nights sleep over the first 6 episodes because I was so gripped by the cliffhangers. As a dyed in the wool Trekkie I found this to be a perfect continuation of TNG. The spirit of openness and acceptance that we came to love is alive and well here. Each episode gave an entertaining mix of jeopardy and balance. Picard is still unwaveringly Picard. The rest of the cast each give amazing performances and support the spirit of TNG as well as I could have hoped. I can only imagine that the regrettable current wave of right wing populism that would object to the inclusiveness I so much enjoyed would have been responsible for some of the down voting. Anyone who understood and appreciated what original Star Trek, TNG, Voyager etc was really about will love this. Ten out of ten for me.","rating":"10\/10","date":"29 July 2022"}
{"title":"It's Not TNG; But That's Necessarily Not a Bad Thing.","review":"If you've ever read a book and loved the characters so much that you wanted to know what happened to them after the last page, you will like this show. Assuming you liked TNG, of course. However, Star Trek: Picard is a great show even if you've never watched Star Trek in any version.Sir Patrick Stewart is an incredibly talented actor (Logan, for example) and he doesn't hold back in this show. And, although this show isn't \"TNG cont.,\" it definitely IS Captain Jean-Luc Picard.I've never given a review 10 out of 10 before, but this show earned it! The pre-existing characters like Picard, Riker and Data are true to their TNG roots, and the new characters are compelling and well-written. The pacing, the plot and the writing are all great, too. The story overall is very entertaining but there are also moments that are particularly thrilling if you're a TNG fan, like the inclusion of the Borg character Hugh, from the TNG episode \"I, Borg.\" There are several moments like that but they're never frivolous or wasted.I was never a huge TNG fan but I binge-watched Picard. It's well worth watching!","rating":"10\/10","date":"28 January 2022"}
{"title":"Terrible!","review":"Terrible, the show is one of the worst out of all of the Star Trek shows. If you watched and liked the other ones you will despise this one. The script and the plot was terrible and they didn't have a b story. They also continued to ruin the Star Trek universe. The only thing that .are the show bearable enough to watch was a camio from two or three of Captain Picard's friends.","rating":"8\/10","date":"15 December 2020"}

Unfortunately they're idiots!","rating":"4\/10","date":"8 April 2020"}
{"title":"Excellent musing on life, liberty, happiness.","review":"Lots of people evidently disliked the show, but it's one of my favorite Star Trek spinoffs yet. Great story and action, enjoyable characters (though not always as central as their attention might imply), timely political commentary, fascinating philosophical musings of wrestling with a life worth living, a life of meaning. Those snippets of Camus, Nietzsche, Kierkegaard weren't just tips of the hat to philosophy but pointed to the kinds of reflection that permeated the season. It entertained me, made me think, and brought tears to my eyes. Everything I want a show to do. Bravo.","rating":"9\/10","date":"10 May 2020"}
{"title":"Nope.","review":"I am the proud possessor of a pre-teen crush on the original Spock in my personal history. I, too, believe Gene Roddenberry would be rolling over in his grave, if he had one, had he seen this pallid (literally) effort. (He was cremated and some of his ashes were twice sent into space.) My love of all things Trek waned with the 2009 reboot when I saw Spock involved with Uhura.However, I adore Sir Patrick and had atmospheric hopes for this new show. Alas, his noble effort cannot make up for the oddities in Episode 1. These include a hackneyed dream awaking, odd use of nice Romulans as house servants, awkward introduction of the female protagonist, and obvious foreshadowing in Data's appearance. And poorly written dialogue could not adequately explain why the Trek canon should be so disrespected.I will not be joining this decidedly lowercase \"trek.\"","rating":"1\/10","date":"3 February 2020"}

{"title":"Not All Star Trek Has To Be The Same","review":"So many reviews all say the same thing - it's not star trek. I've watched both the new and old star trek shows and what makes them star trek? Science, space and meeting alien life. Just because a show doesn't do what you want it to doesn't make it a bad show. And not gonna lie but, some of the so called classic star trek is boring.The show is great and makes you invested in the characters. There is action but not excessive which makes Picard instantly better than Discovery. The only main issue I have with the show is the F bombs dropped by certain characters, it just doesn't suit their personality.I know the show is being picked up for another season which to me seems very unnecessary given the way the first season ended. Personally I can't see where they would take a second season and I don't hold high hopes for it.","rating":"9\/10","date":"21 July 2020"}

{"title":"Oh yes ... yes and yes","review":"Finally a Star Trek show that actually humanizes their protagonists instead of hiding them behind a wall of rules as kind of emotions cloaking device. In season 2 the very fact that all this political correct federation stuff gets in the way when it comes to truthfully get to the core of ones inner self is what drives the show - personalized foremost, but not exclusively, in none other than the one and only Picard. That said, there is all the good classic stuff as well, superbly choreographed and CGIed syfy action, thrilling story, complicated and exotic villains worthy of the next generation's legendary captain.In a nutshell: It's the most ambivalent and complex and therefore most authentic and human show that ever came out of this franchise. I truly hope the orthodox community gets over her illusions and starts to treasure this gem, so it cherishs us for a long time.","rating":"9\/10","date":"29 April 2022"}
{"title":"Bored out of my mind","review":"I say when I watched Discovery I got really angry at the series, but watching Picard I am having trouble to stay awake, basically watching the series I am constantly looking in my phone to keep me distracted.Since Enterprise we have not have had any descent Trek except for the fan films which surpass anything Kurtzman and team produce.I will now say the pros of this series. The positive side is the CGI and that Patrick Stewart is back, very nice they did they brought back the Enterprise D in the first episode.Now to the Cons which consists of terrible writing, terrible acting, to much action for a TV series and it makes it look more like a film than a series, weak plot and they seem to stretch out the series, which probably they could have done the entire series in just three episodes.Bottom line this is not Star Trek, it is a cheap copy of Star Trek, Blade Runner, Terminator, Lord of the Rings and so many other series, and there is nothing original in this pile of crap. I will give it two stars since Discovery takes the prize of one star, and this is still being generous.","rating":"3\/10","date":"13 February 2020"}
{"title":"Excellent","review":"Please don't believe the bad reviews. I don't think they were watching the same show I was. I thoroughly enjoyed this show and I am looking forward to next season.

{"title":"Patrick Stewart is back, but Trek is not","review":"Patrick Stewart is excellent but overall the show suffers in many of he same ways as Discovery. Big action scenes, melodramatic tears and acting, edgy moody vibes, and disjointed writing and editing.. It lacks the philosophical inquiry and discussion that made Trek such a hit for decades. I wanted to love new trek but I find it immensely disappoiting.","rating":"4\/10","date":"9 February 2020"}
{"title":"Don't believe the haters","review":"This is amazing. We finally get a really really great Star Trek show and people are haters.(small disclaimer, I haven't seen more than 5-6 episodes of Discoverys first season so I don't know much about that series and all my comments below only reflects Star Trek: Picard compared to TOS, TAS, TNG, DS9, VOY and ENT).The only reason I can see as to why you would hate this series is cause the concept of it is a bit different than other Star Trek shows.\nStar Trek has always been about \"the good guys\". The bunch of people around the leader of a ship\/place doing what they do to further the good of the federation but this series is not.This is a story about Picard and his travels when he encounters strange things that happens to him. He recruits people around him, sure, but he doesn't have a crew around him as we're used to.... and it's awesome. It's absolutely brilliant.\nFollow the partly disgraced former Captain Picard on his adventures full of massive nostalgia, awesome story, wonderful characters and a brilliant backstory.","rating":"10\/10","date":"18 April 2020"}
{"title":"Let's Dial it Back a Little, Folks","review":"OK, I get it. ST Picard may not be all the things Star Trek lovers yearned for. It is lacking that Gene Roddenberry magic. Rather than portraying a bright, optimistic future, it's fairly dark and dystopian. There is actual profanity (gasp), a little substance abuse, and some very intense violence. It feels a lot more like a generic, run-of-the-mill sci-fi endeavor than Star Trek.But, good grief, get over it. This show is terrific. It even has a bit of the classic Star Trek campiness (of course we can't go undercover on a foreign world without a pimp hat, an eyepatch, and a French accent!) The visuals are great, the storyline is suspenseful, and Patrick Stewart is magnificent. We've had Data, 7 of 9, Hugh, and here comes Riker! I love it!Bottom line, I am a very fussy, very critical reviewer. But I am here to tell you all these one star reviews are ridiculous, and you are missing a lot if you don't give this show a try.","rating":"8\/10","date":"2 March 2020"}

{"title":"Different form of Star Trek but good","review":"I admit this series started strong on the first episode and then went flat line for a while but by adding the older characters I think made it more interesting to me. Personally I think the reviews of others seem to be negative because they are looking for a show that has a crew going on missions and this is not. More of an intelligence mission and mystery show that is connected throughout the episodes. Season 1 was great, Season 2 ok, season 3 I really like so far because the original cast is back, plus using Deep Space nine villains. The only thing is I thought the Dominion hated to kill each other and so far don't care? What happened.","rating":"8\/10","date":"12 March 2020"}
{"title":"A vast letdown, this is nowhere near what trek is.","review":"Where is the Starfleet that I love so much, apparently they are corrupt now. Where is the intelligence and integrity of Picard, instead we just get an old depressed man. The hopeful, intelligent and enlightened future that Roddenberry brought to the screen is now replaced with a dystopian mess of bad writing. There are no worthwhile characters. Tasha Yar was in very few of the next gen episodes but she had a greater character in just one episode than any of these new ones throughout this hopeless shambles of a series. I'm so disappointed with this series. Keep a watch out for anything that has the name kurtzman, when you see it, avoid it at all costs. He needs to leave now. I will stick with Star Trek the original series, The Next Generation, Deep Space Nine, Voyager and Enterprise. They are far better. Even the animated originals outclassed this.","rating":"1\/10","date":"21 February 2020"}

It just cheapens something that could naturally have strong females in it.Kathryn Janeway was a strong captain, thoughtful and smart and didn't have to degrade men to get her point over.\"Men = weak, misogynistic and awful racist's\"\n\"Wahmen = amazing POWERFUL slayers YASSSS, practically perfect in every way omg YASSSS\"No.Don't let the title fool you, this is Picard in name only...","rating":"1\/10","date":"2 February 2020"}

But it's a real slog to try to get through this season. The stars I do give it are mainly based on potential because tight now the show is really lacking any flow. Setting my personal opinions aside, if you are rating this show an 8 and above that means you feel it compares to some of the best shows sci-fi ever made. I don't feel there is anyway this show can objectively be compared to some of the best sci-fi shows of all time, especially not based on this first season.

Numerous continuity errors and a story that doesn't make any sense, in a \"This doesn't make any sense in terms of logic and reason\" way. There are multiple elements that are just plain dumb (Our Sun cannot factually go supernova, and in Star Trek, TV hasn't been used for centuries, just to name two without spoiling) and there are so many annoying inconsistencies. Just like the recent Star Trek movies and shows, it honestly feels like the writers never actually watched Star Trek. Also, there are FIVE writers just for the first episode, so that probably explains why everything is so mind numbingly inconsistent and incoherent. There are too many ideas placed into one episode and the result is a poorly written mess that is only saved by Patrick Stewart's performance.

STP is just not condensed into 1 hour episodic adventures. This is a complete story that had plenty of time to be told and was fleshed out with likable new characters and old favorites.

{"title":"Naysayers say nay","review":"This is not your grandpa's Star Trek.\nTimes have changed, and do did production values, storytelling, audiences and the world and n general.No Trek was perfect from day one, nor did any Trek installment received positive reviews at first.TNG was not TOS, DS9 was not TNG, and I hope I don't need to remind you the horrid reaction to Discovery.For what it's worth, Picard does a great job on following up on what's left of the TNG universe, allows closure and takes us on a new adventure with new and familiar faces.I'm holding my breath till season two.","rating":"8\/10","date":"16 April 2020"}
{"title":"Slow pacing and characterisation of Picard.","review":"In preparation for Picard we sat down and re-watched the entire Star Trek: Next Generation and loved it. We timed it perfectly to begin watching Picard and the first episode was okay. It kept us interested enough to come back for episode 2 but after that it has been a struggle to continue watching. The pacing is slow and the delivery of lines by Patrick Steward no longer holds up to the original characterisation which was so full of energy and strength. I've tried twice so far to continue watching episode 4. The second time my husband and 12 year old daughter joined me but since they both went to sleep 15 minutes into it, I decided to turn it off and watch something else.","rating":"2\/10","date":"22 February 2020"}
{"title":"My first Star Trek show","review":"I'd never watched a Star Trek series before this, just the couple of new reboot movies released this last decade. I'm afraid I have to say this series was quite underwhelming. I never seemed to latch on to the story and it looked like I had to have seen the original shows to wrap my head around all the backgrounds and characters. And though I may not be entitled to saying this, but there didn't seem to be much Star Trekking around.","rating":"9\/10","date":"17 September 2020"}

{"title":"Much better than Discovery","review":"Not being a big Next Generation fan, and having missed most of DS9 and Enterprise I did not know what to expect. I was pleasantly surprised with Picard up to episode 5, the most recent.I had watched Discovery and found it just stupid and wasteful of talent. But Picard has a bit of the old original series feel to it. The possibility of a tight knit crew with at least some humour. Unlike Discovery's cast of interstellar depressives.The writing seems to be OK so far. Ditto the scenery. Less of the studio constructed streets and more open air. Actin is decent as well. Just hope they can maintain momentum.","rating":"9\/10","date":"25 February 2020"}
{"title":"Great entertainment","review":"Quite a lot of low reviews on here. Why are people so down on this show? Are they all mad Trekkies starved for the USS Enterprise?? Well tough. It can't stay the same. Things move on, casts get older. It can't be like Next Generation. New stories need to be told, and this one is told very well.I grew up with Next Generation, so was curious about this series. It doesn't disappoint- new characters (as well as some beloved old ones) exciting set pieces, and Patrick Stewart giving a great performance as a world weary but adventurous Picard. Excellent support from Santiago Canberra, Alison Pill and a wonderfully drunk and bitter Michelle Hurd provide comic relief, poignancy, and humour.This series is a great piece of Friday night entertainment.","rating":"9\/10","date":"27 March 2020"}
{"title":"Our Evolving Stark Trek (edit)","review":"Philosophical, not theological.((They made it for everyone through a skillful weaving of legendary characters with newcomers, balance of theological content with wit and character development, and a bold motley of viewpoints reflecting the meeting of modern sci-fi with ancient mystique and timeless depth.))","rating":"9\/10","date":"5 June 2020"}
{"title":"Polarises opinions, but I love it.","review":"There are a lot of very negative reviews on here, but it's not really a surprise since this is a show that will polarise opinions. I love it however, for several reasons.Firstly, it IS Star Trek. It's not the camp, 60s Trek of Shatner and Nimoy but it follows the other series pretty well. Earth has been bombarded by the Borg, then there was the Dominion War in DS9. That series, for me some of the best Star Trek has to offer, was pretty dark and Picard follows on from that. It continues the themes of what sentient life is from the TNG episodes involving Data like Measure of a Man and his \"daughter\" Lal and the Voyager episodes about the Doctor and the rights of holograms. It has the Borg and the Romulans, the two biggest and baddest TNG bad guys in it. There are plenty of nods to the original series and those that follow like having Maddox, Seven of Nine, Hugh, the Tal Shiar et al all involved and it suits the way the modern viewer watches TV, wanting a continual storyline with character development and jeopardy rather than the episodic \"alien of the week\" way that stories had to be told in the days of syndication. I guess if you prefer that single, hour-long episodic melodrama then classic Trek is more to your taste than this.In terms of storyline, there is a long game to be played out and there are a lot of little set piece action scenes as well as plenty of opportunities for Sir Patrick Stewart to show his class by bringing a sensitivity and sense of age to the character we all love in Jean-Luc Picard. His age has caught up with him and he can't physically cope with the demands of the task but the old dreamer still thinks he has one last mission in him and will do everything he can to preserve the memory of his friend Data. I'm struggling to see how anyone can hate this show so much.Yes, there is swearing but coming from the UK it's always hilarious to me when US dramas have characters who DON'T swear (especially police procedurals, shows about drug dealers and the mafia etc) simply because of an outdated moral \"code\" on their network TV. Of course people in Star Trek didn't swear in the old TV shows but not being on network TV allows for a more realistic way of presenting the frustrations, hopes, fears and everything else than trying to avoid some naughty words. Yes, it's lefty, with its message about helping refugees and pointing out that a military organisation might not have the same interests as the general population or the more optimistic dreamers but Star Trek has always been that way and will always continue to be that way. And yes it has the lens flares and the Dutch angles and the non-linear storytelling but do we expect colourful sets and uniforms, cardboard sets and terrible lizards like the Original Series when filmmaking has come on for far in the 60 years since that time?Watch it, don't watch it; but don't believe all the haters who say it isn't Star Trek or that it's a muddled mess. It's not TNG, it's not DS9 but it is good. It's better than Enterprise, Voyager and Discovery. Give it a go if you're a Trek fan and I'm sure you'll enjoy it. And if you aren't a fan then watch it for Sir Patrick Stewart alone.","rating":"9\/10","date":"21 February 2020"}
{"title":"Dont subject yourself voluntarily to torture","review":"I tried to force myself to watch it but tonight I had to stop deluding myself, it won't pick up if it didn't pick up by now - 6th episode. This isn't just worst star trek series, it is very bad in general. Boring, very slow and stupid. Very disappointed! First they tortured us with Discovery and now with Picard.

{"title":"Blade Runner meets the Federation.","review":"I understand all the negative reviews, I just don't agree with them. I never really liked Star Trek because it WAS too sanitized & utopian. I personally like my SciFi very gritty and dark like Blade Runner or even Firefly. So, for me, this is the best Star Trek ever made. I do think some of the scenes are cringy and some of the acting is quite bad, but overall, I love this show.","rating":"8\/10","date":"23 February 2020"}
{"title":"Why did you stop watching Star Trek?","review":"Because it was no longer Star Trek!ST: Picard wants you to think that it takes Star Trek and the Federation in a new, darker direction. In reality, that happened 30 years ago with DS9. Every idea and issue discussed in this show was done more effectively in that or in TNG without distorting the Federation in an unrecognisable way.Back are poverty and paranoia. Absent from real Trek? Certainly not. Poverty rages on many planets. Not on earth, of course (but maybe Raffi just hasn't figured out how to use a replicator). Paranoia is handled masterfully in DS9 in a way that fits the canon and is more poignant than this show could hope to be.DS9 explores complex issues of identity and discrimination regarding genetically modified humans. That's reflected here in ST: Picard's discussion of synthetic life forms, but the former example fits in the world, and the latter is overblown and implausible given what we know about the Federation.Looking at this show in its own right, it moves like a sloth with a myriad of irrelevances and non sequiturs. It does nothing new and everything poorly.To be fair, it looks good. It's a shame it does, in a way - if this had a lower budget, CBS might have allowed some competent writers near a Star Trek series rather than seeking a beautiful but vapid crowd pleaser.Elevating this beyond the lowest possible score are a couple of watchable (and even, for some blissful minutes, enjoyable) episodes and some stellar costume design. There are some great new outfits and updates to old alien fashions. Most of these are seen on ancillary characters since the show is embarrassed to be Star Trek.Let us hope that the Federation finds a way to escape the grip of Alex Kurtzman.","rating":"2\/10","date":"9 February 2020"}
{"title":"It's good because it's different.","review":"It is not the usual enterprise pace which is great and refreshing. I was very cautious going into season 2 because of all the negative reviews. But it was actually very entertaining with great story twists and surprises which are connected to the StarTrek universe. Story is much wider with some appearance from old Enterprise episodes.Season 1 was good and picked up the story well, progressing it trough the episodes. Sure there were some lows in the story and weak episodes but that happens in every season of a TV show. Season 2 was very entertaining and had also some lows with \"monsters\" episode but still picked up a wider storyline and had great moments. Action, fun scenes and some emotional farewells.","rating":"9\/10","date":"6 February 2023"}
{"title":"Picard Season One Engages All","review":"I rented Picard Season One from the library and watched it over a few days. What a ride!I was a little apprehensive about what kind of story could be created around an aged senior like Picard, but boy, was this a terrific story.Picard is an Admiral retired to his vineyard in France until stuff starts to happen to him involving Data and AI life. Picard still has the fire to be useful so he starts asking questions. Before you know it, those questions bring reactions that increase Picard's curiousity even more and drive him to seek the truth, wherever it leads him.Along the way, it leads him to bring in Riker and Troi from his old TNG days. Data is along for the ride too, posthumously. Data is THE central character so it's nice to see him in flashbacks and other scenes. You even get 7 of 9 from Voyager and Jeri Ryan absolutely delivers!Picard assembles a rag-tag crew along the way, each person bringing something special to the mix. Picard has learned his limits with all that time has changed. There are many funny moments when you know that Picard only wants to do what he has earned, as he puts it. Those scenes make you chuckle. So as they jet around the universe trying to pull together the pieces of the puzzle, Picard is in the odd position of being in 'charge' but not really in 'command' because his technical skills have not kept up.Patrick Steward delivers an outstanding performance that should inspire aging actors to keep at it. There are roles where aging stars work with middle aging stars who work with new young talent, and that bridge\/mix of knowledge and strength and wisdom can be a powerful elixir of a story.It's also heartwarming to see the old TNG folks get together and reminisce about the old days. It makes viewers remember the good times we enjoyed, and it proves that true friendships endure not matter how much time passes and no matter where you are in the universe.I loved Picard Season One. I can't wait to watch the next seasons as they come available on DVD.If you liked TNG, you will love Picard Season One.Enjoy.","rating":"8\/10","date":"25 January 2023"}

{"title":"Almost As Bad As ST:Discovery","review":"Right off the bat I'll say, Vulgarity is unbecoming of Star Trek.And I can only hope the current crew of writers realize that before we get Star Trek:Commander Worf's Adventures In The Bajoran Cathouse.I slogged (hoped?) through 6 episodes of Discovery before realizing that it was not going to get any better and then headed to the escape pod. Will this make it to 7 episodes? After the second episode, it's not promising.After watching the first episode on Youtube I was at least hopeful that there would be a new Star Trek series that didn't randomly drop the F-bomb or other \"sentence enhancers\" that are the hallmark of lazy writing. It actually got me interested enough to watch episode 2. The story was kinda meh, but it did pique my interest.After watching episode 2 at a friend's house, it followed true to the new Star Trek form, profanity that was totally unneeded and apparently solely there to assure the audience that the \"tough\" female character is indeed \"tough\" because look at how \"tough\" her language is and everyone around her now knows for sure that she is \"tough\". Is a woke 14 year old writing this stuff?Makes it kinda hard to enjoy a show with my family.I only watch maybe 3 or 4 hours of TV a week so I'm picky about what I waste that time on. I'll give it another watch with episode 3, but if it continues on its current course it'll be beam me out of here.","rating":"3\/10","date":"6 February 2020"}
{"title":"Awesome show.","review":"Excellent show, tied up a LOT of loose ends from all the next gen series and much more as well. Lots of regulars are back and many unfinished stories are answered in all three seasons of this wonderful imaginative series. They kept with the original series ideas and characters with a few slight changes, but not too far off base. Each season has its own plot and twist as well as single story. They don't carry into each season, but each is a standalone story by themselves, which makes for far more fun and like reading a novel for each season. I found this particular entree into the Star Trek universe refreshing and quite a fun ride. I hope you will enjoy it as much as we did. There are a couple \"questionable\" scenes which can be skipped with your fast forward button. Enjoy!","rating":"10\/10","date":"25 April 2023"}

{"title":"For Season 3 only - A fitting end","review":"So the first two seasons were okay. The 3rd season though, is, like most series, where they've found their footing.And then it was over.A fitting end to the TNG crew? For me, yes. For others? Well, that's your choice.And potentially a new Star Trek series with the ending?Overall (and this is for me), I found the last series a must watch. Definitely a Cinema style, big budget look and feel. Good acting and all involved seemed genuinely pleased reviving and playing old characters.And you really do want to watch this on a bigger screen (50\" at least), with a decent sound setup.I watched one episode on a friends 32\" with just the tv speakers and the difference was very noticeable (and not in a good way!)Please note - my rating is for Season 3 ONLY and not the previous seasons.","rating":"8\/10","date":"21 April 2023"}
{"title":"S1 = dull, S2 = great, S3 = Star Trek!","review":"The third series is fantastic! It's The Next Generation with the original cast with the best storyline of the whole franchise. It manages to be original whilst being exactly as you remember the Picard era of Star Trek to be. No - I'd actually say better. If you watch some of those Next Generation episodes they're not as good as your memory tells you. Some are a bit slow, sentimental and wordy. This series doesn't disappoint, I'd say it's more exciting, more intriguing and more entertaining.The cast certainly have aged (and although an robot, Mr Data has inexplicably got quite chubby) but they wittily play up to this without resorting to any silly comedy and really seem to be enjoying themselves as you will.The second series was also pretty good too but series one was as dull as dishwasher.","rating":"10\/10","date":"21 May 2023"}
{"title":"Trolls...","review":"... don't like this show, I guess.I liked both seasons of ST Picard and am looking forward to season 3! Especially seaon 2 is a great arc about Picard's general motivation and yes, at some points it may be a bit cheesy, but over all the characters are very likeable.Is it the strongest of all ST shows - maybe not, but I honestly don't understand the nearly religous way some people think about the older series, which all had their flaws, but still all had their own charm.So if you like scifi and like ST in general, you should really give it a try without being to fixated on the idea that everything is fixed and has to be a certain way forever.And I like the couple at the end. ;-)","rating":"9\/10","date":"5 May 2022"}

{"title":"Rides the coattails of previous generations","review":"Summarized in two words - unnecessary and empty. The writing in the show is a far cry from the previous generations of Star Trek. It relies heavily on a big budget and nostalgia. Picard only provides fleeting glimpses of his former strengths, such as his morality and his ability to stand up for greater values. Patrick Stewart's acting is still top notch, providing only brief moments of genuine Star Trek feeling. Unfortunately, most of the time, the story feels empty, and the show lacks the higher purpose and morality that were once synonymous with Star Trek.Picard is portrayed as wanting to help, but there is no greater meaning or morality driving his actions. The show feels like a series of events, connected by special effects, rather than a cohesive narrative with a purpose.In previous Star Trek series, Earth, the Federation, and Starfleet represented a better future. Humanity had overcome poverty, and people worked towards self-improvement while fighting to maintain freedom and responsibility. However, \"Picard\" has abandoned this optimistic vision of the future, and there is little left of the principles that once made the Star Trek universe so captivating. Starfleet has lost its way. This lack of direction makes the show feel unnecessary and generic, as it could take place in any timeframe with little to no change in the plot.Picard falls short of the expectations set by previous Star Trek series. The lack of purpose and morality, along with the absence of a clear antagonist, make the show feel hollow and unnecessary. While there are some moments of nostalgia for Picard, they are not enough to make up for the show's shortcomings.","rating":"3\/10","date":"19 April 2023"}

It is brought up to date and very exciting. There are two things that I wish were different (but won't stop me from watching) 1. the music is too loud throughout the entire show. It is very distracting. 2. I wish every episode was a \"stand alone\" episode like the other Star Treks. I would love to be able to have a single story for each different episodes. You don't get that anymore in shows.The acting is great. The special effects are out of this world. The concept is so crazy good!

A decent first season of Picard and an OK follow up to Star Trek Universe especially Next Generation and Voyager.\nA decent mystery and a well handled makes for a decent show but does fall a little flat towards the end.I really liked the idea this show has and the mystery of the show is really well handled involving the Synthetics and the Romulans.\nThe build up to the mystery is much better than the reveal and it does fall a little flat towards the end of the show.I really like the way old characters are handled here.\nSeven of Nine and Riker were amazing and it was amazing to see there life's after Next Generation and Voyager there's some great moments with them especially Seven of Nine who's always a personal favourite of mine.The ending was OK but does fall a little short.\nI really like the goodbye between Data and Piccard it was a great moment that I felt worked as closure for that character and was something we didn't Nemesis.Not a fan of how they braught back Piccard it seemed a little rushed and an easy way out to bring him back also kinda made a little pointless in my opinion and does kinda fall flat.Also the Borg cube in the show dosent really serve any purpose in the end and this was annoying it build up and was so interesting but in the end didn't serve any purpose. That was a little disappointing in my opinion I did like Seven of Nine becoming part of the hive again but even that was wasted because they kill the Borg of really dissapointing.\nA decent show in my opinion and a good follow on for the Star Trek universe there was stuff i really liked and stuff I didn't and the show did fall a little flat in my opinion but a decent show than can be grown on.Verdict 8\/10 a decent return to Star Trek with an Interesting mystery and some great character moments but the show does fall flat in the end.\nThe show can improve though and does show potential.","rating":"8\/10","date":"28 March 2020"}
{"title":"Stop and go watch TOS, TNG, DS9 and Voyager","review":"I see a lot of positive reviews, don't get fooled by them, maybe there are a few kids lost among the human boot farms from Asia, and I don't blame them, they are the target demographic for the comments coming from those boot farms, but most of the comments are fabricated, and I urge those who have genuine comments and ratings not to start with this show as a reference about Star Trek!If you really watched TOS, TNG, DS9 or Voyager, this comment is not for you, you already dislike STD and Picard.\nIf you glanced with one eye or with a nine year old mind at TOS, TNG, DS9 or Voyager and you fancy yourself a \"trekkie\" or a scifi aficionado go watch them again maybe you will get it this time.\nIf you never touched the Star Trek phenomenon before and want to start with Picard, STOP and go watch TOS, TNG, DS9 and Voyager.So onto the \"masterpice\"...\nIs it stupidity? Is it greed? Is it a master plane to destroy the franchise? First two for sure, the third... who knows?\nBut what I do know is that this is a telenovela, written by telenovela screen writers. Telenovelas have one purpose: to lower the plot to the lowest IQ common denominator and keep the maximum amount of people engaged with a series of never ending puzzles that could maybe be threaded into a bigger puzzle if you are lucky. This is basically Picard, a space telenovela with Trek easter eggs...\nOld Star Trek was unapologetically at a higher level, You either got it or you didn't, and it was fine either way. It presented a bright vision of the future, not perfect but full of hope, it tackled hard social issues long before it was cool in Hollywood, it had lots of tech that inspired generations of engineers, and I can go on forever...\nI am sure that some people involved with picard had good intentions and tried to tackle current day issues as an allegory in this series but to do that they joined hands with greedy talent-less self serving sociopaths that only have one skill: playing the Hollywood corporate game.\nSo welcome to Ferenginar everybody, put your 7 strips of latinum in the amazon box and be entertained with the amazing fear of AI, the great struggle of emigration and the great scare of governments and organizations, wrapped in a mystery box, wrapped in another mystery box, cloned from a single neuron that was actually a positron, all gift wrapped in a 'member box.","rating":"3\/10","date":"14 February 2020"}

To me Picard is finally an ending to a chapter in this part of the original Next Gen. A story that has to be finished. The new cast is refreshing and the easter eggs are nice.

{"title":"A bit more up to date","review":"At first I didn't want to see the series. I thought it would be a retake of the old TNG series with its one-episode stories and flat characters.\nLet's face it: Star Trek TNG is outdated. It was hyped by its worshippers for tackling world issues. But in these modern age you know human relations are more complicated than how they were depicted in TNG. Moreover important issues aren't handled with the ease you see in TNG.\nOf course Sar Trek: Picard also ends with its kumbaya ending. But frankly, the rest of the series makes it digestable. You start with a detective, a puzzle that needs solving. The story keeps you wondering what will happen in the next episode. That alone already makes it more modern that the original series.\nPatrick Stewart's cracked voice needs a bit getting used to. The actor is getting old and you notice it. Of course he's a great actor but that doesn't mean it's credible to have a man of his age running around and fighting the way his character is.\nNevertheless it's nice how they didn't do a retake on the old concept and tried to make it more realistic. Does it succeed completely? No. Most characters are still a bit one-dimensional and the ending is all too simple. But still, an enjoyable show in its totallity.","rating":"8\/10","date":"21 May 2020"}

With an alien of the week. It's a long story. But you need that after such a long time between stories.You can't go do the same thing. It will lack substance. Now something has to be resolved. Picard has to find his hope and hopefully the second season can go on with more hope and a bright future.People who complaine about the grittyness ehm .... the Borg always been gritty and other aliens the same. But eventhough there are bad people and sometimes dark episodes in histories. We always resolve it and become beter people in the and.... we are still evolving, try to do beter and that's also the message from Startrek.","rating":"9\/10","date":"29 February 2020"}
{"title":"Really wanted to like it but it's just not Star Trek","review":"The only* reason I'm giving this three out of ten is because of Patrick Stewart. He's older and obviously has lost some of his range and energy, but he's still Picard.The rest of it is dull and disappointing and feels more like Discovery (which is rubbish) than it does TNG which is what it should feel at least somewhat similar too, after all mere decades have passed.My wife and I used to watch TNG every Sunday night as a bit of a ritual when it first aired and we've rewatched it in recent years for a bit of nostalgia so we were both looking forward to seeing Picard and perhaps a little of the old cast from time to time as well in this sequel.We watched the first three episodes with diminishing enthusiasm and basically haven't really found the interest to watch any more since.Shame really, but I guess that due to Kurtzman and Bad Reboot that Trek as we knew it is well and truly dead and we'll just have to learn to accept that.*Well not only, no point putting 1 out of 10 IMDB ignores those in its metrics.","rating":"3\/10","date":"4 March 2020"}

{"title":"Snowball","review":"This series was made as a snowball that keeps rolling into an enormous show. People might not have instantly gotten a good old fashioned TNG S8 show they were probably expecting, but they seemed to have a good reason for it. It's not episodic type series, but a big package show that keeps unwrapping. I do believe you have to binge watch this to fully enjoy it.","rating":"10\/10","date":"16 May 2022"}

{"title":"I wait all week for the next episode","review":"I waited a few weeks before weighing in because I did not want to just give a knee jerk reaction to one or two episodes. First off, the series does start slowly and a little lack luster. Now looking back I can see they were setting a mood. It had been twenty years and Picard was walled off from the world in his vineyard sulking in his failure and morning the loss of his friend Data. Enter Soji and we find our old captain is still in there somewhere just need in a push to get back in to the action.We find Star Fleet is no longer a socialist utopia but a broken shell of its former self that has been infiltrated by Romulin spies. To get things done Picard must rely of former friends and one time allies. Is this point the show reminded me a little bit of Fierfly.The show does have a mature rating so I was not surprised by a few f- boms, while they were technically not necessary they did feel \"human\" to me. The violence is more real than TNG and I can understand some not liking it, but in my opinion it was not graphic or sensationalized I would call it tv14.At the end of today's episode I yelled at my tv because I didn't want the episode to end and I can't wait for next week. In a world of binge watching I hate having to wait for the next episode but when a story is this good and the writing and acting is this good I will gladly wait.Final thought, with Star Trek : Picard and Discovery, The Mandalorian, and a possible Sg1 reboot. Could we be on the cusp of a Syfy renaissance? I hope so.","rating":"9\/10","date":"28 February 2020"}
{"title":"Another not Star Trek series...","review":"Most Star Trek series are nice because of the combination of a whole story in one or two episodes, dynamical actors and being able to successfully mix scifi with a dose of humor.\nBoth STD and Picard failed on these attracting characteristics that made all the other series work.\nBetween the two, I stick with The Orville!","rating":"4\/10","date":"7 March 2020"}
{"title":"Redemption Franchise","review":"I was surprised watching this as I was never a Patrick Stewart fan and thought Next Generation was rubbish and only Data was a well acted and a decent character.This franchise redeemed Star Trek after the awfully exclusive Discovery which alienated its long term fans who appreciated Star Trek's inclusivity (without the politics)Picard was mostly not in space or on a space station but on earth for something different and delved into the time line continuum type story.They gave lots of cameos to previous cast across a few franchises and also brought in a few from other sci-fi shows.This isn't ground breaking sci-fi or a relaunch of Star Trek but is very watchable as I was able to watch 2 series in 7 days. Pretty much the only knock was it kept going back and forth into his childhood too randomly and way to often.","rating":"8\/10","date":"28 December 2022"}
{"title":"Great show.","review":"Ignore the naysayers. Most of them were clearly hoping for ST:TNG part two, despite the show makers clearly stating that's not what this would be.Picard is in the last few years of his useful life, and he's hoping to have one last positive effect on a Starfleet and Federation that has lost its way.The opening scene in the first episode sets up the story perfectly, Picard and Data enjoying a friendly game in Ten Forward on the old Enterprise D. Picard is clearly pining for the old days when Starfleet was a noble and peaceful institution, rather than the increasingly political and cautious entity it has slowly changed into.Picard change anything from the helm of a mighty starship anymore, so he has to do it with the resources at hand. The new characters are intriguing so far, with plenty of their own baggage. You won't find the easy camaraderie of TNG here yet. This is a ship with a crew that has to sort some issues out first.The show takes a little while to get moving, but as of episode five, it seems to be well on its way. Plenty of Easter eggs too that fans of the old series will love.If you're a fan of of Star Trek, give it a shot. And don't be put off the the darker ambience, the show is building toward a better future, not handing it to you immediately like the old series did.","rating":"9\/10","date":"22 February 2020"}
{"title":"At last, a real Star Trek","review":"Not that whiny teen drama called Star Trek Discovery, but a Star Trek worthy of the name.Great acting, sympathetic characters, and excellent scripts. Adults making decisions with real consequences. And when necessary, being absolutely brutal.Yes it makes a silly politically correct decision, but I don't think Hollywood can help itself. So one star off.Lets hope the Captain Pike spin-off takes lessons from this series.","rating":"8\/10","date":"18 May 2020"}
{"title":"Wouldn't call myself a massive trek fan but really enjoying this","review":"Started watching this because I like Patrick Stuart as an actor so thought I would give it a go and I really like what I'm seeing so far.

{"title":"Don't waste your time","review":"Hugely disappointing for a Star Trek fan and boring for those who aren't. Poor storyline and badly directed. There are only 2 camera shots, extremely close up or a medium shot. The only difference between the races are their costumes. Romulans with Irish accents and cracking jokes. Star fleet admiral's swearing. They try and mask the boring story with over the top drama and emotion. It doesn't work. Every character of power is a woman of ethnicity. I am a strong independent women who can do anything.","rating":"1\/10","date":"8 February 2020"}
{"title":"Solid series. Really enjoyed it. Picard still has it, even though time has passed.","review":"I watched reruns of the original series as a kid, then TNG aired in my late teens. Loved that show, and DS9, Voyager and even liked Enterprise. So I grew up with Picard, and the cast of TNG. Watching this was more than nostalgic. It was very good.Series does a great job of showing that things can change, and sometimes people don't adapt as well as they could. If fear controls you, bad decisions are the result. Picard proves this in spades. That is the way of the Romulans--secrecy and fear. Even Star Fleet can lose it's way--temporarily, and might need to be brought back in line with it's principals.I found the series to be refreshing. It wasn't filled with ideological pureness. I know some people are upset about that. Instead, it showed what can happen to lofty aspirations when they bump up against fear and cynicism. This series did a great job of showing that contrast and it's effects. How the Prime Directive itself can be ignored if fear and hysteria of an unknown takes over. Then, how reason can once again take root.To me, that hits Rodenberry's main theme on the bullseye. So those saying this missed his vision, I say hogwash. It just approached it from a different angle, but respected it all the same. Sometimes people make mistakes, lose their way, and struggle. But our best impulses can help us rise above in time. That is what this series is about. Overcoming fear to be out best selves. Even Star Fleet is not immune from losing its way.","rating":"8\/10","date":"6 May 2020"}
{"title":"Oh Dear - Wrecked by the 'F Word'","review":"This highly-anticipated series started so well. In fact, it was incredibly impressive both with the writing and visuals. BUT then came episode 2. What came from the seeds of a generally family-friendly show in the days of The Next Generation (admittedly with a few exceptions), has now mutated into yet another vehicle for the current agenda of bringing scenes of bedroom intimacy and obscene language to a family audience. We were shocked and turned the TV off rather quickly when the language turned blue (after having already skipped through a rather salacious scene!). Our family feel totally let down by the new series, as stooping to such base lows was completely unnecessary for a family-viewing show and rather than enhancing the plot, served instead to disgust and disappoint. A very sad turn for morally-minded STTNG fans.","rating":"1\/10","date":"31 January 2020"}
{"title":"A Voyager fan here","review":"I have little to no knowledge about Star Trek TV shows and movies outside of Voyager. I am familiar with the characters a little bit but it did not took anything from the enjoyment.\nShow establishes the story and lore needed to know to be entertained by Picard so it is easy to understand even for audience outside of already established fan base.Occasionally there are a bit dull moments, mostly connected to actor performances and visually it a bit sterile like new episodes of Red Dwarf but still. Worth watching.","rating":"8\/10","date":"29 March 2020"}
{"title":"It's a good show","review":"I am shocked by all the 1 star reviews for this show. Yes it's a different format than the Star Trek norm (I am a trekky since way back and seen them all) and yes season 2 is not as good as season 1 but I don't get the hate. This show does definitely not deserve a 1. 6 or 7 out of 10 maybe, but definitely not a 1.This is a quality production, with solid special effects, great costumes and good individual acting. It is a bit self indulgent and in season 2 the childhood flashback\/psychological arc was over laboured, but they are really only minor detractions from an interesting story and some great action scenes. I still felt emerged in the Star Trek universe watching this show and enjoyed it. Don't listen to the haters, I think it is worth the watch and seeing what they have install for season 3.","rating":"8\/10","date":"1 June 2022"}

{"title":"Probably my favourite Star Trek series","review":"I have to say I've seriously enjoyed all three series of \"Star Trek: Picard\".Series 1 sets up the missing years and events effectively but also adds a nice arc of a story around the rights of synthetic beings.Series 2 sees the return of Q and forces Picard and his new friends into a situation where they must travel back in time to rectify what ever caused a divergence in time.Series 3 sees Picard trying to come to terms with the news that he has a son when another old adversary, hiding behind another old adversary The Changelings proves capable of eliminating all sentient life. To achieve this Picard slowly builds up his old Bridge Crew to assist, along with the newer faces introduced previously.The final episode of series three is a brilliant piece of drama and had one of best sets (yes, more than one) of epilogues I've ever seen.The acting and production values on this series is exceptional. The script holds up.Seeing so many familiar faces was a real treat.Very highly recommended.","rating":"9\/10","date":"23 April 2023"}

{"title":"So much potential with many highs but in the end left me cold and bored","review":"I like Star Trek and have watched all of them, even the diabolical Star Trek: Discovery and the mediocre Star Trek: EnterpriseI don't remember everything about Series 1 and Series 2 of Picard, but I remember enough to know I enjoyed them. I liked Raffi, Elnor, Rios, Jurati and of course Seven of Nine. I had rated this show 9\/10 prior to watching the 3rd Season but I had to reduce my rating to 8\/10 due to the last 3 and a half episodes of Season 3I do not understand how the last 3 plot-hole ridden, contrived, travesties of episodes garnered top ratings (8.7, 9.4 and 9.4), when they were the worst episodes of the entire production. Some of the most disappointing and cringe-worthy TV I've ever endured. If it wasn't Star Trek and the last 3 episodes, I would have turned off my TVThe Dominion are interesting characters, at least they used to be. The Changelings are powerful, devious, fun. The Jem'Hadar are a cross between Clingon and Borg - fearsome warriors with artificial enhancements. As General Martok said: \"They're worthy fighters; but they have no sense of honour\". Even the Vorta are intriguing, like Weyoun from DS9What pray tell are these characters in Picard? The Captain Changeling lady Vadic is quite interesting and well acted but her persona is out of character with all other Changelings. OK, she was tortured by Star Fleet and was altered but she's still a Changeling. How can we reconcile Vadic with the characters of Odo and the Female Changeling\/Founders? What about the mysterious leader that Vadic is taking instruction from? None of it adds up, you would think Vadic and her soldiers were an entirely different race. Why are Vadic's crew talking in click language?Vadic's crew are Changelings as they morphed on the bridge of the Titan but why are they not Jem'Hadar or Vorta? The Changelings\/Founders are too important and revered as gods to be mere foot soldiers or be summarily executed by their own kind. What happened that they forgot how to speak English? How are they so easily defeated by Star Fleet personnel including Jack Crusher? Why on some occasions can they survive a dozen phaser blasts and on others they conveniently die with one shot? There is no consistency to their character or persona at all even within Picard let alone compared with other series like DS9, which a lot of people will have seenNow onto the most annoying part. The Borg. Did they get the writers in from ST: Discovery to cover the Borg? It was so cringeworthy and incomprehensible. The Borg Queen was a total disappointment in the final season especially compared to the Queen from Voyager and Picard season 2. Is the Queen supposed to be the same one as Voyager, is it supposed to be Jurati? How exactly is she running a ship as enormous as that Cube with no drones? Then to create false tension, when Worf and Riker are approaching their objective, suddenly there are fully functional drones? These drones look fine but act and move wrongThe plan to take over Star Fleet is stupid based on previous Trek lore. There is no chance that code can be inserted into transporters to assimilate the younger crew. There are records stored on Starships and at central command, any changes would set off a million alarms. Don't get me started on the age 25 cut-off which conveniently lets all the main characters remain assimilation immune.These \"Borg\" after they are assimilated\/activated on Frontier Day, what is that supposed to be? It was entirely contrived and lacking in drama or suspense of any kind. When their connection to Jack Crusher\/Borg Queen\/Cube is severed, they all instantly recover? I understand every Star Trek series is slightly different but that annoyed me. Spontaneous assimilation and de-assimilation. They didn't inspire fear or sympathy like previous Borg, who are my favourite characters in all of Star Trek. The Borg were ruined by the end of Picard, not acting correctly, not saying the right things, not being even remotely scary. If anything I felt sorry for these Borg when they should be the characters we love to hate, not empathise with.The end-game storyline with Jack Crusher was cringe and incomprehensible. Suddenly he's like a superhero with absurd abilities that remained hidden from one of the best doctors in Star Fleet - his mother Beverly Crusher - for his entire life? We're expected to believe that a civilisation that has warp drives and replicators, which require the energy equivalency of an entire galaxy to operate, can make such basic mistakes when they are convenient to the story line? We're supposed to believe that Jack Crusher is a broadcaster of instructions due to his unique physiology, yet these abilities work on regular humans who have no cybernetic implants nor the same inherent biological tech? What about JL Picard himself, why can he not broadcast instructions, take over the mind of others, or combat his son? Remember the storyline is Jack inherited these abilities from Picard, who at one point was fully Borg and could still hear the collective after he was de-assimilated.Data. What did you do to Data? You monsters. Data is Data, he is not Lore, not human. The Discovery writers wanted a woke robot with subjective feelings more important than objective reality. The scene with Data and Lore had quite an intelligent storyline behind it with Data offering his most important personal connections to Lore in order to defeat him by reverse-psychological assimilation, but the contrived animations showing this with the red and blue dots on a screen and the reactions of the crew, not to mention the conveniently perfect timing of it all, annoyed me greatly. Why did we not get to see Data, \"the incredibly violent and dangerous AI Security System\"? Could we not have seen Data go on a rampage like a Battle Droid? In the end his character was entirely unrelatable and irritating as we love the Data from TNG, not this new human-like Data. It was so predictable and trope.La Forge? I quite enjoyed the younger La Forges but Geordie? Why did they make him into a negative Ned coward and how did his story arc so quickly from one extreme based on principle to the other? Again all too convenient and predictable, everything felt contrived to match the direction of the story lineDeanna Troi was very annoying and predictable. As a TNG fan of course I liked Counsellor Troi but nothing about her or her part in the storyline felt real. Sure it's a sci-fi series and not meant to be a documentary but you should be able to suspend your disbelief and enjoy it for what it is. I was unable to suspend my disbelief for the last 3 and a half episodes, all I could think about was what was wrong with what I was watching rather than being able to enjoy itThe ending for me was too predictable and lacking in tension. I thoroughly enjoyed the first 6 episodes of Picard Season 3, I thought it was on track to do something special, however, in the end I was severely let down by some of the characters and the atrocious writing. There could have been real tension, heartache, loss and then exhilaration when things went right but all of it was missing for me. I felt nothing.What was with the fight scenes between ships and personnel? Are phasers deadly or a dead arm? Do photon torpedoes cause damage or annihilation? Why is it Titan can survive a full volley or \"everything they have\" and remain structurally uncompromised while the Shrike, which was stated on numerous occasions to vastly outmatch the Titan, was blown into a billion pieces by the same volley of the same ammunition? Stupid, incoherent, incomprehensible, contrived, utter nonsense.What was the craic with Captain Shaw? Is he schizophrenic? He kept swaying from rock to water and back again at the drop of a hat. Often he was unlikeable then he had flashes of likeability only to revert back to being unlikeable. I didn't care if he lived or died, it was like 3 different writers wrote him 3 separate personalities.Worf was one of the best characters, the scene when he rescues Raffi was great. Raffi was also good. Seven of Nine is always welcome but felt underpowered somehow relative to her status and abilities in Voyager and earlier seasons of Picard. Riker was passable. Beverly was good. Jack was excellent in spots but let down by the atrocious writing at the end. The main man Picard was not without fault. It's hard to listen to the old man speak sometimes. I wondered more than once while watching Admiral Picard set off on a journey, \"I wonder if he's going to drop dead before they finish filming?\" I don't say that flippantly and I love Picard, I like Patrick Stewart, but that was not the JL Picard from TNG. Once again his character felt somewhat schizophrenic and even unlikeable at times. I can't blame Patrick Stewart for being old but I can blame the writers for not giving him a more suitable storyline. He should have been more like Professor X from X-Men, not an 80 year old Picard trying to act like a 50 year old PicardSo while overall I'm glad I watched all 3 Seasons of this series, I was so disappointed with the last 3 and a bit episodes that it made me write this review, which is the only review I've ever written on IMDB despite being a member for 14 years.","rating":"8\/10","date":"16 June 2023"}

{"title":"I don't feel that this is a superior story direction for Star Trek","review":"I was hoping that this would bring Star Trek back on course. But it has further destroyed the quality of the story. I have numerous problems with the series.Aesthetics - There are some good visuals. But they are marred by lenses flairs, pacing issues and odd angles. It's like they are trying to throw in similar visual trickery as done in the 2009 movie. But it makes the series more chaotic than it needs to be. And it makes it look less realistic.Tech - Some of the new and updated tech is interesting but some are just plain ridiculous. In 1 part of episode 2, a scanner is used which recreates past activity. That's too far into the Harry Potter style fantasy style.Story - I want to first say that I dislike how the story is so dependent on events in the 2009 Star Trek movie. I did not like that movie and wish that the Picard story would gloss over the \"Prime\" events of that movie. But going beyond that, it's too negative for my tastes. Plus they disclose the villains of the story way too early. It's almost like they are going for kind of a Blade Runner style but don't add the necessary elements to the story to make it work. I liked Blade Runner and that could work to a degree in Star Trek if the writing was better. But there is a lot of stuff which is too much like what has been done elsewhere.There is something better - I have read some of the Star Trek books which cover the post-Nemesis period and well into the future. There are flaws but the direction of the books is far superior to this.I am a fan of Patrick Stewart and others from TNG. I hope the best for them, both inside and outside this series. Actually, I like most of the parts with Patrick Stewart. Yet, he can't carry this series alone. The inferior elements of the story cancel out his contributions. I am going to stop watching this series. The soft reboot of the movies, Discovery and even Enterprise have tainted the story too much for me to watch this. I may have to do with Star Trek what I did with Star Wars. That is to settle on the original story line done in the books. I am OK with new directions, seriously. But the stories have to be better than what has already been done. And, at this time, I am not feeling that Picard is the superior story.I would also like to add that there are more progressive ways to portray negative aspects of modernity than how this show does it. You can still have positivity while tackling the issues. Getting too pessimistic does not get us past the negativity. But I think that, in a way, this show is a reflection of how people have difficulties seeing the current mix of good and bad that we have. Yes, there is a lot of negative stuff. But I think that they are like weeds which we let get out of hand in a garden. We can save the garden if we deal with the details. Excessive negativity can actually destroy that which we want to save.I never returned to the first season. After disliking the beginning, I monitored the story. Nothing indicated that it was going in a better direction. Now, the season 2 trailers have come out. The main story arc is going to involve time travel and alternative time lines. These are overused and cheap story elements. I won't be returning for season 2.","rating":"3\/10","date":"31 January 2020"}

{"title":"Losing hope..","review":"When I was a child I had unrealistic notions about social and moral progress. I imagined, for example, that problems like racism and poverty would have just disappeared by the time I was grown up. How could humans continue to be so awful to each other? Star Trek gave me a lot to look forward to.Of course, I realize now that I won't live to see the type of society I'd like to see. So much about our nature threatens that Star Trek future, but that's part of the reason I was so excited Picard was coming back. Even if we can't be those evolved humans, maybe it'd help us to at least have them there as examples to aspire toward. My generation couldn't manage it, perhaps we could inspire a new generation.The production value of the series is great, the acting leaves nothing to complain about, but I just watched two humans straight up kill two others, brutally and for silly reasons. The universe this show is set in is every bit as bleak, dreary and hateful as the real world.I think hope for our species has never seemed as far away to me as it does right now when we can't even dream of it anymore.","rating":"5\/10","date":"20 February 2020"}
{"title":"I loved it.","review":"I see the negative reviews, but I remember when TNG came out. People were badly comparing it to Star Trek of the 1960s. Then they loved it. Then they hated the idea of Deep Space 9 and Voyager! I see this as a sort of drawn out movie or even an alt reality. (Wasn't 7-of-9 meant to end up with Chicote?) Patrick Stewart looks frail, and indeed he's meant to be 94. But I loved seeing him, and the others from TNG and Voyager. I loved hating the baddies. I loved it when Seven hooked into the Borg system and said \"We are the Borg!\" I got that cold chill of deliciousness that the Borg could kick some Romulenbutt!! I even loved the delicate opening with the piece of sky cracking and falling. Clearly this will not be a 10 year series. But even if it's just the one...

{"title":"This isn't Star Trek","review":"The problem with pulling a character like this back onto TV is that we expect a similar product... But Sci-Fi has changed since TNG.We used to get stand-alone episodes that explored scientific and philosophical boundaries. This is -as many other people have said- a single, slow, boring story. There's a nod toward us eventually seeing a discussion about life, but TNG would have had the gusto to have that conversation within the opening 10 minutes.This is drab Space Opera. Like Discovery and yet somehow worse. The few stars I give this are purely sentimental, imbued with the hope that it'll speed up, get a grip and be something good one day.The Orville remains the only true Trek in production.","rating":"3\/10","date":"6 March 2020"}
{"title":"Flawed but brilliant","review":"Those who hate the show do so because they expected another Star Trek. And this is not (for that rather watch The Orville). It doesn't have larger than life characters, eternal optimism, or quick and punchy storytelling. It's much darker and introspective than the Star Trek of age. The pace is slower. But the show is also full of beautiful dialogue, some top notch acting by some cast members (e.g., Harry Treadaway), and an interesting story delivered over the course of the season. And has just the right amount of nostalgia for TNG lovers out there (myself included).Initially, I thought Patrick Stewart was really too old to reprise the role (and you can see that or hear it in his voice). But the writers didn't package him the same role he had in the past, for which he would have failed. They told the tale of an old Picard, and very nicely so. If it hadn't been for the \"too much happy ending\" of Season 1, I would have given it 9 stars.Not sure how they can bring this forward, but I definitely enjoyed the season.","rating":"8\/10","date":"24 April 2020"}

{"title":"True story Bro","review":"I really like this show and it's empowering too so I hope you check it out. I don't know about how it fits in the spirit of former series' because I haven't seen much of star trek, but there's a lot of realism in the storyline and if you doubt it, read up on transhumanism and you may start to see that this is inline with the current state of affairs in the world and galaxy.I think people should know that what you see in the show is already a reality and that the danger our world faces from nefarious forces is real and must be addressed and stopped.I'm looking forward to watching the rest of season 1 and moving on to other star trek because I'm hooked. Someone said that it was bleak or lacking optimism, and that is true halfway through the first season. I hope that changes, but I think they have the right approach because it is a dark tale and there's everything at stake.Thank you bros!","rating":"10\/10","date":"12 June 2023"}

I was very worried that Patrick Stewart was anti trump so i was on guard for leftist social justice group narcissism. Thankfully, it wasnt there. the writers, instead went for discovery vs trying to tell you what to think, which is in true star trek fashion, they do come to a conclusion, but there is room for you to discover and look at things differently.Great work fellows. keep it coming and keep it about discovery, and observation, do not be polluted by left wing propaganda. remember, if a idea needs to be sold, its not the truth.

{"title":"A different Star Trek - different Picard.","review":"I love the series. It meshes in well with the future as seen in Abrams reboot where Romulus has been destroyed by a super nova.Picard has aged and it shows. He has had losses with regard to the Federation and what he thinks he can achieve in his career. Picard has settled into an uneasy retirement until an unusual young women shows up in his life asking for his help. She is assassinated by the Romulan secret police, the Tal Shiar , and the adventure beings.Picard gathers a rag tag team and spaceship to find and save the women's twin sister. Two of the crew are ex-star fleet who have had their own bad experiences with Starfleet.The series premise appears to me to be, \"Lets look at people in Starfleet who crashed and burned in their career.\" So this is not Star Trek Next Generation where everybody is clearly a social being who all most universally succeeds.

It does not remotely have the essence of what makes Star Trek unique and special. Picard is simply some studio exec's idea of how to draw in the throngs of Star Trek fans for the purpose of profit.

Has anybody at CBS seen where Captain Picard is now? Because I've yet to identify him anywhere within this new self titled television series.You know, come to think of it, the entire Star Trek universe appears to have been blown into oblivion by some unreported Super Nova, because that's frankly the only explanation I can come up with, when considering what you folks seem to believe Star Trek is, or is not. I can tell you this for sure though; the concept of whatever this is supposed to be, isn't good, at all. It's not escapism, it's not science fiction, it's not fun, it's not hopeful of anything, and it's certainly not Star Trek as a result. So yeah, good luck with that.....I'll just watch The Orville to get my Star Trek fix. Because I'm done with, whatever \"this\" is.......c-ya.","rating":"1\/10","date":"11 March 2020"}

{"title":"A refreshing Star Trek series?","review":"Star Trek at time's for me is a little bit Marmite. Some of the films and series I find enjoyable and some not so. I get bored of the MacGuyver escapes from certain doom in a lot of the Star Trek universe.Picard has had many positive reviews but also plenty of hate, I personally enjoyed the chance to engage with some familiar characters without too much MacGuyver moments saving the day.The story line is interesting and steady paced. There's plenty drama, twists, humour and suspense. Some complaints have focused on the profanity, but in this modern world, I think it's more realistic to include. A pet hate of mine was when films use to get the swearing overdubbed on TV. I remember watching the original Robocop on TV and swearing like 'F' words were replaced with words like 'Freaky' and it just didn't work - it was terrible. Unless the TV shows and Movies are for younger audiences, I don't expect them to avoid profanity and have no issues with it being in Star Trek.They can't just keep churning put new Star Trek using only the original formula. They have to try new things to keep it fresh and connect with new audiences.Picard gets a big thumbs up from me and I'm looking forward to see what Season 2 will bring.","rating":"8\/10","date":"7 April 2020"}

JL meets the ExB's, and all the characters are abbreviations of themselves -- none are full characters. Even Picard is a an ineffectual abbreviation of himself. Alex Kurtzman, Avika Goldsman and Michael Chabon, if you are listening, this is a Star Trek comic strip that you are writing. Dr. Noonian Soong's \"lost\" son should hook up with Spock's \"lost\" sister. I heard somewhere that they filmed 10-12 hours over the course of Picard Season 1 and then when they worked their way through 2\/3 of the footage, they realized it didn't make any sense, so they went back and re-filmed parts and re-edited. It's still not making much sense. Why be creative, when you can just \"borrow\" from Mass Effect, Battlestar Galactica, Blade Runner, Star Wars, etc. This is Star Trek in name only, and even with that said, the character development, writing, story plotting and continuity is anemic.","rating":"2\/10","date":"20 March 2020"}
{"title":"Worth watching even if just to get to the final episode","review":"This is a review of the first two seasons of Star Trek: Picard with a focus on the second season. Overall Season 1 was unsettled. Season 2 was much better and the last 15 minutes of the final episode of season 2 is some of the most emotional for Trek fans.KEY POINT. Even with two seasons of Picard, we still only have less episodes than one season of TNG. Having said that both seasons follow one story arc with some subplots so they are able to tell that one story without stand-alone episodes.SEASON ONE. I was not a fan of Season 1. It was a little all over the place but it was only 10 episodes and trying to introduce new characters and a ST universe history that we needed to know since we last saw that universe at the end of the TNG movies. I didn't dislike it but it had its flaws. For me the worst thing was not seeing Picard as an old man but an old man making flawed decisions.The major subplot in season one regarding the Borg cube overall has no relevance to the whole season.NEW CAST\/CREW. I didn't like some of them in Season 1 but they were okay. Every series has had some crew we don't like. In Season 2 we got to know some of them better and the actors were better in their parts and I think better written. My major complaint about season 2 is that when we meet up again with all the crew, they are in positions of authority that don't naturally flow from when we saw them only 1.5 years previously. Of the minor characters from season one, Orla Brady (Laris) has a more prominent role in season two and I really like this character and the actor. I want to go see more of her filmography.SEASON TWO.. Like any TV series there are parts that feel stretched, some filler and a bit tired. A car chase for example. A cute kid. The intervention of the FBI.But the worst writing is really only mediocre television. Some of the best writing is very good. In some ways it seems like an extremely long episode or movie stretched over nearly 10 hours. There is new content for fans who don't want to live in the past and there is a number of references to old Trek that will satisfy older fans.The subplot about Picard's past gets a little boring at times and overall seems unnecessary. Of course it is necessary to see Picard determine what to do with the key at the end and thus complete that circle. For once a Q plot actually makes some emotional sense.ANALOGIES. Star Trek in every series, has used sci-fi to reflect real world problems. Picard does the same especially in season 2. The issues of a divided world, hatred towards \"others\", damaging our environment are all very strong subplots with the analogy not being very well hidden. In some ways it has the subtilty of some old TOS episodes..Q APPEARS. Season 2 opens with Q arriving. That casting was all over the internet before the season aired and certainly after it aired. It's not a big spoiler as he shows up before the credits in the first episode. That alone made me not want to watch this season. I've never liked Q and usually don't watch his episodes in re-runs. I thought it was a mistake bringing him back. But I thought I'd tolerate him to get through the season. The reality is that I really liked Q this time. Some of his comments, in typical Q throw-away fashion, were emotional enough that it changed how I see him. I actually want to go back and rewatch the Q episodes as I have a different perspective on him now. I am very impressed that with some very limited screen time, the writers were able to change my opinion of Q.SURPRISES. There are some surprises in the series especially in the last episode that harken back to old Trek. Wesley's short scene was a major highlight and I plan to rewatch the TNG Traveller episode as my memory tells me that this small scene in Picard was foretold in that TNG episode. I remember the Traveller being impressed with Wesley. What an amazing and surprising plot point that brings that character full circle and gives a proper closing to the Wesley character.Maybe a little more predictable is the name of a project seen on a file folder near the end of the last episode even if it is is also a strong link to the ST universe we know.THE ENDING, The actual ending is emotional and one that you are hoping for throughout the season. If we never saw Picard again then we could leave the TNG universe and Jean Luc Picard knowing it has come to a solid conclusion.There is to be a season 3 and I think the last season. It's well know that the most of the TNG cast are coming back. I wasn't please to hear this as I think we need to move on with new Trek. However if the writers could get me to like Q this season and give me a sense of peace for Picard then I'm willing to hope that season 3 will bring the whole TNG universe to a positive close. We never had any resolution after Nemesis so maybe season 3 of Picard will let us leave the TNG behind with good feelings.MOVIE? The ending of season 2 has a major development that really doesn't involve Picard and most of the people we know going forward. I hope Season 3 is a self-contained story arc that runs its course and is over. However the major development at the end of the season could easily lead into one or two movies with all new actors and ships. Such great potential and credit has to go to the writers of that ending. Sadly I don't think they'll go that route as I think they plan to saddle us with another Kelvin timeline movie from JJ Abrams. Too bad as there is so much potential in the storyline that it will be lost if it becomes part of season 3 of Picard when we will lose so much in telling the stories of all the TNG crew.SUMMARY. Season 1 is hit and miss. Season 2 is much better. Many people liked Allison Pill in season 2 but I didn't feel she was the right actress for the role. . I thought the break out actor in season 2 was Orla Bradly. If you are a TNG fan then watch the series to get to the last episode where you'll get some closer on some TNG elements. I never knew what they called it 10 Forward.","rating":"8\/10","date":"8 June 2022"}

{"title":"It IS still Star Trek, and it's very high quality","review":"As a fan of Star Trek since 1966, I have been mystified at all the hate being thrown at the Picard series. It is visually gorgeous, has complex layers of plot and characterization, and is backed by beautiful music created by one of the best composers working in TV and movies today.\"It's not Star Trek,\" they say. Yet every Star Trek series had its own look and feel and its own emphasis. Why complain that a new series does too?After thinking about this a bit, it occurred to me that the problem is that people don't like change in general. They want to hang on to something they loved in the past, and they want more of the same. Unfortunately, the reality of life-- and art-- is that things change and develop. As they should. There is tremendous creativity going on in the Star Trek universe, and that means there will be new and different ways of presenting stories. One might not like this or that detail, but overall the constant effort to create something wonderful that has never existed before, while honoring the past, deserves admiration.I wonder, if new stories and characters were put in front of those who hate recent versions of Star Trek that did nothing but rehash the old ones, if they would complain about that too.Star Trek is still telling stories that have immediate social significance. It's not fluff. It's darker than it used to be-- so is the world. But it is still about hope and about doing the right thing no matter how difficult or unpopular that may be. The fundamental Trek values have not gone away.The crucial thing about the Picard series, to me, is the exploration of what a man does with the time he has left when he knows the end of his life is bearing down on him. Picard is still absolutely Picard, and those who say he is not never really paid attention to TNG. Great man that he is, Picard has a streak of arrogance that has led to his undoing. (Melinda Snodgrass wrote in \"The Measure of a Man\" that he was a pompous, and we do see that aspect of his personality get him into trouble at times.) Yet he is still every inch the hero we need him to be.And the exploration of Romulan culture is great fun.For those who dismiss all this with terms like \"garbage\" and \"in the toilet,\" of course you are all entitled to your opinions. But please, let's see what stories you have written, what costumes you have designed, what characters you have brought to life in your own productions, since you obviously know how it should be done.","rating":"9\/10","date":"21 February 2020"}

{"title":"Finally, A Trek Show with some substance","review":"First things first, the original Star Trek series had flawed characters, racism, hatred, casual sex, and was not a pure Utopian world. When Kirk and Spock came upon other civilizations that were jacked up they interfered. Kirk on more than one occasion gave a speech on how societies need to fight and struggle through their problems and learn to grow, ideally together. The Next Generation crew were a little more hands off, but still racism and hate existed, sex was still a major player (even with an Android) and things were far from perfect though they sure tried to make it that way.\nRoddenberry realized that the world is far from perfect. He wanted a world without racism and senseless violence, but there was always violence in Star Trek. Along comes Picard after so many other shows showed promise and the world, the universe has advanced to a more realistic, not-quite-dystopian existence. The Romulans are still untrustworthy. The Borg have been conquered, but still elicit fear in some. Things went terribly wrong in the last 14 years and we zoom in on Picard and he's unhappy with it all. He's unhappy with the recent past, unhappy with the present and not so sure he's going to be happy with the possible futures he sees. What is more real than that? On top of that, he's 79 and he's no longer the standard hero type. He needs others to help him be a hero. He can't assemble the old crew, so he picks up what he can. Yeah, Rios is a little like Han Solo, but maybe a little more complicated. Raffi isn't the stalwart officer she used to be. People are flawed. I love it. It's real. Yet, it's still the Star Trek universe.\nMake no mistake, Picard wants the Utopian society. He wants to set things right, but he knows it comes at a price. When Deep Space 9 came out, it was supposed to be darker and grittier and at times it was just laughable. Not until the later seasons did it get a little darker. Star Trek: Picard is saying you can't have the light without the dark. You can't have good without the bad. Things don't always get resolved in 45 minutes. Characters move on and chose paths that suit them (like 7 of 9).\nI was dubious about this show, but I think they pulled it off. I think they gave us a problematic world and a struggling, former hero who still wants to do the right thing. He wants to make the universe a better place, but he needs help. He stumbles along the way and makes mistakes (how terribly human), but he keeps getting back up and fighting. I'm loving this show. This is what I've been waiting for since the first series ended. It's not perfect. There's some bad dialogue and some stupid things that happen, but it's a fun ride and it keeps you guessing.","rating":"8\/10","date":"30 March 2020"}

{"title":"So much better than I expected \/ s1+2 = 7 stars, s3 = 9 stars","review":"And I hope it stays that way in s3. That's why I'm only giving this show 7 stars so far - I really cannot wait to see how it will end. (see update below)So far I'm excited. Of course there are minor letdowns here and there (too much violence and action for my taste, for example, a lot of unnecessary swearing in s1, the amount of new technology, Hugh getting killed off, yet another love interest for Picard) but in general I am in love with this show (new cast members included).Somehow \"Picard\" managed to find a voice of its own and continue the story of my favorite ST crew. Every character that returns, even for just the briefest of moments, has made me smile like a little kid. And the new ones we get to meet are just fabulous. Kestra has been my favorite so far, because she's fun and doesn't fit into a box. Similar things apply to the new regulars: I couldn't pick one I didn't appreciate. Their stories touched me as much as Picard's, from beginning to end. It's all so very well done.The only thing missing for me in s1 was TNG's trademark optimism, but s2 made up for that on a level I truly didn't expect. Thanks for that! It really took me right back and made me happy. What else could I possibly ask for from a show that's supposed to entertain me?Update s3:\nThis show just moved up a star for me (from a 7 to an 8). What a ride! Nostalgia bait it's called by some, but I disagree. Where's that kind of negativity coming from? If you loved TNG, Picard's final season is going to make you happy. Just lean back and enjoy it.Is it perfect? Probably not, but it's getting pretty close. The entire cast is back on board with added layers to their characters and backstories. It's not just Picard who gets to grow and shine. The ensemble is back together and the audience gets to laugh and cry. So it actually feels like a love letter to fans and crew alike. Beautifully done, from beginning to end. After 10 weeks of weekly episodes, I'm only now able to catch my breath again. What has remained (from the finale especially) is a big smile, the kind the original show used to trigger back in the day. And I wouldn't mind if it lasted for a long long time.PS: Now bring on ST: Legacy, if you please, cameos included. Now that would sure keep that fangirly smile glued to my face.","rating":"8\/10","date":"9 January 2023"}

At this point, I have it on as background noise on the off-chance something of importance might happen... When I think back to the really good TNG episodes (or VOY episodes, for that matter) - this is light years behind.

{"title":"Great story, Disappointing presentation","review":"Loved the story, and the acting was great. Even in the first episodes of TNG the acting was not as good, but the parts were new to the actors then and they settled into them later.The presentation though was still the artsy fartsy crap that all the recent Star Treks have inflicted on the audience. Shaky Cam, Dark picture (so dark in fact that you couldn't see the color of the uniforms.) It shouldn't be \"work\" to watch a movie or TV show. What is a top-notch story is degraded by the bad presentation. I swear they stay awake at night dreaming up ways to piss off the audience. This is the type of thing that was used in the 70's to hide what they were unable to present due to limitations in technology and budget. They are no longer an issue here. This is just a couple of people with bad ideas of how to present entertainment. Brightness was my biggest issue in this series, then the smoky rooms when there wasn't supposed to be smoke. They shone brilliant lights at the camera silhouetting the actors. There is a use for this stuff but not throughout the entire season. Lens flare generators should all be destroyed and the manual on how to build them as well.Now off the soap box to the story. I thought it was one of the best story lines Star Trek has ever had. I am amazed at the resilience of Patrick Stewart. The man is 82 years old at the time he made the last season. His voice occasionally falters due to his age but doesn't detract from the story or his performance. (The same was true with Michael Dorn.) The nostalgia of bringing many of the original cast back was excellent. The new people were a profound complement to the show, and they fit in perfectly. The writers clearly dug into the original material from all the next generation material as I thought they represented it well.If Strange New Worlds can keep the quality and the connection to the original Trek, I think it will do very well. It's off to a good start. It is a shame that Picard is over, but it went out on a very high note with a satisfying ending.Well done to the Story people and the special effects of the show. Turn the lights up, get an exhaust fan and bolt down the cameras and you will get a perfect 10 next time.PeeDee.","rating":"8\/10","date":"28 April 2023"}
{"title":"\"The Best Generation\" (but skip Season 2)","review":"Having just watched the final episode of Season 3, I can say, overall that Picard was a wonderful conclusion to the career of Jean Luc.Season 1 (9\/10) had many detractors, but personally I loved it.Season 2 (5\/10) ... what the hell happened? Bad writing, corny lines, woke themes... did the millenials suddenly take over? After this debacle, my hopes for the next season were low, but...Season 3 (10\/10) - WOW! It took a few episodes to get going, but by the time Ep 5 came around, things just came together, and the last 3 episodes in particular stand out as some of the best in all of the Star Trek series. Yes, there was lots of nostalgia, but it was handled with care and respect by the directors and writers. The Finale was a perfect tribute to ST:TNG, tying in all the themes and characters of yesteryear beautifully. It was fair emotional!So overall, an 8\/10, let down by Season 2. But 1 and 3 just superb.This from an old-timer who watched Capt Jean Luc on our screens 1987-94.You will be missed!","rating":"8\/10","date":"21 April 2023"}
{"title":"(Not) Boldly Going","review":"I love the Star Trek franchise. I grew up with these shows. I'm still not totally on board with the revivals. (Not a Paramount subscriber so I haven't seen latest season of Discovery or SNW) Picard had so much potential, with or without the TNG cast reprising their roles.For me, Picard suffers from a lack of wonder. Star Trek has always been a philosophical adventure series. Season 2 especially seemed to forget that-instead trying to make a season out of Picard's family issues (That doesn't even make use of his brother).That brings me to the other issue I have. I cannot believe this show added the f-word to Star Trek. Seriously? Not necessary.Looking forward to the final season when hopefully the show gets back to its roots!","rating":"8\/10","date":"13 November 2022"}
{"title":"I Like Season 3 The Best","review":"Picard is a darker (literally), gorgeous production. The graphics are well done without being over the top. The cinematography is beautiful and the sets and costumes are well designed.The serial-driven stories, rather than episodic, was a change that worked well. While I liked the new characters (some more than others) I really showed up for the familiar faces: Picard, Seven, Data\/Soong-ancestors, and the small cameos of original cast members.I didn't mind the spicier language of the series. It was, honestly, more realistic. The action was consistently great, there was no gratuitous nudity or gore, just a loving embrace of sci-fi goodness.I did not think S1 and S2 were awful, but like most reviewers I believe Season 3 is what Picard should have been all along. I did like S1 better than S2. But S2 stands out simply because it was so antithetical to TNG. While I thought the time traveling in S2 started out as a nice homage to some of the period episodes of the original show, it just went on too long, sometimes veering into ridiculous. Everyone broke the one rule (blend in without getting caught) from the get-go yet everyone escaped with relative ease. (I have to say the FBI plotline was so far-fetched I kept waiting for a teeny tiny X Files reference just for an inside joke. But alas, opportunity missed.)But Season 3? Outstanding. Most of that is having the original characters back as well as giving some of the most memorable original guest actors some great cameos (or at least honorable mentions). The story lines were truer to the original series, and we have been gifted one of the most unlikeable, annoying, frustrating, kooky villains to grace the series: Captain Vadic portrayed with obvious relish by Amanda Plummer. She gave Q's John de Lancy a run for his money with delicious delivery.I wish they had brought the original cast in sooner. Maybe they thought the original cast was too old to carry three seasons? I think, with some quite humorous quips about their ages through all the seasons, that S3 proved these older actors can solidly carry an action show.It's worth noting that in Patrick Stewart's autobiography he talks about if Picard had changed in 20+ years, it would stand to reason the other characters would as well. Therefore the nuanced (or sometimes blatant) shifts in their characters added freshness and realism.","rating":"8\/10","date":"15 May 2024"}

Season 3 is largely not associated with the first two seasons so I'd skip the first two seasons if you are inclined to do so.Star Trek Strange New Worlds is great too.

So Picard would save his son, over the 500 people?Forget this massive OOPS, and the rest is very good\nWolf has turned into Spock\nRiker has turned into Bones to upset Wolf,\nand as we know Picard always admired Kirk, well now he has turned into him.And that is what makes it so good, with Jack (the Brit) and Captain Liam Shaw for me the best ones.This really is a Throw in everything on the Next Gen and a bit of Voyager mix it up and this time you have a beautiful dinner\nI watched the 1st episode and was \"interested\" I watched the 2nd and was hooked, and then in Episode 6 I nearly cried, Kirk's Enterprise, was a thing of Beauty. Then using the Bird Of Prey, the beautiful little bows to TOS. I think Mr Shatner will love that.The story also works so well, mind you the Vadic character, Nope, not for me, talk about over-acting, ruins the whole show. And is she meant to look like Adolf Hitler without the tash.By Episode 8 the dinner was eaten, and now the dessert which is rather sickly Vadic looking, and where did Wolf go? Oh wait Spock is back \u00f0\u0178\u02dc\u0160\nData rocks, and the music is from the films and Next Gen. And a lot of the star-ship sounds are from TOS\nEpisode 9 I sort of guessed as there was a few clues, Shaw mentioning it, and then when we saw the body I guessed it, as everything from Next Gen had been thrown in, they had to throw the Borg in. And Jack was his son, and had special powers. And the Queen is back and a old Friend!The Final Frontier, I mean the Final Episode\nFor me, ok so many series have great leading up to the final episode, and this is another one. The ending was not as good as the episodes that come before it. And we get a sloppy ending. But what has happened to Beverley Crusher's face, looks very plastic\nIt was good, very good, but now it's the end, and let it end this way. But I have a feeling that there is yet another series waiting to be written, and if so Jack and 7of9 might just work?

It's great to see his want for one last adventure. We meet interesting, new characters along with a sweet ship. There's enough familiarity with Romulans and Borg backdrops, but it's most unique with android plot line.Season 2- 5\/10\nWho would want to spend time in present day LA when we could be flying among the stars? The season is a mess. First two episodes start strong with a dystopian future, advanced Borg attack, and a visit from Q. Then, we spend nearly the rest of the season with a device we've seen too much of in Star Trek: What if we put the heroes in present day? The side plot on immigrants is heavy handed and characters being chased by cops is boring. Overall, they add more villains without knowing what to do with the current cast that all had greater purposes last season.Season 3- 10\/10\nWho would like to see the original cast back together one more time? Ding ding ding. They finally hit it right. The reunion isn't rushed either as they allow some mystery to build around the new threat. The payoff of the last two episodes are great. We feel scared for the end of Starfleet, humored by the character quips, and deeply moved by the nostalgia it brings.","rating":"8\/10","date":"23 April 2023"}

But through the bridge to the previous Picard seasons, which only kept me weakly to the pole, this version led to a credible (as far as possible in the Scify) and exciting finale at the end of which one or the other trekker was probably dreaming a new edition or maybe a sequel with slightly different faces.It was nice to see the faces of the old squadrons emerge from the fog of memory and take new people with them.

It looks like series 4 will focus on the children of the next generation crew. I have been a avid star trek fan for 40 years and finally it seems we are getting the old star trek back. If you are a fan and have given up after discovery, I urge you to watch Picard from the begining you are in for a treat.

Jack is a former adventurer who has spent most of his life traveling the galaxy, seeking thrills and excitement. However, he has finally decided to take his life and career seriously and has joined Starfleet to make a difference.The crew encounters a number of challenges and mysteries on their journey, including encounters with hostile alien races, natural disasters, and unexplained phenomena. Along the way, they learn more about each other and form a close-knit bond.However, the biggest challenge for the crew comes when they discover evidence of a sinister plot by a shadowy organization that threatens to destabilize the entire galaxy. As they work to uncover the truth and stop the plot, Seven, Raffi, and Jack must confront their own personal demons and make difficult choices that will determine the fate of the galaxy.Throughout the series, we see Seven of Nine grappling with the responsibilities of command, relying on her experience as a former Borg drone and her sense of duty to guide her decisions. Raffi serves as Seven's trusted advisor, using her street-smarts and unconventional thinking to help the crew overcome obstacles. Jack brings a sense of adventure to the crew, but also proves himself to be a capable and dedicated officer.Overall, the series would explore themes of growth, redemption, and sacrifice, while also providing plenty of action, adventure, and exploration.","rating":"8\/10","date":"6 May 2023"}
{"title":"If Vulcans are stiff plastic blow up dolls, Romulans are the real deal...","review":"The story was great, the production value awesome, the cast and acting talent is fantastic. Picard is the stories of what happens after a sucessful movie or tv show you always dreamed about and fantasize in your head after your favorite show ended. It does not disappoint. The season touches upon the age long discussion of what defines being alive, whether it's organic or non-organic, AI being true intelligence or not, just how far our acceptance of those who are different from us really goes. Its very good, the second season is a start of something good too, reminds me of star trek 4. Yes really recommend seeing this series, won't give too much details as I don't want to ruin it for you so give it a try. Peyton List as the Romulan commander is extremely sexy and good looking for a pointy eared Romulan. She's the best eye candy hands down in this series, if only to watch her, it makes this series worth seeing.

{"title":"To boredly go where no one has bored before..","review":"I guess most people are looking at the reviews trying to gauge whether they should watch this show based on other trekkies' opinions.\nPersonally I love TNG and Picard, also DS9, voyager too, and the new Discovery.\nI really don't wanna drag this show down because it is not to my taste, but it's a bit like the Han Solo film.. people like the character, but that's not a good enough excuse to build a quirky story around it for the sake of another show. And that's what I can't put my finger on.. What does this show want to be? It's not TNG at all just cameoing characters desperately from it. Picard - while he has been vulnerable in the TNG shows on certain levels, he just feels useless and completely stripped of his \"in command\" image with the Enterprise and Starfleet behind him. This is deliberate I guess, but I wish they would let some of his character's cunning shine. He is just going along with events asking people to trust him.\nIt's also part Firefly\/Cowboy Bebob ragtag spaceship adventure. And part espionage, and part action. But for me, unfortunately, it is mostly boring. I've fallen asleep during this show more than after a hefty holiday turkey dinner. I've just watched episode 8. I might wait til the series end and try to watch the rest at once, it is not keeping any week to week interest for me.\nDiscovery had it's slow parts as well, but it was fresh, new, and most importantly: we had no expectations from it because the main characters were new to TV.\nReading the reviews here, I think most of us were expecting something different. The show's content could be fine, but the presentation and pacing are god awful.\nCompanion characters are also nothing spectacular, and then they went and cloned 2 or however many extra ones of the pilot with the emergency holograms. Please... multiply the boredom of that character even more.\nBut what for me is truly THE worst: that romulan spy guy with haircut. Good lord WHY? For the sake of all that is star trek could they not keep stupid current trends out of this futuristic show?","rating":"4\/10","date":"15 March 2020"}

{"title":"This is not Star Trek","review":"Picard, much like Discovery, is not Star Trek. Far from it. It is a self indulgent show produced to churn money by leveraging the great ethos of the series, while delivering none of the hope, the joy, the music, the stories, and the characters.For starters, you cannot watch Picard with your kids, because it is rated MA - I cannot remember a Star Trek series ever having that rating. Then we have the story lines that are inept, sloppy and just not engaging, to put it charitably. The characters are totally not believable - you have \"doctors\" walking around who look like they just got their drivers license. Almost without exception, everyone in authority is a woman while men are depicted as mindless fruitcakes. You've got absolutely horrible camerawork, where each shot has to have a lens flare, and each shot is over someone's shoulder or head - taking up a quarter of the screen (terribly distracting). You have dialogue that seems to have no thought - just flippant banter that does not evoke the sense that you are dealing with mature or intelligent people.Finally, there is Picard himself, a frail shell of the man he once was - his voice weak and quivering, unsurprisingly unfortunately, and he does not inspire any feeling when you look at him - just sadness that he allowed his legacy to be co-opted by this band of social justice warriors.This is not Star Trek. Period.","rating":"2\/10","date":"8 February 2020"}

It started to become awesome.There where real stakes, interesting character development. Fan service done right and by the end I was crying tears of joy, as a die hard Trekkie I got to see my friends again.No just in name, the characters I love where there. Picard as a character has been pretty much destroyedbby season 1 and 2 but they still managed to give him a little bit of respect back.The last few episodes where truly epic, the music, editing, direction and visuals are so damn good. It's far from TNG in tone and pretty much the whole show is set in darkness, but I feel and hope that the future of Trek is as bright as the final send off for the crew of the Enterprise D, that this season was.Skip season 1,2 like the plague.","rating":"3\/10","date":"30 April 2023"}

{"title":"Not the Trek I grew up with","review":"I do find myself still watching this show in anticipation of something familiar to me. On the surface there is some, but the underlying's are far more dark and crude. In all honesty, this reminds me of the Battlestar Gallactica remake where writers\/directors\/producers felt the need to try and be ground breaking to the series.Unfortunately I think Gene Roddenberry would very much disapprove of this new direction the show has taken. From episode one, we get the introduction to vulgarity (I can recall when Captain Kirk said \"Hell\" in the 60's and it was a big deal...how things have changed). Then of course the sex is introduced, and then the violence and gore. Pretty mind blowing, and a lack of real writing to make things entertaining without all the adolescent BS.I'm pretty disappointed in Patrick Stewart thinking all of this was needed to make a quality continuation of Star Trek. Much of this junk leaves out the younger audience, an audience that Star Trek and subsequent Roddenberry series were able to capture both young and older audiences. Wow. I hope reviews like this are read and taken to heart. Maybe season 2 can be cleaned up some and back on track with what the Star Trek Universe is about.Update 5\/1\/2022. Season 2 is here. More disappointments. More Hollywood conditioning that ICE and Border Patrol in the USA are evil and treat ALL migrants with cruelty. Then in a later episode, you have more references about how corrupt law enforcement is in our century.I'm really trying to give this show a chance, but it really is hard to digest with all the modern day woke mentality it spews.Maybe Strange New Worlds will be better...we can only hope.","rating":"2\/10","date":"22 February 2020"}

{"title":"Do not watch Season 2, the awful writing will have you disliking Star Trek","review":"Season 2 is god-awful thanks to the terrible writing of Akiva Goldsman.It's more or less about an 80 year old man going through therapy to deal with things that happened when he was.. 12 years old. So that he can be \"free\" to live out his remaining years to do exactly what he was doing before.There is a secondary story of him and his horribly written band of idiots trying to save the universe. But they constantly seem to forget that they're trying to save the universe, could easily mess it up, and get distracted by every passing squirrel.But you see all of this is ok because it was meant to happen. All of these people and villains were meant to be stupid.Raffi Musiker is definitely one of the worst Star Trek characters ever written.Skip this if you like Star Trek at all, or risk having a lessened opinion of Star Trek as a whole.","rating":"3\/10","date":"14 May 2022"}

How could he buy I to this rubbish. The story, acting, characters, narrative goes against everything Star Trek is and yet he seemingly accepts it and goes along.

Hollywood simply does not pay writers to be creative any more. They pay them to make money.

{"title":"STAR TREK BECOMES STAR WARS","review":"The original view of Gene Roddenberry was to display a functioning Utopia in the form of the United Federation of Planets. With infinite free energy and replicators, money and the stratification of society were a thing of the past. The pursuit of the mind was the worthy goal of the various federated races. That dream is now dead. With such cliche's as finding and hiring a captain and ship, visiting slum worlds, drug and alcohol abuse, filthy language and more, we find ourselves in a universe far closer to the Star Wars series than the Star Trek you knew and loved.If you, like me, viewed Captain Jean Luc Picard as a surrogate father figure, get ready to view him as a doddering old fool with very few lines. Everywhere he goes he is ridiculed and disrespected. And like a good whipped dog, he simply bows his head and takes it. After all he did in his illustrious career he has no friends, no allies but the tired old cliche of a ragtag hired crew which still doesn't respect him in any way - only his money. The once potent Picard has been relegated to playing (barely) a poor second string. This series could have and should have been so much more. It certainly isn't due to a lack of talent in Patrick Stewart. No, but as with the Star Trek with Michelle Burnham, in the new 'woke' world of Star Trek: Picard, Strong Female Leads (tough guys) abound while the powerful, calm and compassionate white male leadership of TNG has been put firmly and irretrievably 'in its place' - the past.If you loved the character of Captain Jean Luc Picard, take my advice, don't sully your memory of him with this dreck.","rating":"4\/10","date":"19 April 2020"}
{"title":"Very disappointing for this Star Trek TNG fan","review":"I was\/am a big fan of Star Trek TNG, especially Patrick Stewart. It was because of this show, Star Trek: Picard, that I subscribed to CBS All Access. (I debated, because we were already paying a lot to watch the shows we enjoyed.) Anyway, I was excited to see Patrick Stewart reprise his role as Jean-Luc Picard. Unfortunately, I have been very disappointed in the series so far. (I have watched 8 episodes.) Here's my list of complaints:* The shows are painfully slow.* Picard's character is a downer, very different from the captain we knew and loved from TNG. (Yes, the situation is grim, but he is not the same Picard as before.)* The series must be watched in sequence. You cannot just tune in an episode and watch like in TNG. You would be completely lost.* The series is full of bad language (as in cussing). I personally say \"bad\" words now and then, but they aren't necessary in Star Trek, especially the \"F\" word. To me, it seems the swearing is added in an attempt to sound \"cool,\" and it just seems forced and out of place.* Some of the gore is not necessary. It used to be if there was something bad happening, they wouldn't show it. Now they go so far as to show someone's eye being popped out without anesthesia, among other things. Really? Yuck and no thank you.* I repeat, the shows are painfully slow.The one thing I have enjoyed is seeing some old \"friends\" again, if only for a short time, including Data, Seven of Nine, Riker and others. I will watch the remainder of this season. However, if something doesn't drastically change in the next couple of episodes, I will cancel my CBS All Access subscription and give up on this series. Too bad, because I had high hopes. After all this time, I expected something MUCH better.**************\nUpdate after watching the last 2 episodes: The felt the 2-part season finale was good. However, it was slow going to get there. Although it was nice to see Picard and others from previous Star Trek series of the past, I much prefer the older series (TNG and Voyager especially) and will stick with watching them instead of continuing with Picard. My overall rating of this series remains a 4.","rating":"4\/10","date":"16 March 2020"}
{"title":"It doesn't have the spirit of TNG","review":"The current 7.7 rating is from rating manipulation. Picard (2020) is a second-rate imitation of the Star Trek universe.Characters in TNG had an almost Shakespearean disposition, especially Captain Picard. It gave the viewer an impression of a future where humanity was... different. Perhaps more refined. In Picard (2020) everyone acts like a stereotypical 21st century person. What a bleak vision of the future.The plot barely makes sense. Even when it does make sense it is derivative and poorly executed. It is a clumsy rehash of the major themes from Blade Runner.","rating":"1\/10","date":"26 April 2020"}
{"title":"How can ANYONE who understands what Star Trek is, like this series? It's NOT Star Trek at all!","review":"The federation with it's core values, principals, morality and desire to help and stand by your comrades, friends and fellow Star fleet officers... Is ALL GONE!I stopped watching after episode five and it's been a struggle to get this far. The only reason I'm continuing to watch is because seven of nine just appeared and I have to say Jeri Ryan only gets better looking with age. She looks absolutely fantastic and after 20 years has barely aged a day even though her character's look is rather gritty compared to her former appearance, but she's still beautiful and sexy.She's about the best thing I can say so far about this series. I don't understand how such A HORRIBLE series could actually be made but as a serious Star wars fan and strong Star Trek fan, I'm noticing a bizarre pattern here. It's as though these studios and directors are purposely going Out of their way to destroy these beloved franchises!you have JJ Abrams who comes in and remakes Star Trek back in 2009 that completely changes the size and of course the entire galaxy by using the age-old retarded time travel trick because all these directors really care about is making their own mark on something and they have no concern whether it's good or bad. They simply want to make something their own that they don't give a dam about what the fans want or care about nor what any other director has done before, nor about keeping any kind of continuity. It's all about leaving their own mark on something regardless of the backlash.Then you have Disney buying Star wars from Lucas and again JJ Abrams takes the helm for the force awakens which is soon as I heard that he was directing I KNEW he was going to do the same thing here did to Star Trek and he's going to completely alter the feel, the science, the characters and the way the entire universe works.. And he did.Then you have Ryan Johnson who comes in and COMPLETELY Nukes everything that was Star Wars by killing Luke, Ackbar, and all the other God AWFUL things he did in that movie, then Abrams along with the completely incompetent Kathleen Kennedy comes back and puts the nails in the coffin that was the most beloved and profitable movie franchise in history in just a few years.Now we have Star Trek Discovery and Picard and ONCE AGAIN the pattern repeats itself and they have COMPLETELY altered and destroyed everything that was Star Trek. EVERYTHING is completely different from the entire universe Galaxy itself, the way the ships and technology looks and works, the special effects though impressive LOOKING are somehow devoid of any real feel or depth. It's as though the entire show is one big hologram. Even the Borg cube is completely different.. And that stupid scene where the guy and girl are sliding down the metal deck in their socks... What are they 4 years old? How stupid and ridiculous!I'm shocked that Johnathan Frakes is directing this but just like Abrams destroying Star Trek and Star Wars with Kennedy, these writers and directories are now doing the EXACT same thing to Picard!Something must be going on because there is DEFINITELY a pattern here. Hollywood just plain sucks and this is why Sean Connery when asked why he doesn't act anymore said that it's because there is no one in Hollywood who knows how to make movies anymore and the directors are just terrible.It seems that anything that once gave people hope and joy and the promise of a better tomorrow is being systematically destroyed on purpose. It can't be coincidental that all these series are being changed Soo much from they're original successful formats that worked for DECADES as it's almost inconceivable that nearly every writer, director, creative consultant etc could actually be this incompetent, out of touch with the plethora of source material they have, and so unable to follow the successful formats unless it's being done on purpose for some reason.Picard is only a shell of his former self and ass with every other TV show and movie made today, the ONLY thing that seems to matter is pushing their endless SJW agendas, having ridiculously and unrealistic alpha Female characters galore and almost all beta males. You can CLEARLY SEE the feminist influence in this as it's all about forcing down the patriarchy of the white male represented by Picard's character and having the women be the leaders, thinkers, problem solvers and always out fighting, out thinking the males. Even in TNG almost every admiral was female or the head of every major division was a woman.

{"title":"PRODUCERS: Get Back to ST Basics","review":"This is kind of like purchasing a Ferrari and lifting the hood only to find a Hyundai engine. The original STAR TREK tackled political and hot button social issues like race, fascism, etc.with integrity. It was in a true sense a series of morality plays. It wasn't STAR WARS. It's definitely not GAME OF THRONES. If this series fails, it will do so because it abandons the parameters set out in Gene Roddenberry's original series' \"Bible,\" which was the size of an L.A. phone book. (Yes, I've seen a copy.) Roddenberry demanded that the outcome always end positively. It was never dark, apocalyptic or sadistic. He saw the future in the best possible light and anyone who threatened to derail it was the enemy, i.e. a \"strongman\" or dictator like KHAN. Most of the franchise adhered to these guidelines and were hugely successful. If PICARD fails, it will because it fails to be true to the franchise Bible, which is Roddenberry's written vision for STAR TREK. I suggest the producers abandon the cable playbook (\"all of the story you can squeeze between unlimited sex, violence and sadistic cruelty\") return to what works for this franchise and more importantly, it's audience.","rating":"3\/10","date":"15 March 2020"}

The Star Trek of the late 20th century - next generation, deep space nine, voyager - the Star Trek that fans actually want - is dead.

{"title":"If you Make Real Star Trek They will come","review":"Once again the creators are trying real hard to lure viewers through unnecessary intimate scenes, violence and foul language. That's not Star Trek.Picard is no longer the relational and highly intelligent Start Fleet Captain. I accept that; as he is older now. However, the rest of Star Fleet and Federation has devolved into barbarism all throughout.For instance, a highly compassionate scientist who is also a member of the Federation, murders another fellow scientist. Then in Broken Pieces this same murderer is allowed to roam around the ship freely without anyone being concerned about her mental state. Neither Captain Rios, nor Jean-Luc suggest that perhaps she should be put in the brig. These sequences of events completely defy what makes Star Trek so humane, compassionate and righteous.Give us the humanity, compassion and intelligence of Start Trek! Do away with archaic violence and profanity and watch fans flock in numbers!","rating":"1\/10","date":"15 March 2020"}

{"title":"Not The Picard I Remember...","review":"Now that the season has wrapped up and I've finished it, time for a review...Picard started off strong.In the first episode.From there, it was downhill. I'm not going to get into how this doesn't feel like Star Trek or get into a twist about F'bombs being dropped into the show (which never bothered me) or how some characters have very thick accents that don't suit them.All of that doesn't really matter. What matters is the writing, the story and whether or not Picard is truly 'our' Picard that we remember from the show.Well, no, he isn't. He's aged, but not like a fine wine. And that's the problem; part of it is Patrick Stewart's performance, which isn't bad, but it certainly doesn't scream Picard. It's as if he's playing another character entirely, or himself!However, most of the blame goes to the writing and the supporting cast. Good god its awful. And it gets worse as the season goes on. The writing is shockingly simplistic and linear with no depth, no substance; no character.Characters feel like they've been ripped out of cliche tropes we've seen time and time again. Examining the credits of the writers, its apparent that a lot of them worked on Discovery.I liked Discovery. It was flawed, and had its moments of increasingly bad writing, but the grittyness of it and a strong cast (not talking about Burnham) saved it for me.Which surprises me to see how wrong they got it for Picard. I can't really go into how they really ham-fisted in some character romances without going into spoiler territory. Really really forced it in there and it made no sense.Plot was drivel and uninteresting. Decent premise ruined by cliche sci-fi tropes we have seen before that really did not need to be touched upon for what should have been a sensitive yet thrilling experience in Picard's last voyage.Patrick Stewart wanted to draw inspiration from Logan when he signed up for this.I'm sorry to say, as much as I loved Logan, there is none of that in here. It has none of Logan's gritty charm and rather than being influenced by it, the writers took their modern sensibilities and crammed it into Picard.And that is why I am not looking forward to Season 2. I'll check it out for sure. Sadly, I am not excited by it.","rating":"2\/10","date":"31 March 2020"}

{"title":"Very Dissapointed","review":"Im a massive fan of TNG, grew up with it so as expected I was really looking forward to this show. After watching it I kinda wish I didn't. It has many faults.Biggest problem for me was the bad language, the FBombs. What were the show runners thinking putting this in the show. It's not Star Trek. Calling Picard 'JL'. Everytime she called him that made me so angry. The real Picard would have never put up with that. It copies The Expanse too much in its style, dark nature and setup, not that that's a bad thing as the Expanse is a great show. It again just isn't Star Trek. Picard is out of character sometimes. He would never tolerated JL and the bad language thrown at him. One of the things that's plaguing a lot of shows and computer games is political gender. It creeps into this show in spades. Too many female leads, the feminists got hold of this one. Also there's the racial politics. Why suddenly do we have black and asian romulans with natural skin tone colours and beards. I thought the romulans in TNG had a greenish pale tinge to their makeup with black hair and a pointy fringe.\nPotholes galore. Where did Soong decide to have a son. Think back to the episode Datalore. He mentions Data and Lore being his only sons. The series as a whole was very poorly written and executed and made to compete with Marvel to look cool for the teenagers. The ending I'm not even gonna go there just to say it was terrible. The worst ending of a series I've ever seen on a TV screen.Now what I liked was Episode 7. Nostalgia kicked in on a very emotional level for me with this episode. The director nailed it and it was perfect. But that was the only good episode other than the 'yeah that was ok' pilot. Picard's dreams of data, yes a nice touch but was he really that attached to him in TNG. If I remember it was only First Contact you saw Picard connected strongly to Data in the way it is in this series but that was only because he got captured by the Borg. Picard would have done the same for any of his crew.Such a shame and wasted show for me. I have no interest in seeing the second season unfortunately.","rating":"4\/10","date":"2 April 2020"}

{"title":"Harvey Dent was Right....","review":"If you are a writer, I think its important to approach a new Star Trek series with an understanding of what made the show a decades long success. It created a sense of adventure, inspired us to be better than we are, and gave us hope that a bright and peaceful future was possible.This was well established in ST:TNG, where the Gene Roddenberry's vision of the future was fully realized. A powerful captain and electic crew that was galvanized by morality, passion, diversity, and common values. Clever plot devices, characters both strong and flawed playing off each other, and bold stories for the time it was in still resonate today. It was truly a hero for many of us and still is.ST:TNG was everything that \"Star Trek Picard\" is not. The flaws are easily seen in the first episode, where they simultaneously ignore (or dismiss) an established universe while tearing apart the moral foundation of the Federation. No pilot episode should have familiar fans scratching their heads during all of the world building.It was immediately confusing to me that the Romulan Star Empire did not have the resources to evacuate Romulus by themselves. It was well established over TNG and DS9 that the Romulans were the equal to the Federation. Many head scratches followed when the Federation was portrayed as a xenophobic and militant organization against Romulans and complicit with the destruction of their homeworld, the Federation is now an organisation not interested in saving other life. It has also become an organisation that has built a labour force out of androids, an idea that was effectively axed in the classic TNG episode \"measure of a man\".Picard himself is not the man I remember either. He was once a role model, a man who stood on principle, breaking the rules to do what is right, a skilled diplomat that taught us violence is not an answer, and a man who did what he could to stand for what he believed in. Now, we have a man who gave up, a man who, despite having saved the galaxy numerous times over a 40 year career, is now forgotten by history or downright ridiculed. It is mindboggling to me that such a well established and iconic character who embodied some of the best qualities to strive for is now treated as an annoying old man that should just \"mind is own business and stay out of the way\". (Also, hearing an admiral use the F word after his impassioned speech was quite cringy).I could go on about this show, but to summarize, it is quite obvious to me that Alex Kurtzman has either never watched Star Trek before, doesnt care about it, or is too afraid to create a show filled with hope. Regardless he now relies on cheap and nonsensical plot devices with flashy SFX and cliche angsty teen drama. Rather than being the bright and hopeful future that was TNG, we now have an embodiment of xenophobia and Trump's America that is now referred to as The Federation.The hero has now lived long enough to become the villain.","rating":"2\/10","date":"4 March 2020"}

Now just 4 episodes later it has happened, we have reached dumpster fire status. My mind is blown how this series continues to hold a 8.2 rating despite all of the low ratings now flooding in, seems a bit fishy to me. This show has almost no redeeming qualities, the pacing is all over the place, the story is weak, the plot goes against logic, and whoever thought it was a good idea to have a lens flare every 30 seconds should never be within 100 meters of a camera again. My eyes might have permanent retina damage after watching Episode 5, i don't think there was ever a 1 minute gap where we weren't subjected too blinding lights or lens flares. Nothing about this show is 'Star Trek', and they some how managed to decrease my interest with the introduction of Seven of Nine which is a feat in itself to have butchered a character and episode so badly. The best course of action at this point is to pretend this series never happened to preserve the good memory of are beloved Star Trek characters.","rating":"2\/10","date":"25 February 2020"}

He has no energy, is disrespected at Star Fleet and talked down to by the other characters, and accepts that behavior. In this universe, even some strange Will calls him 'arrogant' and tells him he is not up to the challenge. And weird Deanna tells him, 'You had it coming'. Horrible.To revisit Hugh, which is such a wonderful character, and kill him.Why couldn't we just enjoy revisiting the positive Star Trek world, our beloved characters and see their legacy honored, not destroyed?And is it lost on anyone that Hugh doesn't even mention Geordi?????Complete absurdity.","rating":"1\/10","date":"5 April 2020"}
{"title":"Star Trek: Gone Forever","review":"Reading through these reviews something very notable becomes apparent. Star Trek fans will clearly lay out their criticisms and the fundamental problems with yet another Kurtzman-ruined Star Trek parody, and then those who give 10 out of 10 attack the fanbase they were clearly never a part of, and their young age shows. \"it's not the 80's any more\" and such. Of course they completely fail to realise that Star Trek was still making brand new TV shows 2 years before Kurzman and Abrams got their hands on the franchise and rebooted it for no apparent reason whatsoever other than a cash grab.This is like one long boring drawn out episode that (when taking into account the montages of the last episode, the next episode, the title sequence and such) actually leaves about 36 minutes of watchable content. I say watchable loosely, as I am now only watching this with morbid curiosity, like slowing down to look at a car accident.The plot is predictable to the extreme, bears no resemblance to any version of Star Trek before 2009, has zero science (just writers making up Doctor Who type fantasy timey whimey gibberish with no grounding in science WHATSOEVER), seems to go out of it's way to destroy and retcon whatever of the Star Trek universe it can get it's hands on, has nothing even slightly positive or motivating, and worse of all it's ruining the legacy, just as Discovery did.Canon violations galore, no where even close to family viewing, miserable and dumbed down once again.This is Star Trek written by people who hate Star Trek for people who hate Star Trek's fundamentally positive and intellectually defined character. Decades of world building thrown out like an inconvenience. It's bland, formulaic writing with desperate needs for endless cliffhangers of characters and plot lines that aren't even interesting to mentally question where it's all supposed to be going.Welcome to Star Trek: Dystopia, where people ram their view of divisive politics down your throat, because let's face it if you voted Brexit or Trump then you're fundamentally wrong, bad, evil, and everything broken in the world is all your fault, because democracy is bad now, and the future is written by people who fail to give loser's consent after they've lost a vote on anything. What a petulant and exclusive mindset to write into a franchise as it's death rattle. I suspect much of this is Patrick Stewart's fault, and if the articles of his interviews are anything to go by, he's become a bitter old man completely unable to relate to either the Trek fanbase who (it now appears) idolised the wrong person all these years. Picard now just roams around waving his stick and shouting at clouds.Well done Kurtzman the disaster artist. You and Secret Hideout broke another franchise, it can never recover from this.

Well it started well.Then it just evolved into a slow, drawn-out cliched sci-fi show which has been seen many times before; becoming less 'Trekky' and much, much more generic.From the typical 'rag tag' crew (Tick) with their usual talents & haunts (Tick) to shoehorning in characters from 'TNG' (Tick) whose involvement didn't really aid the lack lustre story at all.The casting was as poor as was the character (and story) development and the conclusion felt more of a necessity to compensate for the time wasted and the hope for a second series.(Short) Update:S2:\nAfter realising S1 didn't work out too well they decided to rework the already overdone (Original, TNG, DS9) concept of time travel where they decided to land in 2024 - how over cooked, cheap and unoriginal.S3: 10% Story 90% Fan Service\nAnyone rating Season 3 is either doing it because it wasn't S1 or S2 or are happy with regurgitating a series based on homage and nostalgia and thinking it is 'good'.Once again rather than developing ideas they just rework them. The character Data (who Brent Spiner said he would never play again) returns as does the rest of the crew, the Enterprise D and they even manage to shoehorn in a section of: 'Guess the Ship' while they showcase all of the ships from the previous shows.The casting for the most part was necessary, Riker is showcased as being incredibly inept (in the episodes Frakes directs) and Ed Speelers acting is just woeful.The best thing about it, is that it has ended and probably made a few Trekkies happy.","rating":"5\/10","date":"4 April 2020"}

But for a story to be engaging it needs to be believable, and this one isn't. I might be wrong but I have a feeling this will not be the only such bad attempt at throwing buzzwords that sound \"sciency\" around and hoping they stick. I feel sorry for the producers and for the cast but the story is just terrible, next time hire a physicist as a consultant so it's a bit less embarrassing.","rating":"2\/10","date":"5 February 2020"}
{"title":"High hopes, idealism and optimism shattered","review":"I'm a big Star Trek fan and, in particular, of The Next Generation series. I had high expectations for Star Trek: Picard. Having Patrick Stewart and Jonathan Frakes in key roles boded well. They had breathed life into 7 seasons of TNG and must've been well connected to what made that show such a success.I've watched the first 5 episodes of Picard and I feel a bit shell-shocked by how much has changed.In TNG, and even DS9, Voyager and Enterprise, we have a hopeful future where humanity reaps the benefits of enlightened ethics and morality. Unfortunately Star Trek Picard takes a big step in the opposite direction, painting a picture of a dystopian Federation.Where previous incarnations of Star Trek were relatively family friendly with comparatively mild fight scenes, Picard lowers the tone with low-brow graphic gore and torture scenes. It's just so cheap, you don't need extreme graphic suffering to make a story enjoyable.The Picard universe has a very different look and feel, probably mostly due to gaudy CGI effects - you feel like you're watching Guardians of the Galaxy or Ghost in the Shell. It just feels trashy and inauthentic - it's not the Alpha and Beta quadrants you remember.If you're looking for another dose of the good stuff you loved from The Next Generation you're not going to find it in Picard. Some of the actors may be the same and you might encounter a few liberal lashings of obvious nostalgic references but the the good spirited, bright optimism of principles and integrity, of a future to look forward to has been eviscerated with cheaply bought thrills and garish CGI. Gone are the days when the story line mattered more than the special effects.My recommendation - re-watch The Next Generation and pretend that Picard never happened.","rating":"3\/10","date":"2 April 2020"}

STE was ok but not great. I like Scott Bakula but sheesh there were more aliens on the infant Starfleet crew in that show than in TOS. okay, that's forgivable.but sheesh why id Abrahamson feel it necessary to take his star wars movie and call it star trek?and why did cbs follow his lead and make discovery, occurring before TOS, seem like it was centuries AFTER tos in technology?this isn't quite so bad. compared to discovery, this is good.but its not Star Trek.as others have pointed out, Star Trek was, and these new sci-fi shows which are distainfully called star trek, are not :HopefulEgalitarian, without SHOUTING IN YOUR FACE THAT A (insert a -non white male- ) CAN BE POWERFUL.A story, with ups and downs. laughs and cries (new stuff is all cries)interesting and believable problem solvingALMOST NEVER Deus ex-machina. oh, wait, I understands jj abramomma doesn't know what that means. hmm. neither does CBStechnology was good enough that once you suspend your disbelief, it fits in as if it were actually real. never astonishinggreat character buildingMUTED special effects. rare combat scenes (I love space combat, and the rare combat in ST - but this new stuff is just star wars.and the most obvious - Star Trek is EPISODIC !

It seems like they've put all their effort into making every scene so epic with its colours and music thinking that silence would be too boring and that they've forgotten to focus on the real meaning of the story or of Star Trek. And I'm so done with this forced feminism on TV series. Please stop.

The federation is suddenly xenophobic? Done so the liberal writer (#notmypresident) can feel at home. Star Trek, another franchise sacrificed on the altars of woke and TDS.I've stopped watching the casino planet episode, 5 I think. 3 Stars is generous and my rating isn't lower to show that this isn't as bad as STD, but that's the only positive thing I can say about this trainwreck.Star Trek is dead, just as Star Wars.

It is the end of hope.\nI have just one suggestion for the creators and writers: try to imagine the time and effort (especially for non english language people) to take the time and effort to write a review to express their disappointment.

{"title":"Not a Star Trek","review":"What is a \"Star Trek\"? It was a show that displayed Earth community (and later Star Federation's community) that was reborn after devastating times of its history. Original Series, early seasons of TNG, it was all 60-70's bright future, new races and civilizations, new life, different that our owns, better, evolved in all ways. Then we had late TNG, DS9, Voyager, that was different, but still had something of original idea. And since i enjoyed Enterprise, i still feel that Star Trek went far away from the idea. Current media can't repeat early success, so they are trying to sell us an emotion, inviting old actors into the series, but they are missing an old idea. Star Trek Picard full of modern \"idea\". \"Go girls\", \"gender equality\", \"social drama\" This themes aren't new, we had strong women characters before, like Ripley, G.I. Jane, Sarah Connor, e.t.c They were persons who made themselves, who was better not by the fact that they are women, but by the fact, they can do better than rest of the cast. This series is full of stereotypes. We have \"trouble girl\", \"wise girl\", \"danger girl\", \"carrying girl\", \"sexy boy\", \"roudy boy\", \"wise grandpa\" and ofcourse, since US is struggling with migrants problem we have non white characters, just because they have to be, not because plot will have something from them being \"not white\". This is not a series about story, this is a series about modern stereotypes and how they coexist. This is a series in a universe, we all came to love, about the problems of the modern society of a USA and some of the EU countries, and that is a major problem. I'am not sure, that i can withstand the rest of the season, all its achieved, is that i want to rewatch old series, when we had good and mostly neutral story, with some basic moral and questions. Deploy your negatives.","rating":"5\/10","date":"14 March 2020"}

{"title":"Not Star Trek, ruined.","review":"It's unfortunate, Star trek TNG is my favorite show of all time, and this does not come close to recreating any of the excitement.\nThe characters and a small number of the actors overlap, but that's where the overlap ends. Everything else about it makes it a different show and experience completely, and not in a good way.Approach:\nThe storyline does not unfold in a typical Star Trek fashion, where there is a dilemma and a mission to resolve it; but rather it's more like Lost where something happens that you don't have a clue about, and it gets explained slowly over time and through flashbacks. Not good.The style:\nShips use a UI that is more like a tablet of today, with scrolling and pinching motions, except on a holographic display. It's more like they are copying Avatar than Star Trek. The effects are cool but inapropriate. If anything the future would have neural interfaces.\nThe language is crass with fbombs, which is not dignified alongside Admiral Picard. This is Star Trek and I want to be able to watch it with my family, not an adult action movie. Totally out of character and tacky.\nThere is a lot of cheesey cliche too. Like how every episode has Picard harping on about earl grey tea. Just do it once or twice. Remember what this kind of cheesey cliche approach did for indiana Jones 4?Storyline:\nFinally the storyline just isn't very good. It's boring. It feels like they could have told this storyline in one or 2 episodes but instead they have dragged it out over an entire season. The whole beauty of Star Trek is that each episode is stand alone and has its own plot\/mission. But Picard is more like a full movie that had been broken us into segments. And moves very slowly in a strange order.Overall I see this as a totally new scifi show that hasn't got much to do with the real Star Trek or Picard, with a weak story and poor execution.","rating":"2\/10","date":"19 April 2020"}

{"title":"I just don't care about the characters...","review":"This show is so worried about hitting random plot points it hasn't really bothered to round out the characters so you can invest in them.So you meet the cool android Dahj and then she dies. They drop in Seven of Nine then she disappears. Then she comes back and takes over all the drones in the Borg cube and you're thinking \"wow this is gonna be awesome!\" then all the drones are shot out into space. Then we turn up at Riker and Troi's place and then leave.The creator of Soji and Dahj is introduced and then killed instantly. Raffi's back story is bludgeoned into your face then removed again.These are all symptoms of a writing staff that really have no idea what they're doing. I mean, the series is only 10 episodes long, it's not that hard to write stuff to fill those episodes. Except it seems like the episodes are empty because the pacing is so slow.Nostalgia got me through the first two or three episodes but I'm really struggling to find motivation to watch the remainder (there are two left). The issue is i just don't care what happens to any of the characters. None of them are sympathetic. Even Picard comes off as a lost and bewildered a lot of the time.Waste of time and money for me.

{"title":"There's no Star Trek left in new Trek","review":"The spirit of Gene Roddenberry has all but been sapped out of Star Trek. It's like these writers don't understand or even care about the characters or the world built in previous series and movies. Instead of the old star fleet of professional officers, we basically get a show written as a teen drama with emotionally immature characters but one staring old actors instead. It makes me wonder who they have writing this stuff or who they think the Star Trek audience even is. The first season felt like a sub par Next Gen movie. It wasn't terrible and was entertaining enough to keep me interested but it was already the weakest addition to the franchise aside from Star Trek Discovery. By the second season, I'm already dropping off. Ive watched every single episode of every single Star Trek but I've fallen asleep several times with this one. There's nothing challenging about it. Nothing trek. Just the usual brain dead platitudes to show the audience how enlightened the writers of the show are and boring sci fi story lines we've seen countless times. It's not only not good, it does that thing that movies and tv shows have been doing lately where they just become insufferable and full of them selves. It's like the writers are putting way too much of themselves in place of who these characters are.","rating":"2\/10","date":"17 April 2022"}
{"title":"Space Geezers.","review":"Serious space travel (sci-fi and real) is for the young and, perhaps, the middle aged. If you disagree, check out the often uncomfortable-to-watch STAR TREK: PICARD (ST:P). Here a number of actors reprise their roles from nearly three decades ago. Some look like they have held up well; others not so much. The star of ST:P, Patrick Steward, seems to be somewhere in between. His Picard character acts, looks, and sounds like the octogenarian actor Steward is. But he appears to move about well. Nonetheless, it seems incredulous to see him ostensibly commanding space ships and heading landing parties in Hans Solo style.Season One.Steward's bland, unchanging expression and presence in many scenes seems like it might as well have been digitally pasted in. Rather than remaining front and center, the Picard character can end up on the sidelines as an observer which clearly illustrates that the show intends to proceed with or without superfluous (bookend?) appearances by Steward. The most watchable scenes are usually those without the Picard character.Picard survives all this by becoming an android. But Steward's new existence could still benefit from some (more?) digital make-up plus some (more?) re-recording to eliminate the distraction of his mumbling, weak, hoarse, and cracking voice.Directing\/editing is hit or miss. Pacing is generally lethargic and things often limp along between fight-scene set places. Scripts are far from original and some are ridiculously padded to extend individual show lengths and the number of shows. Special effects, especially exterior scenes, can look obviously fake and cheesy such as repetitive scenes of the Golden Gate Bridge that looks like a toy model. (Some sets may be knockoffs from THE EXPANSE.) The score is rather generic except for the impressive opening and closing credits. That said, the score can be the most dynamic (and, hence, interesting) part of otherwise sleepy scenes.Season Two.This is not the usual Star Trek space opera franchise. Rather, it is a time-travel opera with multiple blossoming romances and a conventional happy ending (that includes the Borg!).The initial show starts off as a whimper: a rambling (and endless) Picard character expository and an obsession on growing grapes (not even in space!). The script soon descends into chaos and lunacy, and never seems to recover for the duration of the series. Jeff Russo's powerful score comes to the rescue none too soon and (fortunately) stays there as the season unfolds. Russo's music is really the star of the show! Movie-theater grade special effects provide life support (it's hard to find a scene without CGI). Unfortunately, the quality of effects shots deteriorates as the season progresses and become cheesy in the closing episodes (a victim of wrap-up rush and\/or dwindling financial resources?).Time travel sagas are always a struggle for writers to get straight! The script is mostly focused on Picard's memories (which may be far from perfect at his age) where what is \"remembered\" has yet to occur. The trick of using a space ship to travel back in time has been used before, but returning to the future sans a ship seems to suffer from writers lacking imagination! Moreover, time-line impacts on the future due to changes in past events are given lip service at best.Script writers appear obsessed with the amateur psychoanalysis of the Picard character; life in a vineyard riddled with hidden tunnels, dungeons, monsters (but, sadly, no dragons); and a suicidal mother trying to comfort a psychologically lost very young Picard (the latter appears in the same scene or is glimpsed in the background ad nauseam!).Acting is all over the map from the enjoyable (especially the character played by actress Sol Rodriguez) to the tolerable but hammy (from principal supporting players) to the painful (the title character). There is also a fair amount of what looks like ad libbing.This season could benefit from leading off with a summary of the previous season. After all, its been over two years since the last one (which was far from memorable).How many producer types does it take to screw in a light bulb or, in this case, screw up a show? It looks like this production was \"producer sourced.\" Sure the script writers can be held accountable for the mess, but the multi layers of \"checkbook or in-kind\" producers should probably share much of the blame. Way too many cooks (and wannabe cooks)?ST:P seems to be a show designed to shore up nostalgia in its aging and dwindling core base of fans while trying (disparately?) to grow that base. The outcome for either does not look particularly promising given this entry. Recommend fast forwarding through the Picard character scenes or, better still, turning off the video and just enjoying the music. Viewed on disc.

{"title":"Not Much Going for It","review":"I went in with a very open mind and tried to stop my opinion of this show be sullied by my love of Star Trek in general. I'm sorry but it wasn't great.The show starts off with some, but not too much, nostalgia which is great but then diverges into an absolute mess of a story with multiple dead ends and huge plot holes. Take the familiar characters and uniforms out of it and it could be any bland sci fi. It's far too dystopian for Star Trek for one.Star Trek also always had dark moments, take ds9 for one, but there was always optimism and positivity at the end. Picard is just needless gore and unlikeable characters living in a ruined part of the galaxy.The way they treat the character of Picard in this is nothing short of a disgrace too. The final episode of TNG showed an elderly Picard, the main cast didn't trust he was completely \"with it\" but respected him enough to give him the benefit of the doubt which proved fruitful in the end because it was bloody Jean Luc Picard! In this show everyone seems to forget what he has done in the past. Even if the Romulan evacuation was a failure how was he to blame? Starfleet definitely was in this case and they are so petty that they are passing the blame on to Picard and completely ruining the character. Don't get me started on the Admiral randomly swearing at Picard for no reason, she's in uniform, on duty, tone it down. I'm all for swearing but not just for shock value which this show seems to do quite well, case and point with Icheb getting his eye ripped out on screen really for no reason.This was not Star trek. You can call me nostalgic, you can call me a whiney fan boy all you want but I don't care. I could excuse some of the show's failings but the story was awful, there was no focus to the script, no substance, it was a mess of a show, no character development and too much \"Pew Pew\".

Besides this, the poor and repeticous writing, the dragging out of terrible and boring storylines, the strange feel of it all that has nothing to do with the star trek universe is just saddening. A lot could have been done, especially with 7 of 9 and the Borg Queen or the Borg in general, also with Q. But nothing comes of it. Alison Pill is a delight, but what can she do with that writing? Nothing, exactly. Series 1 was not good, but enough to give the 2nd series a chance. Now they hit rock bottom, I just ran through the last 3 episodes on fast forward.

{"title":"EXCITING FIRST EPISODE THEN A PLOD","review":"I was, am and always will be a fan of the Star Trek franchinese. This Picard series is not pulling it off for me at all. Here's why..... 1. The series is one plot; it is not episodic...This departure at the structural level has single handedly destroyed the show's immediacy. 2. This has lead to a drawn out, turbid hand wringing slowness that is very grey and boring. There is hardly any new technology and aliens are STILL just humanoid with various bobble heads.3. There is virtually nothing that is particularly spacey....It's all a bit front room, bar or quasi medieaval.4. The nod to diversity is obvious with all nationalities and skin hues taken care of except the Chinese and Middle east. That is a bit sad. The fact that Black Romulans have only just shown up is slightly surprising and equally surprising are the new Irish accents? Where have they been for the last 45 years? No explanation given that I could discern. 5. Everyone seems so indecisive and there is only really one mission. This makes the show less heroic and epic. 6. So far, no Borg, No Cardassians & no Klingons or Ferenghi.....Did they catch the Coronavirus & just cease to exist? On the positive side, all I can say tis that it is nice to see all the old faces.

{"title":"Where did it all Gowron?","review":"I knew the second it was announced that Patrick Stewart was reappraising his role that this was going to be a disaster. The whole thing reeked of desperation. Trek fans don't want to be bribed with nostalgia, they want to be inspired by awesome, competently written thought-provoking, hopeful, sci-fi stories which show a future in keeping with Roddenberry's vision.Why on earth would you hire writers who have never watched an episode of star trek? Who are not well versed in the lore, or its rich history? Who are allergic to technobabble, and proper, intelligent, science fiction stories? And, who clearly do not understand what Trek was, why it was so unique and so well-loved? The problem is not the social commentary-trek has always done this, the problem is the unimaginative writing and the abandonment of the original single-episode format.I think the truth is, they hired a bunch of writers who did not want to be burdened with having to fill the shoes of the amazing writers who penned TNG, DS9 and Voyager. These guys really did not want to write a star trek show. They wanted to do their own thing, which is fine, and given how hard it is to get a studio interested in a new sci-fi show (I get it), but they instead decided to appropriate the name of one of the most beloved shows in history in the hope that it would guarantee big audiences, which it didn't.

Next when you thought the writing couldn't get much worse, suddenly you are taken back by Admirals in the federation dropping f-bombs... as if swearing could make up for such horrible writing. It was beyond belief bad.When you don't think it can get much worse, the script destroys the values that makes star trek not just a great show, but a \"hope\" for humanities achievement to not self destruct, and expand into space. The writers decided to add today's social concepts into the script, such as marketing Ad's popping up in the space ship bridge ... yes... marketing ad's ...As a uber super Trek fan, esp. STNG -- this show represents such a huge disappointment... so bad, I don't think Kurtzman has the compentency to create something this bad -- it must have been some combination of CBS pressure for profit along with larger scale script decisions via committee meetings at CBS with nobody having a clue what Star Trek means...The result -- a large pile of steaming excrement that's only value is the name of the show, and Patrick Stewart ... whom I feel so sorry for ... he's doing the best he can, but I know deep down inside him, he knows this show is going to be a huge blemish to what would otherwise be a stellar career.","rating":"1\/10","date":"28 June 2020"}

I also grew to love ST TNG, ST DS9 as an adult and was ecstatic when we had our first female captain in Voyager. But the most gratifying was being able to sit down and watch Voyager with my children, seeing the joy and anticipation for the next episode, the hope for a better future through their eyes, sharing stories of people who were inspired into certain career fields by the show - it doesn't get any better than that. Sadly, this is something you can't do with this show! To CBS, don't ever expect me or my family to watch\/pay anything made by Kurtzman or with the Kelvan timeline.

I finally figured out, and this is confirmed by the show creators, that Picard is a stand-in for white european colonialist, misogynistic and entitled men throughout the last several centuries. He's there not to be the Picard you remember, he's there to take a beating. He will fail, he will need powerful, woke females to do everything for him, he will be sat down and scolded by a female standing over him in each and every episode. He will be called dismissive names, \"JL\".. he will be sworn at with the foulest language used in any Star Trek TV or movie. His sins will be laid bare and he will be clueless except to beg for forgiveness to the women on the show.Beyond that there will be plot holes to drive a starship through and even if you are enjoying this show, the ending is baffling to the point of insult.","rating":"1\/10","date":"25 July 2020"}

We have another team member also who refuses to join the team, then later has second thoughts & joins the team. But wait! We need a pilot and a ship. Can you say Hans Solo copy cat? We get a ne'er do well handsome playboy pilot who's doing it for the money.\nOh, did I tell you it's a dull and boring show that for some reason must give a paycheck to all of the STNG actors?

{"title":"The horror, the horror!","review":"I wouldn't consider myself a die-hard treky, but I have seen and enjoyed DS9, TNG, and Voyager. What we have in Star Trek Picard is neither Star Trek, nor a good show. There are many reviews to that effect already, so I will try to be as succinct as possible:1. Soundtrack and opening sequence - lackluster, not memorable, not inspiring, with no hope of becoming iconic or easily recognizable2. Futuristic technology - unimaginative (in the 60s they had a better idea and execution of what future technology would be like)3. Not a family show - 2 f-bombs in the second episode, both by women4. Main character - old, frail, visibly struggling as opposed to strong, awe-inspiring captains of the respectable installments of the Star Trek series5. Characters in places of authority - all women, but not good ones - swearing admiral, angry Romulan commodore, poison-spewing Romulan sister. Seems like feminists are trying to shoot themselves in the foot.6. Camera work - horrendous to say the least, angles from behind with half the heads cut off, angles from below, sunrays, reflections, odd glares. Amateurs can do better.7. Speech tempo and vocab - too fast, too vernacular, trying too hard to sound scientific, but failing to give the audience time to process8. Young actors - no charisma, no skill, no personality9. Star Trek shows always had a self-contained story per episode as well as an all-encompassing arc. Nothing of the sort here. It is one long overextended story broken into segments.10. At the core of Star Trek there is always nobility, striving towards higher ideals and a better version of oneself, hope, positivity. This show is bleak, bitter, angry.11. Picard gets cussed at by a Starfleet admiral, Romulans are servants to humans, Data's daughters are plain slutty (cannot hold a candle to Lal) - this cannot possibly be conceived as part of the Star Trek legacy. This is not Star Trek, this is Star Trash.","rating":"2\/10","date":"1 February 2020"}
{"title":"Optimistic but worried","review":"Having now watched two episodes I am optimistic for the future of this series, but there are a few important things to comment on. The premise is good, with all sci-fi we have to suspend some disbelief, so the use of license in some of the traditional star trek tropes is OK, just don't go as far as Discovery which broke the mold and crushed it.My biggest concerns are around script, direction and acting. It seems now that to writers for TV are trying to dumb down characters. Why in a supposedly enlightened future are high ranking officers using expletives to make points? Did humanity regress to a lesser state? The writers in many series do this, and usually it comes with a loss in ratings (just look at the last series of Designated Survivor). Beyond that, the credibility of characters is damaged by the weak acting and direction, for example since when did Romulans have Irish accents? yeah yeah I can't be too picky here given a so called french guy has an English accent, but at least that is more established. Surely actors have not lost the ability to character act?So in short, the potential is there, it may be too late for the first season, but lets see. I hope this can have legs and be brought back to a more enlightened Star Trek world.","rating":"5\/10","date":"1 February 2020"}

{"title":"Too many cooks","review":"Season 2 update: Not Star Trek, not Picard.Picard continues to show that Kurtzman et al have no clue or real care about Star Trek, and its painfully bad to watch.There are so many stupid character decisions and things that long-term Star Fleet officers would NEVER do, especially when dealing with time travel.Speaking of time travel, this show is jumping the shark HARD in the second season.The number of stupid decisions and characters is truly astounding. I would have thought it hard to do, but Kurtzman has managed to make me dislike Jean-Luc Picard. In this show he is an egotistical, moronic, stupid character that thinks a very old man should still be an action star, for some reason, even though Picard was never an action-based character (outside of the movies). It was his intellect and adherence to Star Fleet and doing what is right over what is easy that made him stand out.The universe of Star Trek, once a hopeful and optimistic view of what humanity COULD become is now a wretched show about how nasty the human race truly is, in Kurtzman's view.Do yourself and the world a favor. Do not watch this show. If you have, stop watching it.Older review below.If you're looking for something that feels even remotely like the Star Trek you know and love (from literally any of the series before CBS got their hands on it), then this is NOT the show for you.Star Trek was a show based upon future humanity overcoming the majority of pettiness in a unified attempt to explore their galaxy and learn about the mysteries held there.This is true from the OG Star Trek up to even Discovery, and while each had varying takes on the formula, you could still *feel* the Star Trek in most of them (movies not included except for the OG movies).This show has more producer credits than cast and crew combined, and its helmed unfortunately by Alex Kurtzman. In the grand tradition of current remakes that have no real point or originality, CBS has been desperate to make Star Trek a thing again, yet they have no care in actual Star Trek and only care about more action, more killing, more swearing, more nonsense that doesnt hold up if you think about the events occurring. And under no circumstances is there supposed to ever be a feeling of STAR TREK in this Star Trek show.In my last paragraph I joked that there are more producers than any other cast, and thats honestly what it feels like. Oh, sure, theres extras walking around waiting to get blown up, decapitated, disintegrated, shot full of holes, etc., but the actual cast of the show is roughly 8 people.Unfortunately, the newest additions are painfully bad, with the Soji twins being of particular note here. She has no agency, no real character, no growth or anything worth noting. She is essentially a human mcguffin there to just make the plot sort of happen. And sort of happen it does!If you want to take the skin of the Star Trek universe and then shove The Fast and Furious underneath, then just create a new show! If that sentence sounds exciting to you, then you just may be the target audience!!If you like Star Trek, skip this, if you like sci-fi, skip this, if you like Sir Patrick Stewart with his sheer Fing hubris, skip this, if you want to see old actors retake their mantles, just watch those few episodes with them then sigh in disappointment.The plot of the show thus far is nonsensical within the Star Trek universe. Everyone, with the exception of the old crew, seem to have their own secret plots, which in turn seem to only exist as an 'in hindsight' moment, where the show wouldnt make ANY sense, so they went back, added 15 new producers, and wrote in scenes to try to cobble it together. It truly feels like Alex Kurtzman was a 'woke' 12 year old they hired to give them ideas and then tried to create some semblance of a story.A. K.: \"I like ninja assassins!\", Producer 13: Ninja assassins are too male centric! I KNOW LETS MAKE ONE COME FROM A SECT OF FEMALE ASSASSIN NUNS!A. K.: \"Robots are cool! Data is cool!\", Producer 7: BORG AND DATA ARE BACK BABYYYYY except wait... data wont hold up as being Data so we'll just show him a bit in dream sequences... and to make it appeal to a female audience, Data has a daughter, NO TWIN DAUGHTERS!! TWIN DAUGHTERS THAT HE HIMSELF CREATED!!!! YES! I CAN SMELL THE MONEY ON ITS WAY ALREADYA. K.: \"I like space explosions!\", Producers 3, 7, 22, and 41: Hell yea space explosions rock!This show is not Star Trek. Picard is NOT the Picard you knew, nor are any of the others from TNG.This is not a 1 star show due to the work that went into it, but nowadays special effects arent much of a draw anymore. The practical effects they do use are sometimes nice, sometimes very stupid (like the Romulan town that hasnt changed AT ALL in decades and is still a space western town.... A. K.: I LIKE DESERT WESTERN TOWNS!!!

{"title":"Disappointment of the year","review":"I did not expect much after Discovery and from Kurtzman and Chabon in particular but was still surprised how bad this show is. It is not Star Trek, but its not even mediocre as a generic SF-Show.\nWe see some actors from the former series who play characters which I do not recognize. Picard is some pathetic old man, Sevenofnine is some random action-hero and Riker shows up for Nottingham more than Pizza and Fanservice. The new cast is not nearly interesting enough to keep me invested for a whole season or even a single episode.\nThe story is not original, stretched like an old chewing gum, contains more plotholes that I can count and the dialogue is often just pathetic and\/or laughable. So many scenes who are just filler, so many things that just don't make sense.\nWho gave green light for these scripts?

No.\nDoes this take star trek in am exciting direction with a better way to express the heart of star trek for a modern audience? Also, no.\nDoes the reduction of a season to 10 episodes a season mean the series has better quality writing? Very much no, a random selection of 10 tng, voyager, ds9 or season 2\/3 of enterprise is still much better experience than this series\nDoes this combine a bunch of bland, current pop sci-fi ideas, seen in any generic sci-fi movie\/book\/series, and dress it in the history built up by star trek with out any joy of the originals? Mostly yes.Did I enjoy the series? Mostly no.\nVerdict: Unless there is a complete 180 degree turn back to good story telling and probably a completely different crew of characters you might as well just leave the tv off or watch something filling the role star trek used to have like The Orville, The Good Life or, if you want action, maybe try My Hero Academia.","rating":"1\/10","date":"25 June 2020"}
{"title":"I try to like it, then I don't, then I sort of do...they're playing with Trek fans' loyalties","review":"I've tried to like Discovery. I will give it yet another chance when it resumes if it does (apparently so, after Picard finishes season 1) because the way last season ended, at least they're 900 years in the future now so they don't have to worry about any prequel BS, 'canon' and so on (why Trek shows, or any shows, try to do prequels is beyond me, just makes it more difficult than it need be)...I've tried to like Picard, and I sort of do but...it's kinda boring. The most recent episode I saw, \"The Impossible Box' got good, sort of, but took a long time to get there. Currently watching Nepenthe which brings back Troi and Riker but I doubt even they can save it.So I've realized, yeah, I know, duh...the same folks running this show (at least one of them,Alex Kurtzman) are same folks who did the 'reboot' movies with original series characters (first two movies were decent I thought, third one was just action movie BS) and same folks doing Discovery.So you have yet another dark, slow-moving, serialized show (which is funny because I loved DS9 yet...). why can't they, please, return to episodic TV? why is every TV show nowadays a serial? no wonder I don't watch much TV. you can maintain a story line, as TNG did, without having to serialize it. you can do the main arc, as DS9 did, if you have an arc, but also do stand alone episodes as you move along with the narrative, inserting what you need in the episodes to carry it further. but, no, aparently. so what we now have with Discovery and Picard is an ongoing narrative bereft of the initial wonder of Trek, no discovery, no exploration, no new aliens and wonders of the universe to encounter and\/or figure out each week...sad.Yet as a Trek loyalist since the days of the original series, I keep tuning in, hoping, as do many people like me. So the producers are playing with us and we're suckers for it.Bottom line: the original series and TNG, and to a lesser extent the rest up to Enterprise were, for me, Trek shows I wanted to repeat view because I enjoyed them so much and I've seen original series and TNG episodes literally probably hundreds of times, many are like me, we know the dialog by heart, etc. etc. There's just a magic to those shows.There's no magic to these new 'imaginings' of Trek. I have no desire or compulsion whatsoever to repeat view any of the movie reboots, Discovery or Picard. Because there's no magic.But, I don't begrudge those who enjoy the new shows. And I will keep watching them, hoping, out of Trek loyalty. But, I continue to be disappointed. Then again, when Enterprise was cancelled I was disappointed because I thought it was improving, but I and I would presume many others were fine with the franchise shutting down. Nobody asked for reboots or new series or, at least, certainly not what we've been given since. Sigh.","rating":"3\/10","date":"1 March 2020"}
{"title":"Could have been worse.","review":"ST:Picard, could have been worse but it would have taken some serious effort.Up until now I thought ST:Enterprise was the worst I had seen of the franchise (have not seen ST: Discovery), mainly because I found Scott Bakula to be simply awful. Not sure if it was the writing or Scott, but I found the charachter to be terrible and rather childish.But now, I would rather re-watch ST:Enterprise than ST:Picard. The writing and acting in ST:Picard was so bad it made ST:Enterprise look good. An amazing feat.Plenty of others here have pointed out all that is wrong with ST:Picard, so I don't need to. Just read the <5 star reviews. They are pretty accurate IMO.STNG was not great the first year, so maybe there is hope, but I doubt it. I'll wait to read the reviews on ST:Picard season 2 before deciding if I will bother to watch.EDIT: Still showing 7.4 rating on IMDB.

{"title":"It doesn't feel like Star Trek. It's a bad series.","review":"I was looking forward to this, but it fails to deliever what it initially promissed. First of all it doesn't feel like Star Trek at all. It contradicts most of the known Star Trek CANON. It also portrays humans as some greedy and malevolent capitalists. That's not what Star Trek is about...Federation society in Star Trek was mostly an utopian egalitarian communist society, whereas in \"Star Trek: Picard\" it seems like capitalism is still the driving force among humans. For example Raffi doesn't seem to have any money or ressources and lives in some run-down-container in the desert. She is abusing drugs. Absolutely ridiculous.That whole plot with the rebelling Androids and Romulans wanting to destroy all cybernetic and robotic life is ridiculous and contradicts canon. It also seems that some Romulan secret agency can freely move on earth and bomb things without repercussions. Where is earth police? Where is section 31? Where is Starfleet? Don't they have sensors and cameras to notice something like this happening?All Starfleet vessels seem to be of the same class at the beginning of the 25th century. Starfleet always employed multiple ship classes. Was CGI for many different ship classes too expensive? The Romulan Star Empire was huge, with hundreds of worlds, spanning dozens of light years, but the Romulans are incapable of evacuating their own homeworld? Seems rather unlikely. That whole storyline regarding the cloning of biorobots from Positrons seems rather incoherent. Picard in TNG was a wise leader and figure of authority. Old Picard in the new series is a naive and weak person. Most of the characters are clich\u221a\u00a9d, annoying and oversimplified. The comeback of the Borg, Seven of Nine and Hugh was unnecessary, because it added nothing to the storyline.They should enlist better writers, e.g. Ronald D. Moore and Manny Coto. They know how to make a good Star Trek and SciFi Series. Or maybe Seth Mcfarlane. He is a big Star Trek Fan and creator of \"THE ORVILLE\".\"Star Trek was an attempt to say that humanity will reach maturity and wisdom on the day that it begins not just to tolerate, but take a special delight in differences in ideas and differences in life forms. [...] If we cannot learn to actually enjoy those small differences, to take a positive delight in those small differences between our own kind, here on this planet, then we do not deserve to go out into space and meet the diversity that is almost certainly out there.\" - Gene Roddenberry","rating":"4\/10","date":"12 September 2020"}

{"title":"Terrible writing and little quality control","review":"Season 1 was okay and I expected it to improve and mature with Season 2. Instead it's the worst Star Trek I've ever seen. Half the regular characters from S1 were abandoned, and the rest given personality transplants. The quality of writing is terrible, with dialogue that makes one cringe. And the plot is preposterous. In one scene, a character asks the computer to extrapolate a 2D video to 3D, then proceeds to meet in the extrapolation a person who wasn't in the video and has a conversation. Is this sci-fi or Harry Potter? I feel bad for Patrick Stewart.","rating":"4\/10","date":"10 August 2022"}

{"title":"An even worse desecration of Roddenbury's legacy than Discovery","review":"Why oh why do the writers of modern Trek keep doing this? Lately Star Trek has seemed to become one deep chasm to throw dark storylines and \"progressive\" pandering into along with lots of murder, murder, crying, killing off main characters for no reason, more crying, more murder, and then some clever quip by a main character.I appreciate that it doesnt pander AS much as Discovery but it's still absoloutely awful, and it does have some powerful scenes, like Data's final death, regardless of how much fan service it really is.This...\nThis is not Star Trek. It's a giant pandering multi-parter action movie, written by and for people with the IQ of a wooden plank.","rating":"2\/10","date":"26 June 2022"}
{"title":"I'm nostalgic for when Star Trek used to be good","review":"I watched all of Season 1 which was inconsistent but sort of watchable. This season started off with two ok episodes but has totally self-destructed now. It's actually unpleasant to watch, like witnessing someone desecrate a beautiful piece of art.I finally gave up watching full episodes after the sixth, and then just skipped through the last two to see if things got better. Nope, nope, nope. It's totally beyond redemption now.I despair for the new Star Trek: Strange New Worlds series because it has the same creative team as Picard and Star Trek: Discovery (also now a piece of steaming garbage). I think Star Trek as a franchise it doomed unless someone else takes over the creative reins.","rating":"2\/10","date":"22 April 2022"}
{"title":"This is not Roddenberry's vision","review":"Gene Roddenberry's Star Trek was a vision of an optimistic, hopeful future whereas ST: Picard is a violent, potty-mouthed, dystopian hellscape where the previously popular main character, once admired for being a professional, honourable and ethical leader is now hated by absolutely everyone around him for no reason whatsoever other than him being an old man. Whoever Patrick Stewart is playing it is certainly not Jean-Luc Picard, he displays none of his authority, humility and mannerisms. None of the supporting characters are vaguely interesting or likeable due to the aggressive dialogue and emotional breakdowns. The plot is an incoherent mess with no respect for continuity and the SFX are surprisingly poor for the budget. All in all a complete disappointment and a trashing of Roddenberry's legacy.","rating":"1\/10","date":"17 May 2022"}
{"title":"Trek gets even sillier than Discovery","review":"This series is a bit sad. It uses a Trek icon (Patrick Stewart) to squeeze a few more dollars out of the franchise's reputation. As many have pointed out, where are the Federation ideals that Gene Roddenberry based his entire original concept on? It shouldn't be a surprise, as Discovery had already proven to us that you can be a two-time mutineer and still be a Starfleet officer. Dumb gets even dumber this time around, with a very old Picard and a rogue crew off to save the galaxy, because the Federation doesn't do that sort of thing anymore. It hurts to see something I love so much turn into dross like this.","rating":"4\/10","date":"21 March 2020"}
{"title":"I stopped watching","review":"Did I expect the same as the next generation? No, they already said it would be different. But it is still about Picard so there is still some history. And to my he looks like an old and sad man, like a hero of sport who is loosing more and more of his glance. It feels like bleh.So ok, a different view on the world etc. I understand and I give it a fair chance. It is not a reboot, so it continues the story of Picard. But I am not interested in his story anymore after wachting half the season. What do I care what happens with the main characters? I have no bonding with them. So maybe I am to old to get this kind of show making. But it is boring for me and also the action scenes...The special affects are nice, the acting is also nice I think, but it look like they are instructed wrong or the story is just too bad... I do not know. But I will not watch it anymore. Maybe a few years later I will watch it again and think: oh, why I did not like this? But for now I am not getting it...","rating":"4\/10","date":"29 February 2020"}
{"title":"Talentless, shameless hacks","review":"Just like how Star Trek Discovery awkwardly inserted its dull, preachy, soulless, and unlikable characters into the backstory of our beloved classic Star Trek legends of old - thus retroactively taking credit for everything that happened afterwards. Star Trek Picard sees fit to alter the fundamental nature of the Federation, Starfleet, and basically everything else in this world. It's turned Starfleet itself into a diverse hire paradise where every single senior officer is female. It takes established and beloved characters that we grew to know over the years or even decades and deconstructs them into obscene parodies of themselves. This show undermines the basic message of hope and optimism. Instead, it presents a bleak, hostile, greedy dystopian version of the Star Trek universe. It revels in gore, torture, violence and destruction, in a show that once had taken a higher path using rationality, understanding and diplomacy to solve problems. It does all of this, and for what, to tell a story that nobody wanted in the first place. To explore ideas that have already been handled by past better writers. To seamlessly forcing the creator's political views that none of us asked for or care about. Or was it just to squeeze the last remnants of fun enthusiasm from a franchise that pretty much has been run to the ground by people who don't know what the hell they're doing.Star Trek Picard is just another sad example of what happens when arrogant, talentless, shameless hacks try to elevate their own mediocre work by standing on the shoulders of giants.","rating":"2\/10","date":"13 May 2021"}

{"title":"This is not Star Trek","review":"The special effects, cinematography and costumes are great but everything else is terrible. The plot and screen play are both laughably bad. Its as if the people responsible have never watched an episode of Star Trek, have no idea who Picard was and are filling in the massive blanks with Arguments on Twitter. If you enjoyed the any of the original series you will find this contrived and out of place in the star Trek universe.The Federation are apparently now Xenophobic, all 100 planets and dozens of races. The Romulan Star Empire is apparently incapable of evacuating their own homeworld without support from start Fleet and Picard and every other male character is apparently a weak passive shadow of what men in the real world act like. Why name a show after a character you plan to assassinate? Why bother to base the show around someone you obviously have zero respect for?In short give it a miss, it suffers from the same gender and race based motivated identity politics that drove Start Trek discovery, Starwars and Dr Who into the ground.","rating":"1\/10","date":"20 February 2020"}

The obvious plot devices and characters we have come to know from being repeated in Star Trek over and over and over again to death, like the dead horse the franchise has become over the last years.This feels like the first TNG season, just without any useful subtext, positive outline or vision.You can geek out bout Patrick Stewards performance or all the nostalgia sprinkled in every other frame, but that doesn't make this a good show to watch.","rating":"3\/10","date":"8 February 2020"}

{"title":"Mourning the loss of the writer's craft.","review":"I'm not really a fan of any particular franchise, but I've seen all of the Star Trek seasons, except for Discovery, which I felt did its own thing outside of the franchise's spirit.\nOne can argue the quality of Star Trek over its past iterations, but one thing seems to become apparent in modern day series and movies, and that's the decline, no per se in quality, but in the craftsmanship of writing. There don't seem many artisans left in this trade, or maybe there are just too many productions and there is no time or willingness in this next you-tube generation to dedicate themselves to this craft.\nIt's all left to the craft of the movie-makers to turn the blank spaces on the page into meaningful screen-time.I love Patrick Stewart, a high quality actor, but unfortunately even he can't lift this series off the ground. The script is very slim, almost to the point I thought this was originally written as a movie, and got rewritten into a series.\nThe series is slow, because many scenes live long past their existential reason. Emotional exposition is painstakingly lingered upon and there is a distinct lack of interesting interactions between the characters. There's an overarching story, and everyone floats about the current. Instead of looking for engrossing the viewer into the intricacies of its world and characters, it chooses gratuitous action to counterbalance its otherwise bleak canvas.This series needs an infusion of side plots and deeper character exploration leading to more meaningful moral, political or interpersonal conflicts, the latter remaining very shallow in current episodes.","rating":"5\/10","date":"4 March 2020"}
{"title":"This is not Star Trek.","review":"I loved The Next Generation and was very excited to see this when I took out my free trial of Amazon Prime. I made it to the end of the series but was left deeply unsatisfied and more than a touch disappointed.In film and TV the future can be anything you want it to be. The thing I liked best about all of the Star Treks I saw was they went out of their way to show humanity has learnt from the mistakes we have made and are still making now. This gave me hope which became what Star Trek was all about for me.I am not prudish but what did the bad language add to the story here? I do not want to imagine a future where sucking on a fat cigar is still considered \"cool\". ST Picard strips away all that is good about Star Fleet and makes it just another political body that has learnt nothing from history. It may be \"real\" and I have no objection to this vision being explored in other films or series but it has no place in Star Trek.Add to that some of the characters are distinctly dodgy. Rios is a very poor imitation of Hans Solo, the baddies ham it up to pantomime levels and I find Raffi and Elnor particularly unconvincing.I enjoyed the cameos of a few of the old TNG gang and whilst the storyline was not the most original it was not as bad as people are making out. Sadly though, the overall feeling I have been left with is disappointment.","rating":"2\/10","date":"5 February 2021"}

I think both \"Picard\" and \"Data\" (and all the other characters as well for that matter ) deserved a much better fate than this.If you watched and enjoyed TNG then think twice before you watch this.

{"title":"Sci fi flick cloaked in the Star Trek brand","review":"As a regular sci fi flick, the show is not too bad. The special effects are nice and it's pretty interesting. The biggest issue is for a 10 episode season, the setup is taking half the season. The plot isn't terrible compelling and it's taking alot of time for it to get off the runway. With that said, let's talk about the elephant in the room. Why is exactly is this called Star Trek? Every franchise has their own brand. You go see Fast and Furious because you want to see cars and stupid crazy action. You see Mission Impossible for the thrill of the ride. Star Wars mythology and battle between light and dark is engrossing. The Star Trek brand is known for presenting real world human problems in a very unique (sci-fi) way that allows us to judge the entire picture objectively. It's obvious that the writers and show runners understand Star Trek in a superficial way with superficial fan service. I'm all for making changes, but I also think it's important that Roddenberry's vision be at the core of each show. At the core of his vision, he saw a united and harmonious humanity that had respect for all life. The fact that the writers suggested starfleet\/humanity has lost respect for Picard because of his compassion towards the Romulans fly in the face of Roddenberry's vision. With Roddenberry no longer around to set up rules for Star Trek writers, the brand is slowly becoming nothing more than 2 words.","rating":"5\/10","date":"16 March 2020"}

All to soon realised as a subterfuge for poor writing and plot. Where do they go from here. Who knows and who cares. The show runners are clearly out of touch with its core audience.

Constantly we as audience know more of the story and character play catch up in the show that takes time and is boring.Introduce us a big bad apocalypse enemy then show a bit of it in the end and it gets solved to easy and is totally useless.

I watch sci-fi to escape the train wreck that our world has become. There is no hopeful future here. There is crime and death and darkness. I can turn on the news and see that. The characters are bland (especially the lady that calls Picard \"JL\"), the story is boring, and the attempt to make Star Trek edgy (the swearing, the sex, the bars, etc.) Is too much. I'd rather watch re-runs.","rating":"5\/10","date":"29 February 2020"}

My Lord, this so so, so bad. There are so many problems, so many things that do not make sense, and this is just the first episode. Kurtzman watched The Matrix too many times. The Federation doesn't act like the Federation. Evidently, now they're racist bad guys? There's a news lady that comes off as a parody of a \"Fix News\" correspondent ? Now they somehow \"cloned\" Data, and he has a....daughter? She fights guys in generic outfits like Neo? WTH? Didn't he get completely blown up in Star Trek Nemesis? Mars is attacked? The Romulans ( those that are left over from J.J. Abrams destruction of Romulus in J.J.'s revision of Star Trek ) are constructing....a Borg Cube?

Imagine a Blade Runner knock-off informed in a \"post-Game of Thrones world.\" Then in that, add odd 2nd rate classic Star Trek bit attempts that are just awkward; that are then accompanied by the classic theme music. (It feels almost like a talk show applause sign going off, informing you on what you should be feeling. It's just weird.)And everyone and their mom wastes no opportunity completely verbally beating up Picard every which way they can. (Some, inc starfleet, in a very vulgar fashion.) He's either constantly apologizing and agreeing how awful he is or just looking downtrodden and completely beaten as the abuse goes on.And then there's the Katana-weiding Middle Earth Elves, err, I mean Romulans. I can only imagine how silly that writer's roundtable was...If Trek means nothing to you, this may more around a 5 or 6. My three represents anyone coming from a Trek background.

{"title":"I'd prefer a lobotomy","review":"This series is depressing trainwreck that will appeal only to those with nothing else better to do with their time. Hours and hours of characters that are no different than any other of the myriad lame characters from previous ST series. The Borg subplot is interesting, and the special effects are well done. The most dislikeable character (so far) is Raffi, who seems to be channeling drama school with highly-emotive melodramatic 'acting'. She constantly refers to Picard as JL... which is constantly annoying.The Picard character, what to say? I'd opt for a lobotomy rather than watch 'Picard in his last years'. His scenes are consistently depressing slogs, and it's a shame that this will be one of Stewart's lesser pieces of work. It's clear that some executive must have held quite the bone in front of him to have him return as Picard. He should have left the bone where it was.","rating":"1\/10","date":"18 June 2020"}

You're like a minute in and your mind already shut off after 20 seconds. So you end up losing the plot. And speaking of plots, after 7 episodes in I still don't know what the plot is. Let alone what the story is actually about. You keep waiting for something to actually happen, anything vaguelly interesting and nothing happens. Just endless talking dispersed by the occasional action which lasts for a few seconds and then more endless talking. This series is a drama, has very little to do with Star Trek, and reckon the producers of this travesty deserve to be sent to the gulag for creating such an abomination.

{"title":"What is this show trying to be...?","review":"Like many of the reviews, I so wanted to enjoy this new chapter of Star Trek. The first episode was extremely promising with solid production and potential for a very strong story.\nUnfortunately I found the story telling, production, dialog and acting very inconsistent as the season progressed. One moment I was leaning into the story, then I was suddenly confused or irritated in where the story would go.\nThis show seemed to suffer from no one single vision. Felt like there were \"too many cooks in the kitchen\". I never really cared for the new characters and the older characters never got enough time. (Riker was great as always).I appreciate the creators trying to tie Picard\ninto the end of the last Star Trek TNG movie...but they also forgot to capture the spirit of what Star Trek TNG was all about from a story telling perspective.\nI unfortunately will not return for season 2...","rating":"3\/10","date":"21 May 2020"}

What is even worse- is it makes me rethink his performance in Logan. Was Sir Patty acting in that too - or was he just playing his curmudgeon self.I'm sorry- I watched the Next Gen for the heroic crew of the USS Enterprise led by the indomitable Captain Jean Luc Picard- not AARP member Sir Patty.Brent Spiner nailed Data. BUT given technology today- they could have de-aged him. I know effects cost money- but given the limited screen time- it's not like you are spending 1\/3 of Captain America The First Avenger making Chris Evans look smaller.I won't spend too much time blasting the rest of the acting - but Allison Pill plays her character like a stiff.As for the writing - the one hour episode played out like two hour snoozer. Pacing was slow. I immediately don't care about these people- the writers failed to reel me in.Effects- it's the future- at least try to make San Francisco look like the Abrams-verse.If I have to choose between the horrendous Doctor Who season 11 & 12 and this train-wreck of an episode - I'll choose Doctor Who- I don't have to pay for that.","rating":"1\/10","date":"24 January 2020"}

Maybe the environment changed, you changed or yous just simply grown out of it.I really can\u00c2\u00b4t tell what it is, that destructs me so much about that new Picard series. Maybe it is the really bad Alex Kurtzman script writing, the Jar Jar Abremesque directing or the simple fact that Star Trek Picard is becoming a Game of Thrones kind of game. Every scene is painted in a over dramatic manor. Every scene wants to be overwhelming, wants to catch the audience emotionaly, just wants to be to much of everything. But foremost it want\u00c2\u00b4s to change the charecter of a rational thinking, brillant Star Fleet captain\/addmiral into a emotional acting tattering old man, totally ingnoring a life time of responsible serving as a captain and an admiral. The most sad part is that it\u00c2\u00b4s getting worst and worst from episode to episode. Man I loved Sir Patrick playing Picard in TNG but I start to realy dislike him for playing in that stupid little series, full of darkness and violance called ST:Picard. This series has nothing and I mean absolutly nothing to do with Star Trek. It\u00c2\u00b4s just labeled with it.Gosh, maybe I\u00c2\u00b4m getting to old to enjoy the new Star Trek that it has unfortionaly become. Jar Jar and Kurtzman changed the whole game. Star Trek isn\u00c2\u00b4t about science, exploring and growing as mankind anymore. It has just became stupid. I guess that Gene Roddenberry is already turning in his grave.Also some of the reviews telling Trekster and Trekkis that this is not our Star Trek and we have to take it the way it is. I Say that Star Trek is nothing without it\u00c2\u00b4s fans and supporters. Without the guys who spending tons of time, passion and money (sometimes trevelling around the globe) to visit ST conventions in costumes and living their passion.

Star trek is based on a journey sorrounded by educating, science based stories including some humour some emotion and knowledge in every episode. New series has nothing to do with it. This is not assassin creed or guardians of galaxy. This is Star Trek for gods sake. We expect friendship, exploration, some astronomy, some adventure, new stories, positive characters. \"EXPLORATION\" remember?

Jump to now and we have Picard the tv series but instead of giving the fans what we want they give us agenda driven episodes with characters we care nothing about. The characters we do care about have been given dreadful lives with no real joy. This goes on for the first two seasons. Cut to season three and the full crew are back together again in a story that rips off plot elements from Wrath Of Khan and Search For Spock with another Starfleet conspiracy ala Undiscovered Country. Season three really isn't all that great. It wouldn't rank so high if the first two had been good. It just seems so derivative. We also get no explanations as to what happened to the Enterprise-E that has now been replaced by Enterprise-F which is quickly replaced again. With the way the Enterprise is treated and The Voyage Home referred to as that whale incident combined with how Kirk has been portrayed in the other current Treks,I feel like they would love to rewrite that part of Star Trek and downplay it's importance. However without that TNG would have never succeeded.

{"title":"There Are Better Fan Films","review":"Beam this into space and fire all your photon torpedoes at it. This series continues the mistake of confusing the milquetoast Jean-Luc from the TV series with the Kirkified Picard of the TNG movies, forgetting what made him different, if never very interesting.Season 1 jettisons much of what was foretold in the TNG series (marriage with Dr. Crusher, the Amish beard) and introduces a game, but feeble Picard, then surrounds him with boring characters. Which, to be fair, is the status quo. There is some blather about the corrupt Federation that goes nowhere and the first series ends with the idiotic decision to turn him into an android. So I skipped season 2 and read about it on Wikipedia. Trite nonsense.But season 3 was, according to many viewers, supposed to be a huge improvement. Alas, the producers (including Hollywood's least talented hack Akiva Goldsman) did not make it so. Picard sleepwalks through his scenes like a great grandpa brought to the reunion party and told where to stand for pictures.Characters from the TNG series are sprinkled back in, reminding us again after 30 years of their utter lack of charisma. Frakes is as wooden as ever, and his conflicts with Picard here fly in the face of everything we've been told about his boring character in the movies. Dr. Crusher has distractingly become one of the Son'a. And Worf was still played better by Christopher Judge in STARGATE SG1. Still, they're all better than the new sidekicks of the first two series, none of whom are worth noting or remembering. Unfortunately, for season 3 they kept Raffaela, who, even with the sound off during her scenes, still seems like she's desperate for an Emmy. Seven of Nine also returns, to glower once more.In a straight rip-off of a WOK plot point, Picard and Crusher had a son. Thank the Force for 25th century obstetrics. Although plastic surgery has not improved. And who knew that accents were genetic? (There's a handwave explanation for this, but it's dumb.) Out of character, she hid from Picard and her TNG fam for years (to shack up with an grandmother's boytoy??). Apparently Jack Crusher got recessive Borg genes from his dad and also his tendency to overact but not alas his hairline.Amanda Plummer hams it up as a villain, in one of series of many, many, many cheap and unearned callbacks to TOS. I mean, there is one in every scene, a piece of dialogue, a camera angle, a snatch of music - it's gratuitous and desperate. There's fan service and then there's exploitation of fan memories, which PICARD is.The sluggish pacing and the flat dialogue give the whole thing a sense of pantomime, as if the troupe if getting together for a charity video.Frankly, the only notable part of TNG - the Borg - have been beaten to death and there was no compelling reason to revisit the series except $$$. But please, please, please don't give us STAR TREK: KIRK. If anything we needed a CAPTAIN SULU.","rating":"1\/10","date":"29 May 2023"}

TNG maybe 8 times.I hope they bury Star Trek and forget about it.\nUntil a new generation of writers and producers takes a new approach to it.Star Trek is a good money maker. Just listen to what the fans want.\nBut we know they are not about money anymore, what they want is to change the political atmosphere and turn everyone in to a liberal brainless zombie.","rating":"1\/10","date":"31 March 2020"}

{"title":"Alternative Star Trek Universe with Space Ninjas","review":"I really want to like it and it's hard for me to give it such a low rating. I grew up with TNG and it has influenced my outlook on life significantly and even inspired me into a career in the space industry. TNG dominates my top 10 favorite sci-fi TV episodes. Picard will always be the best Enterprise captain in my opinion and Patrick Stuart has earned my respect for consistently excellent performances in other franchises too. After watching the first episode of Picard I was really surprised with what I saw. So I watched it again and I'm still surprised how different it is to the Star Trek I know so well and love. In the TNG there was a great episode where the Enterprise crew had to stop other universes merging with theirs. In that episode they had to destroy an Enterprise from a universe where the Borg had wiped out the federation and the crew didn't want to return to their reality. I kinda feel like Picard is set in one of those alternate universes, a Universe where character arcs are filled with non-sequiturs. I really hope it improves with the next episodes, but there is so much wrong with it that I don't have much hope.","rating":"4\/10","date":"25 January 2020"}

{"title":"Betrail to Star Trek","review":"First of all, don\u00c2\u00b4t believe the fake 10 star rating.I really can\u00c2\u00b4t tell what it is, that destructs me so much about that new Picard series. Maybe it is the really bad Alex Kurtzman script writing, the Jar Jar Abremesque directing or the simple fact that Star Trek Picard is becoming a Game of Thrones kind of game. Every scene is painted in a over dramatic manor. Every scene wants to be overwhelming, wants to catch the audience emotionaly, just wants to be to much of everything. But foremost it want\u00c2\u00b4s to change the charecter of a rational thinking, brillant Star Fleet captain\/addmiral into a emotional acting tattering old man, totally ingnoring a life time of responsible serving as a captain and an admiral. The most sad part is that it\u00c2\u00b4s getting worst and worst from episode to episode. Man I loved Sir Patrick playing Picard in TNG but I start to realy dislike him for playing in that stupid little series, full of darkness and violance called ST:Picard. This series has nothing and I mean absolutly nothing to do with Star Trek. It\u00c2\u00b4s just labeled with it.Gosh, maybe I\u00c2\u00b4m getting to old to enjoy the new Star Trek that it has unfortionaly become. Jar Jar and Kurtzman changed the whole game. Star Trek isn\u00c2\u00b4t about science, exploring and growing as mankind anymore. It has just became stupid. I guess that Gene Roddenberry is already turning in his grave.Also some of the reviews telling Trekster and Trekkis that this is not our Star Trek and we have to take it the way it is. I Say that Star Trek is nothing without it\u00c2\u00b4s fans and supporters. Without the guys who spending tons of time, passion and money (sometimes trevelling around the globe) to visit ST conventions in costumes and living their passion. We need to show CBS that we the fans are the ones who decide about what Star Trek should be and avoiding to watch every ST series that is already aired or will be aired in the future on CBS.","rating":"1\/10","date":"15 March 2020"}

{"title":"Disappointing for real Star Trek fans","review":"Dear Mister Kurtzman,you unfortunately absolutely didn't catch what the original Star Trek was about: it's a positive vision of the future - a utopia, not a dystopia! It was about morality, ehtical questions, logic, how to handle problems with several cultural encounters. It was science fiction, not science fantasy - with real scientific questions, and nevertheless exciting for everyone.\nThe Hollywood-stereo-typical reckless characters you've created instead of honorable Star Fleet Captains and also Federation Officers, the sudden existence of money (back to former capitalism?), unlogical complots within the Star Fleet, or a Picard who isn't even questioning the daredevils besides him who are taking revenge by senceless murdering of opponents for example, is just the tip of the iceberg. You messed it up.\nAre you even wondering why sooo many Star Trek fans are so disappointed? Look what amazing projects the fans created from their own! The existing fan movies are all about what was so important in the old Star Trek - the things I wrote up here - they always tried hard to rebuild the logic of that universe - which you totally misunderstood in my opinion! I'm still hoping that this is not the end of this beautiful universe which Gene once created. But I'm afraid it is.\nAs long as that stays that bad like it is, I prefer to stick to The Orville, that's way more Star Trek than this is.","rating":"4\/10","date":"5 May 2020"}

{"title":"Picard Is Back?","review":"A lot of these 10\/10 scores share the same phrases, like: Picard is back! I've wondered if studios create bogus reviews for IMDB and other review sites... I suspect they do.Picard is old and feeble. Maybe they have him that way to contrast the difference between the (from previews, not a spoiler) retired Picard and the Picard that returns to space. Of course Patrick Stewart is about to turn 80, so I shouldn't expect him to do much outside of talking and saying, \"engage.\" When a group of bad guys appear in episode one, Picard mostly stands around while a young girl does all the butt-kicking. It feels odd seeing the main protagonist watching the fight and not backing up others.Of course, this was only the first episode - it certainly has potential to get better. My \"3\" is a bit low, it's more of a 5 or 6. Seeing all the 10\/10 reviews written like they came from a studio marketing department is annoying. Critic reviews are not reliable - they can be bitter and unable to appreciate fun shows. I count on the \"regular people\" reviews when deciding what to watch. If they start filling up with artificially high reviews from some marketing department I have one less reliable source when looking for a good show to watch.","rating":"3\/10","date":"24 January 2020"}

I wont bore you with details as MANY users have already explained them more eloquently than I could, all Ill say is; as a Star Trek fan - hell, as a fan of compelling entertainment - I was utterly disappointed.Thankfully I wont have to despair that Star Trek is dead (and it is dead) because The Orville has supplanted it completely.Don't watch this show if your a fan of entertainment.","rating":"2\/10","date":"26 March 2020"}

Style and CGI effects good....However I could not enjoy the show without the jarring Fbombs  profanity added to the episodes to artificially \"pun intended\" attempt to make the series more seem more modern and edgy. I understand that science fiction is really about mans attempt to become God or godlike through advances in technology...but just seems interesting that if the narrative is there is no god but man....there sure has been a trend in the last 5-10yrs of movies\/TV movies...of the effort to use of Gods name in vain when they want to curse and\/or punctuate anger. Maybe it might be me because as I have matured and understand that there is a consequence to using Gods name in vain when expressing anger....but I mean it really it was jarring...I lost count after the 3rd GD and 5fth Fbomb. Also the \"assumed\" scene and references did absolutely nothing but made the series unsuitable for under 18. I enjoyed original Star Trek, NG, and other series as preteen\/teen as it sparked my interest in science and technology...and all the shows had some morals and wisdom added to them which is why so many people enjoyed them. However I would not allow a pre-teen\/teen watch this.I would have stopped watching but as we all know its very hard to stop in the middle of a binge watch even if the show is bad (hard to stop watching a train wreck as its happening). To sum up this was a TV R rating Star Trek series with rise of the machines like plot with only saving grace attempt at the end with what feels like was bolted on human spirit morale lesson in attempt to connect to the original STNG series.I should have passed...but took one for the team so you don't have to.

{"title":"For Star trek, very poor.","review":"I am not a treckie, treckie but am a fan of Star Trek since Capt Kirk's days. Loved all the series, ST, ST Next Gen, DS 9, Voyager, Enterprise(Loved it) and even Discovery(kinda) which I think apart from Picard is the worst of them. Very little of a Sc-Fi nature really happens in Picard imo or not enough. The story starts ok but soon deteriorates into a silly mess. They throw in the likes of J. Frakes, Mirana Sertis and Brent Spiner but their roles are too little too late. By half way you do not really care about the characters and it just does not go anywhere. I thought 7 of 9 was the best of a bad lot.Update - Season 2\nStarts off well enough but this is the Flag ship of the Federation supposedly manned by the best the federation has to offer but the security team cannot even obey a simple order from the Captain as in \"Cease Fire\" not that he even gave them the order to fire in the first place. It is this lack of attention to detail or just plain disregarding what the crew of the ship is supposed to represent, cool heads under pressure. They do this so they can destroy everything and Introduce Q into the series with a \"I told you so\" mantra.","rating":"3\/10","date":"29 March 2020"}

{"title":"Gave up after 5 episodes","review":"Struggled through five episodes out of nostalgia for ST: TNG and the TNG movies before giving up. This isn't Star Trek. This isn't Jean-Luc Picard, either.Almost every character here treats Picard the way the Simpsons treat Grandpa Simpson -- like a senile, doddering old fool who should only sit in the corner and not say anything unless he wants to be talked down to.I watched a few old TNG episodes last week by chance, then watched this mess again. Wow, the difference. The Jean-Luc Picard we all know from TNG had dignity, strength of character, and commanded respect. In TNG, he stood up to Romulans, Klingons, survived Cardasian torture with strength of will, stuck it to the Shelliac when he found a loophole in the contract they had with the Federation to save the day, etc.ST: Picard's 'Picard' is not that guy. Here he only seems to be there to be talked down to and disrespected by everyone around him except for the Elf warrior that follows him around -- whose sword skills are somehow vital for his protection in a world where the primary weapons are phasers fired at a distance at you.Character wise, Picard is only Picard in name. Jean-Luc Picard naming his dog 'Number 1'? Cheap writer gag that got some 'ha ha' from someone in the writing room, but there's no way Jean-Luc Picard would ever do that -- he'd consider it tasteless. Raffi calling him 'JL' all the time? The old Picard would have corrected that in a hurry on the deck of the Enterprise.The only positives are the small references to and cameos with the old TNG cast (not surprisingly). This show is all plot holes, logic gaps, unlikeable characters, revisionist history to ST canon, and Romulans that look like regular humans who went to the dollar store to buy pointy ears. The one on the Borg cube in particular looks like a cosplay actor with a bad wig.The toss in swearing here and there is a really out of place and a cringy way for the show to pretend it's 'edgy' but it just comes across as feeling out of place and uncomfortable.In the end, this show has nothing to do with actual Star Trek. They've even had Picard say he doesn't much like science fiction or understand technology lol.....the former Captain of the Enterprise, whose starship flew all over the galaxy and used his ship's resources himself without a problem many times. These lines actually got green lit to put on screen.Season 3 of The Orville is coming back soon. Looking forward to it. Yes, it's a bit more humor laden and a touch cheesier at times, but it's easily a hundred times more Star Trek than this.","rating":"1\/10","date":"22 March 2020"}

{"title":"Picard isn't about... Picard.","review":"Of course in 2020 Picard can't be about Picard. Instead it has to be about a strong,  superhero woman. Just like pretty much everything else that's out right now. It would have been mediocre at best if episode one was self-contained, but having now seen the ending it's apparent this is going to be a thing for the foreseeable future. Is this all Hollywood knows how to do now? Yes. The answer's yes.This episode plays like a checklist of \"woken\" politics. I can imagine that at the writer's table they were repulsed by the idea of the show being lead by an old, white, straight male. So they quickly shoehorned in a plot involving a strong female minority who could beat up men with one arm behind her back, so that their fears of loosing half their millennial audiences would be quelched. You can see that at the very least they felt they needed to start the season off that way, so that later if and when it does revolve around Picard, at least they already hooked their supposed fan base.Next up, identity politics, where it wouldn't surprise me if we learn that Data's daughter was born male.

It's a mishmash of bunch of scifi franchises such as Ghost in the Shell, Firefly, Red Faction, ST films based on Kelvin timeline, etc. The legacy should have been left alone and not tempered with. They should have reframed the story by saying that this story happens in yet another alternate ST universe. The scriptwriting is not great and the story feels very forced to make an unlikely connection between the TNG and this series. While I forgive the fact that the space ships and their interior don't appear very \"Star Trek,\" they do appear to look like they were borrowed from other low-budget scifi franchises. The special FX on the other hand look abysmal and outdated. After episode 3, I had to stop watching.

That was embarrassing.And then there was the wokeness ... the statutory kick-ass female et al.As for Picard: he appears to have been embalmed and, subsequently - only partially - re-animated.The script was turgid, and the pacing snail-like.

And what dreadful pacing! The entire show had only two truly engaging episodes (the first one and The Impossible Box), the rest was shoozfest.And whats with this new tendency to take beloved old characters that had their happy-ednings in their own tv shows or movies and turning then into these bitter and hollow shells of their old selves?\nWe've seen it done recently with Luke, Han and Leia in Star Wars, and now it Star Trek's turn it seems...I'm talking about Seven of Nine, of course. Instead of being happily married to Chakotay, she is now some sort of space mercinary and a lesbian too. And so that Seven would be completely and totally miserable they brutally killed Icheb as well.Some of the new characters were promising though - I think Rios, Soji, Elnor and Narek would have shined in the old style Star Trek series.As it is though, it's a mess - boring, tedious mess.","rating":"4\/10","date":"24 April 2020"}

{"title":"Star Trek as we knew it is dead. I guess times and audiences change. At least it's better than Discovery.","review":"I was hoping that we would get a return to what made Star Trek, well, Star Trek. I thought maybe TPTB learned something from the backlash to Discovery.It's better than Discovery, but this isn't a show about exploring the stars and the sense of wonder that brings with it. It's not even science fiction at all. It's a straight-up drama with a Star Trek theme. The only trick they have up their sleeve is bringing back an aging Patrick Stewart. Don't let that fool you into thinking it's a great show. He plays his role as written here well, don't get me wrong. In fact, he turns in an excellent performance, but that alone still doesn't make this Star Trek.It's one of the reasons I didn't really care much for DS9. It was too much drama, not enough space exploration. Then they returned to form with Voyager and Enterprise.The other problem is that every single scene is trying so hard to be as dramatic as possible. I've noticed this is a trend in recent years in many shows, I think they're trying to make sure you stay super-engaged so that you keep binge watching, but it's just kind of tiring when everything is full-throttle all the time.This isn't Star Trek. I grew up on The Next Generation. Maybe I'm getting old and the times have passed me by. I'm only 35, but I mean, maybe.I wrote off Discovery as a misstep that they would learn from, and was eagerly awaiting Picard, but now it's clear. Star Trek, as those of us who have been watching for decades knew it, is dead. RIP.

This is nothing but a giant, desperate virtue signal. If you asked a 16 year old to take all the time they need to write an entire script for a Picard season, they'd do a better job than this.

A little slow to build but that's to be expected to set up the story line. HOWEVER, after Picard sits down with the Admiral in episode 2 and she drops the F bomb--with my 4, 8 and 11 year old watching--I was turned off. The M rating is one reason why I'm not interested in Trek Discovery and for some reason the producers seem to think an M rating will result in better ratings? Not for me and my house. If they cleaned things up a bit to give it a TV14 rating I could give this an 8 star rating. But watching a Trek show shouldn't be like watching sailors talk. This only distracts from the show and it's sad that they've decided to go this route for such a once great franchise. Picard himself even looks a little out of place with the Admiral's remark. You would never see him speak that course in any previous Trek. Sad.","rating":"4\/10","date":"6 February 2020"}

{"title":"Terribly Written Star Trek","review":"I'm staggered by how bad the writing is in Picard. These people are paid to write for a living and they come up with... this?I've seen many Trek fans attack Picard for trying to be too edgy; for the swearing, and the gore and violence. That stuff actually didn't bother me. If used appropriately it could be of great benefit to the franchise (for example discovering an alien race that's so brutally violent that it's a level above any other race previously encountered, the gore being used to emphasise this).No, those things were neither here nor there. I was far more insulted by them constantly bringing back beloved Trek characters only to kill them off, often in the space of a single episode. That seriously pi**ed me off. It happens three times in ten episodes!Another major problem: the key story arc is boring. This is a huge issue, because Picard is a serial tv\/web show. Trek has some fantastic story arcs, from the Dominion to the Xindi. And even some that had fantastic potential but which were under-utilised (Voyager's journey home, which could and should have been more serialised, like a several season long version of the two-part episode Year of Hell). The story arc in Picard was neither well executed nor did it have great potential from the outset. There is some brief potential towards the end, when the prospect of an incredibly powerful race of evolved synths look set to invade Sar Fleet space, but it's quickly cut off.Yet another major problem: the new 'crew' are almost to a person completely unlikable. None of them are charismatic, none of them interesting, even the emergency holos are cringe-inducing. If they all died in the opener of season 2 I'd be happy - at least with a reset crew there's a chance one of them would be worth investing in.Plot holes galore, characters constantly making stupid decisions, Romulans now look and act pretty much like humans, cliched sequences of events you can see coming from a mile off, and actions not having approriate consequences. A member of the crew somehow manages to commit murder, is told she'll be turned over to Star Fleet, isn't, and then it's never mentioned again - at the end of the final episode she stands on the bridge with the rest of the crew as if all has been forgotten and forgiven.The more I think back on the season the more disappointed I become - I'm starting to question if a 4 is too high for this dross.So let's see, what are the upsides? Well, at least it's more sci-fi television, and I can't get enough of sci-fi, and specifically it's more Trek. So that's good, even if it has been somewhat butchered.It's good to see Seven again... I guess. My second favourite character from Voyager, I was expecting to enjoy her return more than I did. She's changed a lot, but I guess that can be put down to her personality and 'humanity', now more jaded, developing a lot in the time since Voyager returned to Earth. But is that really why her character is so different? Or is it just that the writers have changed her to suit their own ends, and there's actually no reasoning or thought behind her personality changes at all. It's hard to say.Seven in Voyager was a subtlely kick ass character, a deadly machine almost, hidden behind a mask of Borg stoicism. In Picard it's more a case of an outwardly kick ass character - like the only way the writers were able to portray how strong she is is by turning her into some sort of grizzled street fighter and gun for hire. 'Look guys, strong female character; she can even carry two phasers!'. I'll take Seven from Voyager any day over that sort of childish attempt at fan service.Season one is basically a Trek series with bad writing and a completely unlikable cast of characters. The latter we're pretty much stuck with, but there's always hope the writing and story arc for season 2 will be much improved. It needs to be.","rating":"3\/10","date":"8 April 2020"}

The writing is sub par and lacks any realism or soul. The story is just depressing, dark and violent. The only reason it's not rated lower by me is that the visual effects are really good.This definitely is following the \"Wokeism\" of Hollywood where Women are good and the bestest ever, and all men who came before them in Star Trek will be dragged throught he mud, humiliated and destroyed.

This switch from utopian to dystopian future is devastating and the only anchor with the viewer left, is a nostalgia for Picard as we remember him from ST Generations.\nWhen it was announced, I was really excited that after disappointing ST Discovery a true Star Trek will return.

{"title":"Really, there are better things to do with your time","review":"Like some of the other reviewers I really wanted to like this. I don't find The Next Generation to be great, certainly not Original Series great, but I find it tolerably OK and I watch it when there's nothing else on to attract my attention.This show is a train wreck. The characters are for the most part, flat and dull, and worse they make no sense. Musiker, for instance, hates Picard when we first see her. She threatens to kill him. Suddenly, everything is OK and she's willing to Trek along with him. Jurati goes crazy, kills a man, then all is forgiven.The only character who is truly endearing is Riker's and Troi's daughter. The actress is charming and natural, and her scenes with Soji are the high point of the show, although that's a sadly low target to set.The story, such as it is, is similarly pointless. Picard et al rush to some location to get a clue to solving their mystery, which sets them toward rushing to another location to get another chunk. We're given information that's supposed to make us care about them, but it rings hollow. Musiker, again, is supposed to hate Picard, holding him responsible for the end of her Star Fleet career. She doesn't seem particularly committed to here ideals, however.Then there are the tons of characters who have no real point at all in the story, although they suck up a lot of screen time. Of them all, 7 of 9 is probably the worst. She's another tortured person (there are a ton of them), but the reasons why are vague, and it's OK because, like all the rest, she's happy at the end. There are a pair of Romulans who appear to be Picard's servants, but who also appear to be trained operatives, who...just disappear. Then there are a ton of ex-Borg including our old friend Hugh, who...just disappear, although at least he dies, so we understand his disappearance.And what does all this lead to? A conclusion which I believe is supposed to make us feel good. It's composed of two primary elements. In the first, Soji is ready to give up on all corporeal life in the Milky Way galaxy. She requires very little convincing to support this course of action. She's just ready to kill us all. And then, she's not. Changed her mind. Why? It's a girl's prerogative.In the second element, Picard dies. After a brief dialog between his \"spirit\" and Data's \"spirit,\" he's back. Those responsible go to great lengths to explain that, while he's been resurrected in an android body, he's just like he was before. He has his own soul, his body will wear out, he will die, etc. In other words, he's died, and nothing has changed.Granted, Star Trek has been on a long downhill slope for decades, but this is the bottom of the barrel.","rating":"2\/10","date":"9 August 2020"}
{"title":"What a letdown","review":"Lately, Star Trek as a franchise has been increasingly disappointing. Simon Pegg, who passed himself off as something of an expert in all things Trek, foisted off Star Trek Beyond on an unsuspecting public, complete with Fast and Furious director Justin Lin's Fast and Trekious. An upcoming franchise entry promises to have a gang of teenagers finding a wrecked starship a la Scooby Doo. Lower Decks promises to make Trek funny.And then there's Picard. Picard was a major letdown. The story, such as it is, is a mostly meaningless mess, with perhaps 3 episodes worth of plat stretched out to 11 episodes. How did they manage that? Well, there's the episode with Picard in a zoot suit on the crime syndicate planet (stop laughing, I'm serious). There's tons of material with Borg and Romulans which has no bearing whatsoever on the main plot (such as it is) or the season's conclusion.And about that conclusion. There's an attitude around current Trek, on full display in Picard. I can best describe it in an online conversation I had with a fan, when I pointed out that the show was incredibly fluffy and light on story. The response was \"But Picard is now sooooo woke!\" as if that in and of itself was sufficient.So surely the characters make up for the lack of story, right? Uh huh. First, Picard himself is a shell of his former self. This would be OK if the show explored this development, but it really doesn't. It has Picard morosely feeling disappointed in former life choices (and be warned, everything in this show is morose) but it doesn't address his aging. At the same time, whenever there's action, it's hard to escape the feeling that the actors around Stewart are fearful of breaking him.Few of the other characters come off any better. Agnes Jurati comes off as incredibly neurotic, even before she's subjected to a Vulcan-style mind meld which may have completely compromised her. She kills a man who may have been her lover, becomes deranged...then everything is OK, and all is forgiven. No, strike that. All is NOT EVEN mentioned.For Voyager 7 of 9 kills someone who may have been her former lover. She's morose throughout the episode, but she's smiling by the end, even though the thing which apparently apparently made her morose has had no resolution.Rafi Musiker is apparently meant to be a third major character. When introduced, she hates Picard enough to threaten to kill him. But she changes her mind (because the script requires her to do so), and by the end, she's smiling along with everyone else.And Picard? He has the best ending of all. He dies, and then after a short scene he is brought back as an android. There follows an explanation that nothing will have changed for him. He can still be killed, and he will still grow old and die, yadda yadda yadda. I'm tempted to say that he died because the episode was running short, but I think the truth is that Stewart wanted a death scene.Is the show completely worthless? Almost...but not quite. The Doj and Soji characters have something of an interesting (yet rushed; not to producers, less Borg and Romulans, less traipsing around in search of clues, more character development). Riker and Troi are back, and unlike their former Captain they have character development and it's believable. They also have a daughter who steals the show, and scenes with her and Soji are the season's best.Is that enough to make it worthwhile to watch the show? For me, Picard is ten hours of my life that I can't get back. I would have to be paid a lot to get me to watch any more of this drivel.","rating":"2\/10","date":"23 September 2020"}

Production can only fool so many people.Picard makes a mockery of past characters by shoehorning them in a logic defying action adventure that loosely stitches together previous Star Trek content.Picard comes off as a lazy producer's idea of what will sell to Star Trek fans. Really this project is more aimed at fans of brainless action fantasy - into the realm of contemporary comic book movies. I say that because Picard makes up science as it goes for convenient story devices, and in the process ignores previous Star Trek world rules, and logic.I admit Picard is watchable. It maintains continuity. Characters are built, develop and change - It isn't like Picard is devoid of content - or that it isn't occasionally entertaining with special effects or action sets. If watched for light entertainment, without a deeper look, one might think this is above average.But this is Star Trek. It should be watched close. It should live up to a standard set by Gene Roddenberry.

Where is that Federation spirit?I knew going in that things will be different, after all this a new show after so many years. But I was not prepared how much they will change things; how many things will be simply reworked without ever explaining why.The future that StarTrek: Picard is showing is not so much a future as a reference to the here and now.

{"title":"\"..It's Trek,Jim!.. but not as we knew it!..\"...","review":"So I had read the terrible reviews of season one, but I got an HMV voucher and spent it on the first season..... they were not wrong... from the moment that the hatchet faced female Federation Admiral spat at the legendary Jean Luc about \"...Sheer fxxxxxg Hubris!!!...\", I thought, what the hell am I watching here?, I persevered and found it very very depressing. Equally depressing was watching Patrick Stewart, pretending to be young again, and I can only imagine how much money he got to reprise his classic, best known role. I suppose there was a bit of enjoyment in seeing seven of nine again, and I have always liked the musketeer fella, until he to started dropping F-Bombs. Sooo bad. Season two started off even worse, and I nearly gipped when the attractive Romulan housekeeper, Larris went in for a smooch with the geriatric Jean-Luc,(.. I was reminded of the late Anna Nicole Smith, and her billionaire,mummified husband, not a very edifying sight...). Then we had a totally predictable plot instigated by the,(.. admittedly, always fun...),Q, punctuated, with lazy digs at white people and capitalism,(.. the future evil 'Confederation'..), about a subtle as a hammer to your finger. They try to pull it back with season three, and I had read good things and It nearly fooled me, for a few minutes, but when it was over and I thought back over all the three seasons, I quickly came to the conclusion that it was a horrible cynical cash grab. So many questions, unanswered, like at the end of season two, I thought they were friendly with the Borg so how did they come to be the baddies in season three?. They gave Jean-Luc a new body, so why not give him a younger one so we could get around a little bit faster?. Season three also reminded me of other films where they seemed to pinch wholesale visuals and even dialogue, most notably return of the Jedi and aliens. So to summarise, I found the whole thing very very bad and I sincerely hope they do no more, but I suppose they will. I gave it two stars and they were for the effects which were pretty damn good throughout. Message to Star Trek makers.... Please stop... just leave us with our happy memories.

{"title":"A side of ST that I would rather not see.","review":"I noticed continuity error that has contaminated the entire series: the foul language. In Star Trek IV: Voyage Home, Spock and Kirk struggle with the \"colorful metaphors\" on earth in the 20th century. Kirk reveals that \"nobody will pay attention to you unless you swear every other word\". The writers in Star Trek: Picard apparently forgot that we had left those \"colorful metaphors\" behind several centuries because Star Trek: Picard is beyond \"laced with colorful metaphors\". The language takes the fun out of the series and limits it to adults only viewership. And it is just boring.","rating":"5\/10","date":"28 March 2020"}

It is a little interesting but is loosing me. Anticipation may have been it's biggest fall.My biggest issue with the axing is Michelle Hurd. Normally a good actress , is over acting in playing her roll that it is a character rather than a character.

{"title":"Star Trek in name only","review":"I grew up on Star Trek i watched STNG on BBC2 every Wednesday at 6pm in the early 90s. I use to have reoccurring dreams that I was on the bridge of the Enterprise D with the crew. I thought I would try and recapture my youth and watch this new series. However this series is disappointing dross. It has no magic or story lines I loved data and Geordi but I did not think much of the new characters. Vaping & drinking addicts! dissing captain Picard JL! who are you bob you no namer. No way would Captain Picard take this back in the day not from miss vapor meth! Now Picard is a hen pecked stooge. The only reason I carried on watching this was to see Data and Picard but JL is gone now anyway. The synth like the show is just a hollow copy. I can't believe that they killed data off again. He could have easily had a new body made. I guess this is the powers that be saying this is our trek now. Hollywood's leftie politics has ruined this shows potential.","rating":"1\/10","date":"6 April 2020"}

To make things even worse everything the producers try to sell us as a expanded or newly envisioned Star Trek is galaxies away from being inventive or creative - all this dystopian blabla (not that I don't like well made dystopian movies or shows from time to time) we get felt in every other sci-fi show or movie these days.

The writing is awful. Throwing in random cuss words and having characters call Picard \"JL\" doesn't make it feel fresh or hip or whatever they were going for... episodes barely feel like episodes at all and seem to just end at random... the editing is utterly laughable, they jump back and forth in time nonsensically and replay things we've already seen for no reason... the whole plot is basically just Blade Runner... the characters are boring and underdeveloped... the android and that Romulan dude meet for the first time at the end of episode one, and in their VERY NEXT SCENE they're already bedfellows... every scene on the Borg cube with these characters is utter cringe... this \"show\" is beyond pathetic. It's actually quite sad.

{"title":"Incomprehensible. Will make your brain hurt.","review":"I suppose my problem is less about a dark vision of the future and more with the fact that the story itself is nearly incomprehensible. They come up with this strange idea that Data had an actual brother , that is the biological son of Noonian Soong. There is no evidence of that in the prior canon. Plus they bring back 7 of 9, who is a great great character, and it's not at all clear what she's doing, and the plot that concerns her seems to exist sort of in a back room with no relevant connection to the main plot. The main plot is extremely confusing and has something to do with androids\/AI becoming violent and destructive while at the same time some intolerant forces have banned androids, and this is seen as evil even though the androids were im fact violent and destructive.And commander riker and counselor Troy had a child who died of an illness which would have been prevented if they didn't banned artificial intelligence because artificial intelligence had some sort of a cure for that disease.If you are not enjoying my review I assure you you will not enjoy the show because my review is just as in comprehensible as this terrible terrible program.And there is some bizarre romulan spy who is involved in doing research on a Borg cube (??) who has a evil sister, and they're trying to kill and artificial life form , whom captain picard is trying to save, even though she IS in fact the destroyer of the Galaxy that everyone fears she is.....\nI think I only wanted to write this review to see if I could try in a few minutes to make some sense of these 10 episodes.

{"title":"Children could write a better story","review":"Too many missed oportunitys. It's so cringe sometimes I just turn off the TV. It's not the actors, but the incredible bad writing. This series seems like it was written by a teenager who forgot to study for a class test and viewed a 5-minute summary on the topic shortly before the test. Our beloved characters behave nothing like before, and the new ones seem extremely incompetent. Like Raffi, who is just too emotional to be a starfleet captain.There are a few good ideas, but not more.And about the special effects:It doesn't look like Star Trek. The new Star Wars shows have great CGI that looks like the old Star Wars, but in Picard, it's just bad. To top it off, the copy-paste fleet at the end of season 1 is nothing but a joke.In sum, these series existing is worse than not having it.","rating":"3\/10","date":"15 February 2023"}

Shallow storylines, stupid characters, slow, boring, really really boring, just astonishingly boring, cringingly woke, nihilistic, a slap in the face to all the Star Trek that came before.

{"title":"Not sure the writers have watched Star Trek before.","review":"I watched the first episode. Simple writing, simple plot. There are major deviations from established Star Trek. The Federation now watches TV, even though as a form of entertainment it did not last long after 2040. Data's daughter,Lal, is not mentioned, lots of action, not thought provoking. Feels like a rip off of Blade Runner and Firefly.\nFour stars because Patrick Stewart is a good actor, the special effects are good, and it has a good score.","rating":"4\/10","date":"5 February 2020"}

This program was too slow and tried to tap into too much of modern politics and rather depressing. With a boring storyline and a cast that you can't build a connection with it's hard to pay attention, the recap at the start of the episode is actually needed as I couldnt remember if I fell asleep at the end of the previous episode.

{"title":"Could barely go through a few episodes from series 1","review":"Frankly, I don't even know to point out what is wrong with it. For as much (or as little), as I could watch before my interest completely vanished, it seemed that Picard had no other strong character to counter-balance him. The plot was already weaving too many things into the first episodes, only to slow down aftwrwards, and the other characters were more like a chorus to Picard the Man.Probably the actor has too big of a personality and ego, not to speak of his status, that this one man show just spinned away from a rounded, full featured series.Take it more like an impression, if you will, since the whole series is still unfolding. Whatever. It will be a while until I will dare try it again, if ever. Just better keep the Next Generation Picard in mind, where he was completed by Riker and the rest of the crew. It was less stiff, less vague, less un-compelling, that one.","rating":"3\/10","date":"16 April 2022"}

In writing, people work their whole lives figuring out interesting ways to show the reader whats happening instead of telling them through tedious exposition.

{"title":"He lived long and prospered, once upon a time.","review":"Within a few minutes of S2 E1, I grabbed my phone & Google Patrick Stewart health.Then I went back to watching the show and was sad for him, and angry that they went ahead with Season 2. What I saw was akin to elder abuse. Picard could barely stand in some scenes, and his voice often.too weak to understand. Patrick Stewart is a dedicated professional with a strong work ethic. But at some point, all elders need guidance and protection from the world and the monsters in it. Stewart was taken advantage of in his weakened state, IMO. No one stopped it. Even if he is the one who demanded the show must go on, someone should have kindly refused him.I have the utmost respect for the honorable Patrick Stewart. Paramount? Zero.

{"title":"Season one was worth it for the nostalgia trip, season two isn't worth it at all","review":"I get that film-making has changed in the last ~30 years, I get it that due to the intellectual property voodoo ST has had to get a \"different\" look and feel to everything up to Enterprise. I get we can put more pew-pew now in each episode. I get it that the show needs to evolve, season-long story arcs feel more \"serious\" than \"dilemma of the week\". That's fine, evolve away. But who is this show even for?If it's for the existing fans of the ST series, then the makers should take into account that those fans have grown older so ST should become more sophisticated to keep up, not come up with plots seemingly written by 6-graders and cover the silliness up with technobabble. Same as other reviews have noted, ST didn't used to be about solving problems with weapons and kicks.If the show is oriented towards capturing a new young adult audience, then why bother bringing back Patrick Stewart and the gang? Season one was ok as a nostalgia trip, one last hurrah for the ST: NG crew. A gentle last goodbye.Season two... ugh... gets sillier by the episode. Although the scenes with Picard either have better-written dialogues or Patrick Stewart's delivery can make any nonsense sound wise. I choose to believe that he's actually had some degree of creative control over his own lines and that's why his scenes are actually mostly quite enjoyable.S02 starts with the \"Don't step on butterflies\" principle of time travel but ends up with \"this was always supposed to happen\". WTH...Last but not least, while I like the character of Rios, his obsession with smoking is jarring. I can swallow it when he's on his own ship. But as a captain of a Starfleet starship, he's on the bridge with a cigar in his teeth? I think that level of inconsideration toward his officers would be unacceptable in Starfleet. But we never actually see him smoking. My suspicion is that's because because showing someone smoking would have changed the age rating of the show. But we do want all those sweet-sweet tobacco dollars! So what do we do then? Make it suggestive AF without actually showing it, so he holds the cigar in his mouth, plays around with the lighter, later - with matches but never actually smokes on-screen. Even supposedly dies \"smoking a cigar\". Whoopy Goldberg must have gagged when saying the line.Conclusion: If you're an existing ST fan, Orville has more ST spirit in it than Picard. Go watch that.If you're not an existing ST fan, skip it. Why would you waste your time on a dying franchise?","rating":"4\/10","date":"19 July 2022"}

The greatest captain and the very essence of what gene wanted to express.\nSadly they played their ace but it wasn't how we remember him. Picard is a mess of boring characters with even more boring stories. Gone is the feeling of hope, exploration and wonder. Replaced with division, hate and boredom.\nI echo what many have said in their reviews previously, star trek truly is dead.

{"title":"YA level mediocrity","review":"Picard is a mess. Star Trek originally was about morals, values, exploration, and the crew using their wits to solve a problem. There was a clear beginning, middle, and end, yet this series doesn't even come close to it. This series is more like cringeworthy young adult garbage- something like Thirsty by M.T. Andreson.We start out in Picard's vineyard, like the one we see in All Good Things. Then it switches to a girl whose boyfriend is shot by some guys wearing masks. Then switch back to Picard, who is making a speech about how the Federation made a mistake with the synthetic ban. HOLD THE PHONE! This isn't Star Trek, we already have too much exposition. Who is this girl? Why did the Federation ban synthetics?I'm going to skip over everything here. There is no logical reason for the Federation to ban synths for a single mars attack, and then drop everything. It doesn't make sense, and the only reason this sort of thing exists is to force the show to go down a dystopian world, where there is a certain group of people who are an \"enemy of the state\", and that one of the main characters fits under that category.Honestly that is a very sloppy sort of plotline that has been done to death. Look at Detroit: Become Human, or Thirsty by M.T. Anderson, the Cirque du Freak series by Darren Shan, hell even Undertale. This type of trope where one person is part of a certain ethnic group that the government sees as evil, is quite frankly bloated out of control. It is an attempt to give the main characters a sense of dread, hopelessness, and a demand for change, all the while trying to hide one's self, and run away.Take away the Star Trek name, rename all the characters, change the uniforms and the organizations, and it is a pretty shallow series. Sure, there is some development, but the series tries too many things at once. It is hard to keep track of honestly, because there are so many things going on at once. The androids wanting to do a revolution and wipe out humanity, alright that seems like a good idea, but then the whole thing was just dropped. This sort of reminds me of the Last Jedi, where snoke was killed just to progress the plot. Like, seriously?There is no real tension, there is no suspense, or well very little of it. The twist of the androids wanting to wipe out humanity and all life was ruined by the fact that the romulans were going to wipe them out, blah blah blah. It's just hard to keep track of the plot.All in all, this season was just a mess. It was nice to see Picard, and I enjoyed it at first glance, but looking back, it just doesn't feel like star trek. The Federation is evil, the Romulans are evil, and so many other things. A shameful attempt to make a dystopian tv show ripping off the Star Trek brand. It's just tiring. There is no real structure to this story.","rating":"4\/10","date":"1 July 2020"}

Before the series aired I knew it was about Picard in his latter years, but having said that as a Treckie, I was really hoping it would have that TNG feeling but sadly it didn't.\nI watched the whole of series 1 and felt let down buy the script, most of the characters and to some extent Patrick Stewart himself.\nI am not sure whether he was supposed to act as a really old man or not, I thought the Picard character was never forceful enough. One scene where something happened on this ship, he said \"what do we do now?\", this is Picard we're talking about! Another issue I had was with the bad language, was it really necessary?\nThe ship 'La Sirena' command deck IMO was bland and had no character, it looked like they were in a warehouse!\nTechnology had moved on since Picard was last on the Enterprise but it should not have moved on that fast, even the Tricorder was obsolete!\nThe 2nd series is coming, I really hope the script writers get their act together for this and bring back some favorites!","rating":"3\/10","date":"9 August 2020"}

A great potential story was completely left out, and just added in as \"history,\" while the storyline we're left to watch is bland, boring, messy, and just confusing. We see the great captain Picard left in shambles, with no way of redeeming himself.The non-story elements also don't make sense. Why were the romulans changed? They look so different that the only thing still \"romulan\" about them is their name. Also flying cars cliche, everyone knows that's never gonna happen. And don't forget, holograms everywhere.

I enjoyed seeing Patrick Stewart in this role again and I felt all the nostalgia I was supposed to feel. Unfortunately, the end result is pretty disapointing. While I was never bored watching it, it felt to me like they took way too long in the middle to tell way too little story. Because of that, last two episodes felt rushed. They used technology to try and solve the problems with how they'd written the story. Also the final reveals with what they did to Picard didn't work at all for me. I really did enjoy going back to this world and spending time with Jean-Luc Picard and seeing where the Federation was at. But the specific story they chose felt very flat and a lot of writing was lazy. It breaks my heart to say this, but I can't recommend it.","rating":"5\/10","date":"31 March 2020"}

As a sci-fi fan, I also like Star Trek movies and series ( I grew up watching the original series reruns on tv) and it certainly has a very important place in my heart. But I'm a Star Wars fan, and as so, I really don't know or have much knowledge about Star Trek lore. I know what most people know... captain Kirk, Spock, the Entreprise adventures, some main antagonists like romulans, klingons and KAHNNNNN!, all the spin-off series, those red shirt dudes who are meant to die...\nDue to that fact, I was not sure what to expect regarding \"Picard\". What I know is that Star Trek: Discovery was a total flop. Weak script, weak characters, dumb klingons... while Star Trek New Generation, in the other hand, was a huge success and Jean-Luc Picard is considered among the greatest capitains ever in ST universe (In my opinion better than Kirk, who is a wrecking train, despite all his courage).\nSo, I was becoming more and more eager to watch Picard. First ep is awesome, Data shows up, there's action, good fighting scenes... and a promising plot. But as the series develops, it becomes dull and low paced. I really like Patrick Stewart as Picard, but Picard isn't working that nice as an octagenary, mainly in fighting scenes. it simply makes no sense... writers should have come with a better idea to improve those moments.\nDialogues are very dumb in severeal scenes. Some decisions are plain pointless. I quit watching after some episodes.\nNothing against Mr. Patrick Stewart, a honed actor.

And still, actress Madeline Wise, playing the role of Yvette Picard - who judging by her first name is supposed to be French as well - says \"John, look!\" to her son, instead of \"Jean-Luc\" and speaks with the most posh British accent. French isn't my first language either, but it's really not that hard to learn how to pronounce a French name like the French do.This is the most basic job of all basic jobs, pronouncing the name of the show's main character correctly, and you'd expect that they would have her say the name \"Jean-Luc\" during the casting process for the role. Did the casting director fall asleep and was too ashamed to admit it? And how on earth did the filming director sign off on her pronunciation of the name when they filmed it?I don't mind if other actors that play linguistically challenged American characters pronounce his name the wrong, American way, because it makes sense. But if you're supposed to be a French character, then you have to pronounce the name in the correct, French way. I mean, even Patrick Stewart pronouncing his own name \"John, Look!\" is somewhat plausible, given that he's probably been called that his entire life and he's probably given up by now that anyone will ever live up to this minor phonetic challenge of pronouncing his name correctly - and after all, as we saw, even his own mother was unable to pronounce the name she allegedly gave him. If we accept his mother's wrongful pronunciation as part of the lore, it is reasonable to assume he even grew up thinking that \"John, look!\" was his actual name instead of \"Jean-Luc\".Also, the make-up artist who did Laris' Vulcan ears did a really horrible job. I was so distracted by these HUMONGOUS and distinctly angular ears. I mean, in the Star Trek universe, that's just about the most common and easiest job you can have as a make-up artist, right? And to screw that up so royally...12 minutes into S02E01, the USS Avalon is shown to be thrown off its course by a spatial anomaly that suddenly formed out of nowhere. They send the following transmission back to starfleet command: \"We've detected a spatial anomaly. Please advise.\" Lol, what kind of advice is starfleet command supposed to give on the basis of such vague information? Really, the least information they could've given is that they were thrown off their course by the anomaly, but instead they chose to use the word \"detected\", which could mean a couple of lightyears away depending on scanner range. Honestly, what was the writer of this scene thinking? Or did he intend the entire bridge crew of the USS Avalon to look like intellectual bottom dwellers who try to eat soup with a fork?It's even worse that later on, Seven of Nine, a former Borg, sees this anomaly, and fails to notice that the anomaly is glowing in the same green as all Borg-technology. A little later, Picard, a.k.a. Locutus, also sees it and doesn't think about the Borg. And once Picard hails the sender of the mysterious signal coming out of the anomaly - whaddoyaknow - a Borg ship appears. Surprise.I'm sorry, but these green energy emissions have been part of Star Trek lore for 3 decades now, and you're telling me that not even two former Borg saw this coming? Because I saw it coming the second this anomaly showed up on screen.And despite these massive flaws, the long anticipated return of Q at the end of episode 1 with the line \"Welcome to the very end of the road not taken.\" sent shivers down my spine, because Q has always been one of my favorite Star Trek characters and I've always been a sucker for elsewords stories. 2 Birds, one stone.I thought at that point that it will be interesting to see how, or if, they will tie the narrative knot from the borg incident to the sudden, so far unexplained appearance of Q.Well, let me tell you with every minute watched, it got less and less interesting. And more convoluted and disoriented and cringe. And at some point I caught myself hoping that all the characters would just die as soon as possible so that we can give this show a wrap. Watching all 10 episodes was agonizing, a sacrifice I thought I had to make in order to write a fair review.This show was a mess from the beginning, but somehow it turned into an even bigger mess with season 2. So, in the final episode, they kinda tied most of the narrative knots, but the way they did it (by straight up spelling it out) was just as bad as the rest of the season. And the knots they didn't tie up - tbh I don't give a s... because I don't care about any of these characters anymore, not even about Picard - because he stopped being Picard in season 1 already and drifted off even further in season 2.This show is Star Trek by name only. Yes, we get to see some familiar characters from the TNG Universe, but nothing else fits in the Star Trek Universe.","rating":"2\/10","date":"30 September 2022"}

Picard witnesses the death of a character and about three episodes later asks if the character is alive. His question may be explained later, but I did not last that long. There is little character development, which may account for the characters being unlikable.

I really wish we could get some good non-woke story and escapism, but I guess it's Kurtsman rather use it as a platform for influence. Big fail just like STD.

The story arc is pointless and convoluted and just an excuse to bring back some characters of old.\nI've stuck with it as it's something I can watch instead of sitting through The Voice with my wife but honestly, if you're a ST:TNG fan, you're best avoiding this so you're not disappointed.","rating":"1\/10","date":"10 March 2020"}

Sir Patrick Stewart has given the middle finger to a character he became famous for, and Alex burgzman or whatever his name his has taken a big steaming dump on the sorry state Picard has been left in. It's as if sir Patrick has completely forgotten all the good work that was done in TNG, and just stuck a giant middle finger up to the entire fan base.Rubbish plot, rubbish special effects, Patrick Stewart is bored and shows it, it's so far removed from good Star Trek, I don't know why anyone bothered with this sorry mess in the first place.Only Jonathan frakes remembers how to act like his character and is the one highlight I found. Jeri Ryan was woefully underused, would have been utterly fascinating to see what seven of nice was like after her adventures in voyager, but literally blink and you'll miss her.The rest of the characters are just boring. Utter drivel.How can the opening shot of the tv show be it's best moment!?

{"title":"Star Trek: Brexit","review":"I have seen the first three. It's a melodrama, Sir Patrick's age really shows, and the plot is predictable. I would rather have remembered him as his iconic role.\nStylistically it's identical to Discovery, which isn't my cup of decaf Earle Grey..Shame, I thought I was the target audience. Unfortunately it still isn't Star Trek. It appears to be Patrick's dislike with governments and his age. It appears that he voted for the loosing Brexit side. He is struggling to put morality back into a protectionist Federation. I cant see how this will do anything other than lose half of the fandom in one fell swoop. It's not a vague or an allegory, it's blatant and forced.Unfortunately these aren't the characters we know and love, the Federation is dark and uninspiring, there re canon violations galore, and quite frankly I'm not prepared to sit through a season to see if these hacks build them back up again. Now that I have seen old Patrick acting I unfortunately can not unsee.\nHe's quite frail and a little shaky.

But it had major holes in the story lines and killing off several known characters didn't really help.\nI can now only hope, that second season will be better, because the first didn't really used it's potential. Quite a swing and miss I'd say. But honestly? After seeing the final episode, let's just say I have severe doubts about it.\nAnd to add insult to the injury, I still think that The Orville is doing far better job of \"being the Star Trek\" then Discovery and Picard together.\nBut fine fine.

{"title":"A betrayal of the original characters and spirit of TNG","review":"I wanted to like this series, I really did. I kept watching in the hope it would improve. But it didn't. Picard himself is reduced to a shadow of his former self -- he has no spirit, no determination, no values. Seven of Nine is conveniently written in as an embittered bounty hunter. The other characters are unpleasant, forgettable, and very poorly played. Alex Kurtzman is a specialist in digging up classics and destroying them, along with JJ Abrams. He did a great job in destroying the original spirit, values, and characters of The Next Generation, and perverting them into something unrecognisably amoral, nasty, venal, and shallow, and putting yet another nail into the Star Trek franchise. As for Patrick Stewart, an actor I have always admired, well, he pretty much helped, reducing Picard to a weak, directionless shadow of his former self. Disappointing beyond description, really.","rating":"2\/10","date":"8 April 2021"}

Also from some scientific viewpoitns whereas original star trek tried to at least do funny or cool explanations this is utter crap in that regard probably. A few special mentions for things i hated,machines that are beyond stupid, weird ass weapons that don't try to make sense, the main plot that tries to be smart but is just dumb when it is finally revealed your reaction only can be like really this is it is this satire?, cameos that are so forced into the story they don't even try to make sense, \"Picards gang\" no star trek vibes at all, Annoying characters like the doc, Funny but very flat characters like the fighter Elnor, hippie robots,bad fighting scenes well that resembles old startrek maybe but why not make them cool, the federation seems tiny, where are all the races ?, how will they even build a s2 on that base ?, a cast that doesn't mesh well, some story holes that are just being ignored, trying to make a cool borg story and then not finish it, rafi and her backstory i don't know could add more but then the rating should be lower so i guess 3 is the best i could give for optical efforts and sound btw picards acting also had it's weak parts .","rating":"3\/10","date":"4 July 2020"}
{"title":"Wildly Overrated","review":"1) \"Genuinely thrilling\" - Rolling Stone.\n2) \"Patrick Stewart is sensational\" - The Telegraph.\nNow having seen the first 5 episodes, I can honestly say that neither of the above is remotely accurate. It is as if the writers at The Telegraph and Rolling Stone do not know the meaning of \"genuine,\" \"thrilling\" and \"sensational.\"\n1) Given that Star Trek Discovery was horrible, I was hoping Picard would be better. And, Picard is better, but only marginally. The performances\/actors are significantly better than those in Discovery, however they are limited by a disjointed story line. I get that the writers were tasked with reconstituting Picard - no one should assume this is an easy task - yet the episodes (1\/2, 3, 4, 5) are painfully disconnected. Each installment is essentially a new story. It is as if the writers have no concept of flow\/continuity. There should have been more of the story and\/or a smarter story to provide an effective sense of continuity. But I suppose a clumsy story should be expected, since the Discovery story was abysmal. IE, I would not be surprised to learn that several of the Discovery writers worked on Picard. Beyond the disjointed story, the obvious giveaway that Discovery wrote Picard is the use of foolishly unnecessary 20th\/21st century idioms\/phrases, \"Pain in the ass\" and \"Out of luck.\" There are more issues, for example the unforced error at the end of \"Absolute Candor...\" right?\n2) A brief comment on Patrick Stewart: I like Stewart, he is a great performer, but in Picard, he is not \"sensational.\" Frankly, he comes off as decrepit\/old\/tired. I do not know if this is Stewart's current reality or if this was a character choice. Regardless of the circumstances, Patrick Stewart's resulting performance is bland.","rating":"5\/10","date":"26 February 2020"}

I wish they would cancel this and Discovery, fire all the writers and producers, watch some TOS and TNG, then make a real Star Trek show.Season Two edit: Because TNG was my favorite Star Trek I forced myself to give this another try despite the horrid first season. The perversion continues. It was Roddenberry's vision that made Star Trek special. Take that vision away and what's left is just a below average Sci-Fi show.

{"title":"Great example of awful writing, production, and character development.","review":"This show can be very painful to watch at times. The writers seem to have simply recycled the same plot as season 2 of Discovery - but they just added in borg.Characters for this show are not developed or well written. Everyone is a caricature of a person. Raffi - no nonesense, says it like it is alcoholic. First time we meet her, we get a classic...\"you got a lot of nerve\" scene (by classic i mean completely overdone and cliche).Rios when we meet him, has a random piece of metal in his shoulder and no shirt on. No sign of damage. No mention ever made again. He is docked at Earth - again another cliche. Every time he pops a cigar. Cliche.Pacing is a terrible mix of slow and too fast. The whole show is building to a big \"mystery\" one that you already basically wrote in season 2 of discovery. Just a few small changes. There is nothing subtle about the story or development of story - writers spoon feed you everything slowly or just write everything to be so contrived and on the nose. Example. They literally wrote the Rikers a son and killed him off with an incredibly rare disease - just so they could have Deanna say \"real isn't always better.\"They killed of Hue. That's fine. But with about 2 minutes of screen time what was the point of even having him? I bet they thought they were really clever when they killed him, having Elnor (who represents absolute candour and honesty) square off against the villain (who represents misdirection and manipulation) and oh - he was deceived. Hue dies...in a scene with zero emotional weight because the writers didnt provide us any interactions between Elnor and hue, didnt build up to it at all, and didnt demonstrate how it impacts Elnor.Sloppy writing. Awful editing and production (looks like a Michael Bay and JJ Abrams love child.The writers managed to even make Picard himself unenjoyable to watch on screen. The casting and character development is an absolute tragedy. Generally the strength of Trek series is the chemistry between the cast and character driven stories. We have no chemistry and the characters seem to exist only\nto advance the plot - which makes them very unenjoyable to watch.I wish producers would stop giving their incredibly loyal fanbase the middle finger with overproduced and poorly written series.","rating":"1\/10","date":"12 March 2020"}

Why is no one responding to phaser blasts? No police in the 25th century? Claiming to recreate an android from a positronic neuron is ridiculous.

{"title":"Horrible!","review":"I grew up with Star Trek. The Original. Then I watched all the remakes but this new Pukard (yes puke) series is an abomination. Great graphics, Technology, Cinematographic, somewhat decent story until the last episode where they crammed what needed to be 4 or 5 more episodes into one but the Drama and Acting was about as dumb as a box of rocks. I admire Pickard and the original TNG but dude, your 80 years old. Retire already. The best thing about this show was Jeri Ryan which is still HAF and did a pretty decent job acting and playing a bad ass with the script they gave her. Soji, the most advanced computer android ever made was like acted like a 16 year during that time of the month and Michelle Hurd needed to be flushed out an airlock in the first episode. People used to complain about Deanna Troi but I would take her 10 times over dimwit personality of Hurd in this series and I wont even waste my time getting into stupid script Dr Agnes played or Commodore Oh.

{"title":"Only tolerable if you consider this non-canon","review":"Not-so-dumb science fiction story that would have been tolerable as a stand-alone movie. Whithin the Star Trek universe it's unbearable in its negativity. Going from 1966-to-2005-utopia to fashionable dystopia is not bold but cowardly, because it requires much less creativity and imagination. The Characters resumed from TNG resp. VOY don't fare well: Picard is embittered, Troi and Ryker kitschified, Data mystified and Seven morally degenerated. In this condition, they have to act in a web of plagiarism reaching from Star Trek itself (Search for Spock) via Star Wars (the Millennium Falcon with its crew) to Underworld (Romulan = Vampire aristocracy). This is the consequence of rushing out the whole production staff in 2005 instead of letting Rick Berman build up a competent successor.","rating":"2\/10","date":"13 May 2020"}

{"title":"Illogical","review":"If you are expecting the same logical response and reasoning you would expect in previous Star Trek shows, including The Next Generation, then you will not find it here. The people who made this show clearly did not watch and understand ALL of the previous Star Trek shows. It was misunderstood in Discovery, and now not just misunderstood but thrown out the window for Picard. As captain (now admiral) Picard once said: \"there is no logic in this at all!\".The story is so full of plot holes, it would have made Spock want to leave our planet and designate it as having no intelligence. A major one that was supposed to drive the story is If androids\/robots\/AI were the enemy to life itself, why didn't the Romulan 'KGB within KGB' (Zhat Vash of the Tal Shiar, I listened!) go after them in the previous Star Trek shows? And the way they went about it of going after them makes them not just horrible people to their own race they swore to protect, but ****ing stupid and illogical.The 'KGB of KGB' want to extinguish all synthetic life by hacking into the androids on Mars to destroy the Federation ship building stations; when those same ships were needed to rescue the Romulans from their home planet being destroyed by a supernova. The Federation gave up on following their own core protocol in saving lives, because some species threatened to leave if they persisted, and thought the best way to save face is to blame \"synths\", and therefore banning them. And then they hear someone continued anyway with Data's remaining synthetic brain cell in creating a group of androids, in duplicates, with Data's full memory, but not really, on a secret planet. So, they play the cat and mouse game of finding the new androids before the androids could unleash mayhem by bringing forth the synthetic equivalent of a demon god from Romulan mythology.For starters, if they knew a supernova was going to happen, couldn't the Romulan STAR EMPIRE have prepared something about it; especially with their large armada of ships that were evident to have existed but not appear until the last 2 episodes of this show?! If they had the technology to hack synths, then couldn't they have done it with the androids as well? And instead of having them commit genocide on everyone, just do it to themselves? Also the Romulans are a cousin species of the Vulcans, so they are strong and intelligent but also clever and cunning, downright mean; hence why they have an empire and not a federation. If their 'KGB of KGB' are supposed to be very intelligent patriotic-spies, then how could they not have considered that if the \"synths\" were pushed in that dire straits of a situation, then they might just revolt, for example, by calling down on their synthetic god?! They're not very bright are they?!?!Those were just some examples of major plot holes. Now imagine that, big and small, all over the place in the entire season. And then to top it off have bad dialogues, illogical science (compared to the usual you would hear and make some sense of in other Star Trek shows, that's a low), blatant sexism, some ageism, propaganda driven, 180 character changes (since when were Romulans nice or carry swords in their day and age?); and then displaying it to you as if you're a baby. I bet the people who wrote this watched Avatar The Legend of Korra and thought it was a good show, and the final scene of Korra and Asami leaving together displayed the best surprise ever; because that's what they did in the final scene with Seven-of-Nine (of all people!!) and this new character Rafaella, who was nothing more than a whinging, smoking, stoner, alcoholic, Picard-battering, terrible mother who kept calling Picard \"JL\".The only thing good that was worth mentioning is decent to good graphics, and seeing some of the old cast come back. But Christ did they do the old cast dirty, especially to Picard and Seven-of-Nine. For crying out loud they didn't even get the lore right...","rating":"2\/10","date":"23 May 2020"}
{"title":"I'm so disappointed","review":"I love Star Trek, having grown up with and learning from TNG. My dad and I would discuss episodes and identify the values it was teaching us.\nWhen I learnt of Sir Patrick returning, I was so excited. Sure he didn't want to do a similar show to TNG, but surely this was not what he meant either!\nIt's NOT Star Trek.\nEvery episode I still watch with hope for improved writing, to see a semblance of the characters we know and love and to feel some hope of the future which Starfleet and the Federation offered. But still after Ep8, I'm sadly disappointed. Continuously and tragically disappointed.The actors are good, with Jeri Ryan the standout performer for me through this abysmal take on a beloved franchise.Otherwise, I am profoundly disappointed.","rating":"1\/10","date":"14 March 2020"}
{"title":"The further it goes, the more it falls to pieces","review":"So, it's not as bad as discovery. But that isn't a complimentary remark by any means. I quite enjoyed the opening episodes of the series. They were flawed, but showed promise. Sadly, it all unravels rather messily from the middle of the series, like a rather confused ball of string.\nI have to admit, at this point, I don't consider myself a Trekkie... I'm a big fan of TNG and DS9, and will happily watch the original series for nostalgia and giggles. But I was never a fan of the other shows and the movies are a mixed bag for me. I do love those NG characters though.\nThere has been much said about the dark tone of this series, and it not being in line with Roddenberry's positive vision of humanities' future. It is darker for sure. I thought this may have been an interesting take on the downfall of a once idyllic Starfleet utopia. Saying something, perhaps, about modern America. But sadly, this is just an aesthetic. There are some nice performances in the series and I can't really put my finger on an actor I didn't like. Perhaps with the exception of the Romulan lead, who I thought was mis-cast in the role. The trouble is entirely in the writing I'm afraid.\nOnce again, we see a well loved franchise wheeled out for the punters as a cash cow, with no real ideas, or direction, or point. Too many plot points don't make any sense. Too much dialogue is clunky and expositional. It feels simultaneously slow and bloated. As the series progresses, far too many elements are just kicked to the curb entirely, to the point where it becomes insulting to watch. The last couple of episodes feel almost like they were re-written purposefully not to carry plot forward. It's an opportunity missed. There are good characters hidden here and interesting subjects to explore - but can somebody hire writers who have something to say about, well... anything. It certainly doesn't feel like Star Trek, to the point where characters I cared for and had a warm fuzzy nostalgia about at the start of the series, I didn't give xxxx about by the end. And that brings me to my next point. Star Trek was always a family show. I'm a grown up, I'm not offended by swearing on TV. But I wouldn't watch this series of I had a young family. Star Trek - please don't start dropping the F Bomb half way into a series - It's not big and it's not clever - and if your characters weren't two dimensional you wouldn't need to!","rating":"3\/10","date":"7 April 2020"}
{"title":"Second season is pure cringe","review":"The first season may not have been so star trek, but it was still pretty decent watching, I enjoyed it. This second season is painful to endure and it's only the second episode. It's the most half-a***d brain donor nonsense I've seen in a while, and that's saying something. I can't understand why anyone involved would sign off on this drivel, a child could point out many of the unending idiocies of the \"plot\". Something is very wrong behind the scenes of this show.** I dropped season two very quickly, but still have season 3 a try. The first ep was fairly so stupidity free, foolishly i had hope, the second had so some oof, but you never know.. the third was the most idiotic nonsense. Checked the fourth to see if it was all some clever plot. No, just plain brain missing garbage.Rating: negative all the stars ever shown in star trek.","rating":"1\/10","date":"11 March 2022"}

The amount of banal fillers and threads completely unfitting for a Star Trek series is simply infuriating, and at best very boring to watch for the target audience. The end of the first season started to be finally interesting in the last few episodes, but then the second season thoroughly crushed that positive impression.The technical aspects are all there, camera work is good, sound is good, effects are good, even the actors' performance is satisfactory, but for some reason they were completely unable to find someone who can write a Star Trek series.

I'm unimpressed with most of the retread characters (except 7 of 9, of course!), and can't get very interested in the new ones. The plot is slow and meandering, and doesn't make me want to keep on watching to find out what happens next. I've had to re-watch almost every episode, because I fall asleep halfway through, then wake up, realizing that I missed most of it.

{"title":"Just terrible","review":"I've been a fan since first seeing reruns in the early 70s. This is the worst of the ST tv series. If the Short Treks qualify as a series, they are worse, should be stopped immediately and all copies destroyed along with ST:P. As so many before have said, this show is epically bad. Why Patrick Stewart thought that this piece of garbage was worth reviving a beloved character and dragging that stellar reputation (and, possibly, his) through the mud, is a question for the ages (or very aged, as Picard is portrayed). Production values at all levels are non-existent. Just look at those godawful ears on the Vulcan head of Starfleet Security. Saying they're laughable is about the nicest thing you can say about them. The guest stars are embarrassingly mishandled and mostly just stunt casting trying to keep the show from foundering. I could go on, but I won't.","rating":"1\/10","date":"10 March 2020"}

As is the trend at the moment its PC and Woke etc. They have Ruined Picard's character, the once great ambassador has forgotten all he knew, He also seems to have forgotten old friends that we know but remembers ones we have not heard of before. The pacing of the plot is all over the place. The acting is variable but generally not great. The characters are one dimensional and forgettable. The dialog is poor. The action is implausible, in one scene old man Picard gets blown off his feet in a huge explosion in San Francisco and wakes up back at home in France. In fact, the hole show has forgot time and space, its not clear how much time is passing between scenes or how travel is taking place, people just seem to pop up were ever the writers demand they need to be. I wanted this to be great, but its not. Every now and then you see a glimmer of hope only for your hope to smashed in the very next scene. Disappointed but not surprised. I thought ST discovery was ok, not old trek but ok, this might be worse, will have to watch the whole season before I make that decision.","rating":"4\/10","date":"6 February 2020"}

{"title":"Not the future I want to be in","review":"The others have aptly covered moral and ethical aspects of STP, so instead I'll focus on production details that made me give up the first few times. Disclaimer: I'm still uncertain if it's them who forgot how to produce shows or me who forgot how to watch them.Camera work and editing: nevermind that the plot is dragging at barely detectable pace and yet is still somehow difficult to follow, the filming is making up for that by being extremely dynamic. Dialogs are shot with more cameras than I could count and the shot changes after almost every sentence. Are the new hyper HD cameras overheating from all the lens flares? Did audience research indicate that I have the attention span of a bird? I just can't tell. So dazzling are the calm scenes that when real action suddenly happens (say, a deadly fight breaks out mid discussion) it doesn't look or feel that much different. We could have been cued with some tense background music, but the music is already on all the time. That brings us to...Sound and visual effects: yay SciFi! How far we have come in set design.TOS: Here are a few buttons and blinking lights. Yup, it's a starship in the future all right, let's get on with the story.TNG: Here's LCARS, a logically designed and appealing interface that fits the setting. We'll have a chapter on it in the Enterprise Technical Manual, countless geeks will copy it into a Linux window manager, Gates McFadden will learn how to actually operate it to make her performance more realistic. What, \"captain is not on the ship\" and you couldn't tell me sooner? Monitoring and alerting won't be invented for another century, now let's get on with the story!STP: Here's, like, everything all over the place and it makes all the sounds! It's both colorful AND transparent! Cool, right?The Expanse received similar critique for their transparent pads (like, how do you actually see stuff and keep it private), but at least they follow some reasonable style guidelines, their interfaces seem useful and it did not distract from the show. Here the only major accomplishment is making it harder to see and hear what's happening on the screen.I can deal with the dystopia, the selfish characters and even the violence (these are bleak times, ok) - just make it watchable, I'll still believe that in the end the good will prevail and the Federation will rebuild itself. But if you tell me this bleeping and screeching audiovisual nonsense is the best that humanity could come up with in terms of UX then there is truly no hope. I don't want that future, same as a show in the present where designers and editors have had all the fun to themselves doesn't need me.","rating":"3\/10","date":"22 March 2020"}

He is a role model for most people in TNG. You are using the character to sell this TV show that looks like a show produced by someone that watch too many episodes of Game of Thrones.The thing is that today most tv shows use the following pattern:\nIf in doubt:\n1: kill a character or characters or\n2: add violence scenes with no context or\n3: add more special FX or\n4: add some sex scenes.\nPathetic and simply poorly written.There is more violence is this show that in 178 episodes of TNG.You should be ashamed of yourself for using the Star Trek legacy this way.","rating":"2\/10","date":"24 March 2020"}

There was exploration, adventure, new worlds\/civilizations... and humour (yes, I'm Canadian, but then so was William Shatner). There were human values being taught, and showing how different races could get along. AND there was no swearing or cursing! This was also true for Deep Space 9, Voyager, and Enterprise. Yes, I watched (and enjoyed) them all.Then in 2020, along comes Star Trek: Picard, and all of a sudden there is swearing and cursing. ...and it is NOT necessary for the scenes or the plot.

{"title":"Interminable drivel","review":"An endless exchange of overly dramatic, teary-eyed monologues that never comes up for air. The plot over the first 8 episodes can literlly be summed up in 5 sentences. The characters have been reduced to some internal previous psychological traumas and are not developed from one episode to another, the pauses between sentences are so long I find myself wanting to press fast forward. Each conversation is like a breakthrough shrink session or a deathbed confession, which gets tiring very quickly. Picard does not resemble himself, gone are his decisiveness and ingenuity under pressure. I am truly shocked at all the positive reviews.Edit: season 3 is now over (not exactly sure why I subjected myself to it to the bitter end). There is no redemption to this series. Primitive dialogue, boring story lines, horrific acting. Zero emotional connection between Picard and Dr Crusher, Worf is in some floating bubble, Seven's character is completely untethered from her past.

{"title":"Quickly falls off the rails again in season 2. Painful to watch.","review":"Season 2 episode 1 seemed to reboot many of the issues in the first season and I had that glimmer of hope that Kurtzman Trek might have finally given in to the fans and done away with the dreary low brow non-Trek for simps, but as we've been fooled before with all of these reboots I didn't hold my breath. Thank goodness I didn't as episode 2 and three fall back into the puerile nonsense writing again with all the intelligence and cleverness of Saturday morning teen drama.Episode 4 was cringingly painful to watch as the writers once again started butchering established characters for faux drama and gags, with their obviously little interest or knowledge of canon it very quickly becomes overly distracting and unwatchable nonsense. You really get the impression that it's been written for teenagers by teenagers in an after school drama class. All of the characters are immature and unbelievable, the scenes are disjointed, uninteresting and meander from one to another with irritating melodramatic soap opera style going nowhere.It seeks not to continue Star Trek, but to copy and paste over it with generic action and bad dialog which seemingly belong in a cartoon. The actors are caricatures of a Star Trek parody.None of the characters are believable or relatable, and what little dignity Patrick Stewart had and the legacy of Picard has been completely vandalised into unrecognizability. It's not Picard, it's Patrick Stewart playing 100% Patrick Stewart. There's no difference between his acting in this and his commentary in interviews talking about the show. I've no idea why it's even called Picard as he plays no vital part in the story, simply being dragged along for the ride in an inorganic and quite frankly uncomfortable way. His gravitas and presence aren't there at all, and he does have visible difficulty getting the mish mash of dialog out. In the first episode of TNG an aged DeForest Kelley has a scene slowly hobbling through an Enterprise corridor talking to Data, handing off the franchise from one generation to the next. Now, if we instead had that character hanging along for the ride for two seasons you can easily begin to see how forced and ridiculous that would be, yet here we are doing exactly that with Picard.The plot is once again thoughtlessly constructed with no sense of direction or purpose. There's no subtlety to the ideas presented, it goes right in for the kill with current day political issues front and centre without allegory or juxtaposition of any kind, which comes across as really not liking the audience by straight up insulting them. No matter what your position on socioeconomic position, you're just a punching bag by taking ideas to the extreme with a one-sided and forceful presentation without any room for discussion or investigation, no shades of grey, no cleverness. You're simply a bad person because you live in 2022, unless you're a whale expert, I mean a doctor for the homeless. The entire plot is a straight up rip off of The Voyage Home. Slingshot around the sun to try and save the present from the past, land in a cloaked ship with power generation issues, Chekov hurts his head and ends up in hospital, the same punk on a bus, swearing left and right by all characters, and not a glimmer that the cast present relatable characters. It's an insult to the intelligence of the viewer in the same way that Star Trek Into Darkness went down with a terrible plot written for terrible characters straight up hijacking previous star trek stories. I think the writers think they are being clever and \"paying homage\", but that's not at all how it completely misses the landing.Every time Picard pulls from TNG they open a massive can of continuity worms which shows poor understanding of the show this is supposed to be a sequel too, and why is that? It's because the writers are not Star Trek fans, none of the actors are star trek fans, and no one bothers to research readily available information that most productions would kill for - memory alpha. If you don't want to bother keeping in the well established universe, then why bother to set the fans up for massive disappointment time and time again. Not a scene goes by where sloppy writing and lack of research take centre stage, and there's only so long you can keep letting them add up until the goodwill runs out and it all falls to pieces into an incoherent mess of overall bad stewardship of the franchise so far disconnected from everything that made it great to the extent that it really has nothing whatsoever to do with Star Trek. It just borrows some of the intellectual property like a child playing dress up, and all involved don't seem to realise what a terrible and saddening job they are doing.It's totally unwatchable after the first episode and quickly falls into the thinly spread surface level farce of the first season again. Completely abandoning the franchise's core audience. The writing is of a poor standard not befitting the Star Trek universe with unlikable characters and an uninteresting mystery box plot which takes serialisation to the extreme and will no doubt end with an unsatisfying badly rushed conclusion that I have no interest in wasting my time watching.I couldn't care less anymore, this just isn't in any reality Star Trek and my time is more valuable than the childish drama being served up. What was my favourite franchise is long gone now, but at least I have found other more intelligent and well written stories in this golden age of sci-fi. I just never expected Trek to go from the best of the bunch, to the worst.What a pity.","rating":"2\/10","date":"27 March 2022"}
{"title":"An Awful Abomination","review":"How I managed to endure two seasons of this absolute poorly written trash is beyond belief. They took everything that was great about next generation and other characters and completely flushed them and their past character development directly down the toilet. Add new characters with all the depth of a mud puddle and what you have left is two seasons of miserable sniveling melodrama that would only appeal to those of extremely limited intellect. This series is just awful anyway you judge it.","rating":"2\/10","date":"17 May 2022"}

{"title":"Warm Strawberry Milkshake","review":"If you would strip away the special effects and the fame of the actors, there is absolutely nothing left here. Copy and paste ANY current sci fi and blend it in a mixer, walk to th toilet, forget to turn off the mixer, this is what you get: a warm, strawberry milkshake that tastes like fruit loops. Fake and plastic. With such a budget and such actors, how can you possibly screw it up this bad? I mean, watching 1 episode of Wesley Crusher playing soccer on the Hollow Deck would've been more interesting to watch. Romulans with emotions? Evil AI? Romulan farmers who suddenly created American farming values ? Cigar smoking in the future? Living in the desert and vaping? Mental Institutions? A 1920's movie could've reached this point. What annoys me the most is the way this story is presented, so damning self important and dull. No humor. No ideals. No progress. No sense of improving ourselves as humans. No exploration of our emotions or ideals of what makes us human. It seems stuck inside some dull emotion of a 12 year old. It only makes me tense .","rating":"4\/10","date":"7 February 2020"}
{"title":"Doesn't quite get character, story or cutting edge sci fi correct","review":"Bringing back a beloved character after years away brings expectations and a history that needs to be built upon along with being part of a franchise that constructed a universe and a way people behave within that world. Through Star Trek, The Next Generation, Deep Space Nine and Voyager the Universe of Star Trek was built and created a all-ages family friendly Science Fiction adventure show with characters that behaved in a disciplined and mature manner. The character of Picard was a dignified, well respected character with gravitas and authority.In Star Trek Picard the character of Picard is reduced into a meek, wounded man, that commands no respect from the characters around him and his gravitas and authority are blunted. This is not the same man we saw teach us about leadership aboard the flagship of Starfleet. The show does try to explain this away by showing him having quit Starfleet on moral grounds and living with his regrets in his vineyard but ultimately this is a flimsy contrived premise to remove such strong character traits that made him who he is. Even though he quit Starfleet his accomplishments and history with the organisation (the respect he very much earned) should protect him from being sworn at by an Admiral in a juvenile, undisciplined display by a character in a military organisation that would ingrain a sense of control and discipline into how they conduct themselves. This scene is very much there for shock value.The show tries to contrive conflict between Picard and other characters in a sloppy way. Raffi for example hates Picard because his act of resigning from Starfleet got her somehow fired. Why would she get fired for working with and following the orders of a superior officer in difficult circumstances? Why does the public resignation of Picard result in even a court-martial? She hadn't done anything wrong to even warrant a slap on the wrist. This is contrived conflict which gets forgotten about pretty quickly as Raffi begins to forgive Picard for some reason that's not explored.The subject of Raffi allows us to explore the gritty for gritty sake aspects of the show as all the characters have to be damaged in some manner which means that Raffi is now a hermit & drug abuser to add grit to her character. The rest of the cast fall into place with equally dramatic backstories and resultant personality damage.The show also employs gratuitous language and violence to really make this a gritty universe with is a complete departure from the family friendly, sci-fi and adventure TV show. The creators have obviously seen the success of Game of Thrones and wanted to replicate it here but took the wrong learnings from that show as the grit for GoT was part of the medieval world where humanity was still quite primal. GoT was never successful because it showed bad language and gratuitous violence it was a success because of the characters, intrigue and plot which Star Trek Picard doesn't handle well.The other problem is from the story where there are 3 stories vying for screen time in the Romulan Relocation, Borg Reclamation and Synthetic Ban which don't really connect except in order to provide plot devices for each other and none ultimately get done well with the synthetic winning out. This is a mash up of \"cool\" concepts that don't really pay off. The Borg Cube could be replaced with a Romulan waystation where Soji is volunteering helping refugees and the removal of the Borg wouldn't change the plot of the show (in fact it would streamline it).The synthetic story is just a rehash of a plot that has been explored time and time again in Sci-Fi and done better time and time again. A franchise like Star Trek was a trailblazer of sci fi story telling but in Picard it just comes across as derivative here with nothing new really being explored making the show a bland telling against a back drop of sci fi being done better elsewhere.The problems with regard to 3 big ideas all vying for space, really weak storytelling and contrived circumstances lead to a bloated series that could of been 4 episodes shorter. An example would be in my favourite episode of the series \"Nepenthe\" which is actually the first episode I would cut as its a waste of time from the main plot and doesn't really do anything but to set up a cameo for later on in the series. This episode also takes the Rikers and in its Gritty for Grits sake gives them a tragic backstory which by this episode had become incredibly tiring.With the Rikers we get fanservice which is the only real reason why they pop up. With fanservice we get the addition of Seven of Nine in this show who has also become a jaded character with tragedy in her backstory in which we are actually shown a violent murder of a character from Star Trek history.In conclusion this show really wants to be something other than Star Trek by changing the family friendly sci fi adventure show into a gritty adults only show with a weakly executed sci fi premise. The show is bloated and relies on contrivances of both character and plot with the main character acting very much out of character.I was actually going to give this show 5 out of 10 but after writing this review I cant really justify such a high score.","rating":"3\/10","date":"10 November 2021"}

{"title":"Seasons 1 and 2 are junk.

There is very little to like about the first season other than seeing some familiar faces from Next Gen. Season 2 is even worse as it is nothing but a geriatric Picard living in his past. We do get to see some more familiar faces, mostly as cameos, but there is not much there to like. The closure of season 2 is soft and not at all what Trek is about it.The show finally finds its footing in season 3. Most of the Next Gen crew is back for season 3 working together in the way we all remember. Picard is no longer geriatric, but is now strong and in command as we like him to be. I won't go into details, but suffice it to say that season 3 actually feels like Star Trek.If you can forget about the first 2 season and pretend like they don't exist, season 3 makes for a fun adventure into Next Gen territory of the style that made Star Trek great.","rating":"5\/10","date":"13 April 2023"}

Very bad industries quick cash grab series ... shame on you all new franchise... has no brains at all.. the actors all good but the story sucks.. kinda pity to all of them... ultra dissapointed... very very shame..... garbage..FailureAs we've mentioned above, your brain telling you when you can't do something starts out as a safety measure to keep you from doing things that you can't do. However, your brain's understanding of what you can and can't do is constantly in flux. Day-to-day experiences can impact it.If you've recently tried something and failed, your inner critic might still be licking its wounds. Studies have shown that, when we blame ourselves for something not working, we're - at least temporarily - unsure of our abilities to successfully do other things.New SituationsBecause our brains use past experiences to guide us moving forward, new situations can throw us for a loop. This is normal and - for most people - it's perfectly healthy.However, for some people, particularly people with anxiety, fear of the unknown can be incapacitating. Even if the situation shouldn't feel scary.Underlying Mental And Emotional Mental Health ConditionsAnxiety and depression are linked to negative self-talk and low self-esteem in a number of ways. In fact, scientists aren't entirely sure of all of the connections.Some people believe that low self-esteem causes anxiety and depression, while others think it's the other way around. Still, others believe that it could be some combination of the two workings together or that it depends largely on the case.How Negative Self-Talk Gets In Your WayIf you spend most of your time feeling lost or overwhelmed, you might already understand how these thoughts can prevent you from living a happy and healthy life. However, many people don't even realize that they have these thoughts or don't realize how these thoughts are holding them back.","rating":"4\/10","date":"2 March 2023"}

They would also celebrate exploration and learning about new civilizations.The storylines in Picard are focused on confronting Trump's toxic politics. Most people are very tired of that kind of stupidity in our daily lives. We need a break. Instead, the two main plots in Picard constantly focused on 2016 - 2022 politics.The writers of Picard don't understand what their audience wants.

The series (or at least this season) could had been so much better if they bought the original crew back instead of the new one, and made it have more of a Star Trek Feel. and not a Discovery Feel, (which also could had been better) I really just wish this could had been better, It was not Star Trek at all throughout. The only thing that gave it slight hope was rikers and hughs appearances but of course that is the only thing that even remotely is worth a single star.

{"title":"Star Trek is dead. Long live bickering, woke, long-winded, boring stories taking in CGI spaceworld","review":"It is one of those sad, hard truths in life when you realize one of the best TV series of all time has deviated so much from its origins that it is now bordering utter-rubbishness. Then again, we live in a time when our society is in utter social, moral, and imaginative decline, so it really doesn't surprise me that Star Trek too got gobbled up by the lies and deceptions that took hold in every corner of entertainment , media, politics, and cultural dialogue.Patrick Stewart is the only thing that matters in this series. And sadly it isn't enough because the other characters are sabotaging him with the way they are written and are acting. He doesn't have a moment where he truly shines like he did in TNG. After all, this is supposed to be \"his\" show, no?It's more like \"let's turn Picard into a sad old man, and forget everything he has ever accomplished\" Heavily toxic feminist overtones hanging over this theme too; in fact the woke ideology is so conspicuous in some scenes, it made me sick. Starfleet is now an all-female bureucracy fuming with toxicity and rampant personality disorders. Given the present, I guess that's the kind of society they really want us to have in the future: angry females that did away with most males via gene editing and landed on a path to became a monogendered society across all races. I see the Asari connection (ME fans looking at you! The material has been hijacked) (In a funny way, that was a possibility explored in many other strange words the original Trek series explored) So, that's the good future Star Trek gives us, no?Either way these are far cries from characters like Kira Nerys, Dax, Captain Janeway, B'elanna Torres...all compelling female leads or coleads in previous Trek incarnations.People already called this out but bears repeating still. Unfortunately, this show has the DNA of Discovery (an abomination of a show).. Akin to what we see in Discovery, there's no exploration, no adventure, or sense of wonder in Picard. Long gone those intelligent dialogues, plots, and character development that was the trademark of TNG, DS9, and Voyager. Instead we get lots of characters bickering and they overdrive on emo-drama. Seem to mirror the current conditions of our declining society. Very anti-Trek, no?What else...The guy who flies the ship expects payment from Picard. There's reference to latinum later (the Ferengi money). But we were told in TNG that there's no need for money in Federation any longer. So did that utopia really change overnight and they decided to follow the model of Ferengi, the anti-thesis of Federation?What else....Too many lascivious scenes that don't add anything to the story - TL;DL: Too much meaningless \/ forced romance that comes out of nowhere and wastes screen time. My eyes kept rolling endlessly. Cringe on overdrive.Watch the original Treks while you can because I see a future where they will be banned from public viewing for not being woke and cringeworthy enough. That's where we're headed as a society.And please don't go around blaming millennials in a blanket way for demanding a show like this. I'm a millennial too and I'm often dumbfounded when I see my supposedly well-educated peers' utter ignorance and foolishness for giving license to material like this.Put this thing out the airlock admiral.

This incarnation shows a weak man with irrational poor judgement. Perhaps this is his illness, but if this is farewell to JLP, it is a rather calculated character assassination of a true role model to many people.

{"title":"Pump action trek under a dark starless sky","review":"Reduced to narrative idiocy by the ethos of big studios philistine mediocracy, this self-centered unsavory thing is the epitome of our times.Hysterical characters, great upheaval constantly, incoherent jumble of mindless dialogs alternated between affected shakespearean overacted tragedy and silly comic reliefs, all is confusion and noise, until some hasty solution to our heroes grievances miraculously materializes by the grace of goddess pure luck.These show runners clearly dislike all that The \"Star Trek\" stands for.They mistake deconstruction for destruction of characters, and respect absolutely nothing, not because of the changes themselves but because of the gross lack of ideas and ghastly narrative incompetence.However, the viewer is duly forewarned right at the beginning of season 3. Pump action and machine gun phasers?! No, they don't just dislike Star Trek, they hate it.Picard is dying and goes on a last adventure for friendship. Gets cured, now partially synthetic but remaining old so morality is not blemished. The all powerful transdimensional AI beings sprouting from the sky are at bay, at least while no one is playing their \"song\".Then, another adventure, during which he manages to psychoanalyze himself with the help of his late father mental construct, whom he does not remember, over the death of his mother in circumstances he also does not remember, and he does all this alone in his brain while borg roam the villa.At this point the show became so utterly inclusive that even the Borg are now allies, the Q (that petty, awful, all-knowing but not very bright, *evolutionary pinnacle\") is harsh but only because he wants to help (?) Picard reconciliation with his past, or something like that.So, where to find enemies when all of them became the new best friends?Why not the Star Fleet itself (again)?! Lest this sad real world autocracies get angry and censor the show for metaphoric aggression.At some point, when the klingon old gentleman starts slicing and beheading gangsters, which is actually an upgrade from pump action phasing them, I kept wondering \"if the 'The Legacies' witches ever went to space we would still have 'Picard' but with real magic\".So, on to the faery deck, divert all power from the brain core to loud noise and upload it to the trash bin. Engage. Maybe the core explodes. If not, proceed to the next series. Repeat.What is happening with these entertainment conglomerates?Mind boggling.","rating":"3\/10","date":"7 March 2023"}
{"title":"Nonsense childish story","review":"I remember that I did kind of like the first season. It was more mature if I recall correctly. Then the season 2 took everything that made sense and threw it in the garbage. We go straight into the absurd and childish fantasies of the past. Literally.Time travel, is it a mandatory part of any ST franchise? What next, let me guess - a stuck in a come and somebody goes into the patients head to make him wake up? Oh my God! They did just that...How pathetic are these writers and why hasn't anyone told them it's not 80's anymore?And in the past, all the tech we see is of course just magic - because that is what little kids think advanced tech is, and in this case old tech as well. Only tech that is completely useless seem to be the weapons of future. How do they even manage to build such useless toys that are worse than a rusty fork?And how many of these same people are there in the universe?

{"title":"Oh What A Waste","review":"Let's dispense with the biggest part of this that we all tuned in for: it was great seeing Stewart, Frakes, Sirtis, Spiner and Ryan back. Without question. The new actors were generally good (although Brionnes has difficulty holding her own), and I liked some of the character development.So why two stars?Because when you have Star Trek royalty involved in writing, and a Pulitzer prize winner (Chabon) as the showrunner we should get continuity and nuanced character arcs.The serialized plot wasn't bad. The early twists were okay, but the HUGE disconnects from plot point to plot point, and HUGE disconnects with character behavior and interactions were incredibly bad.**A Few Spoilers**\nA character kills a member of the team and the other team members act as though it's no big deal and one episode later are joking around with the killer.A villain is killed (implied because she's under a pig pile of Borg) and shows up again unexplained.Another villain responsible for some pretty vile things, flips sides in the finale with NO explanation as to why, AND our heroes immediately embrace him and TRUST him.Picard dies, and guess what? It's hard to care because the story separated us from everyone who would be devastated by his passing...and is resurrected making us feel punked by his earlier \"death\".Seven of Nine easily hooks herself up to the collective (and immediately becomes the new queen?), and then just as easily unplugs herself with no aftereffects. Picard spent years dealing with his time as Locutus. Seven? No big deal re-engaging and then not. This kind of shoddy character service is rampant.The huge scary \"end of all event\" that the season hammered home every episode is thwarted by...a flick of a remote that turns off an evil android, and Picard delivering a monologue that convinces Soji (Brionnes) to knock out the evil beacon by swatting a hologram that falls apart like a virtual jenga tower. What? These kinds of last minute tricks steal character agency and destroy dramatic tension.The last episode had so many plot holes and character lapses I can't even mention them all.Tried to watch season two...awful. And season three? Q? IMO one of the worst characters from STNG and a middling actor besides. If you watched the end of STNG basically everything Picard and the crew did, didn't matter. It all revolves around whether Q, in his perverted narcissistic fashion, decided to put things right. Talk about stealing characters' agencies! Sheesh!Hard pass.","rating":"2\/10","date":"17 September 2023"}

{"title":"Great start, but (at the latest) the finale totally ruined it!","review":"Star Trek: Picard started really great. Yes, it took some time for world building and character development in the first 3 episodes, but that's ok - since there was need for unfolding the new Star Trek universe after 18 years of absence on TV and the big screen. But at the latest with episode 5 the same plot problems appeared as with \"Star Trek: Discovery\", which I prefer to call \"Disgracery\".BUT this show is better than \"Disgracery\" and has much more potential. The story unfolding in the first three episodes is really amazing:\nThe Federation has lost its idealistic and open minded approach and is in a veritable crisis. Androids are forbidden after a desastrous attack on Mars. But it is hinted, that this attack was a conspiracy by a Romulan extremist group called the Zhat Vash. The Romulan Empire is no more, at least not as we knew it. The Romulans control a Borg cube, so the Borg are in this too. And Jean-Luc Picard is a disenchanted old man, sometimes even smugly. But he finds a new mission: the search for Data and what's left of him - and on the way he discovers a great conspiracy. Picard is still the idealistic spark in this Star Trek universe.But beginning with episode 6 the writers always took the quick way, always the easy way to tell the story. They always prefer senseless show effects over consistent story telling. There are so many plot holes.I guess, the problem is Alex Kurtzman and his team. They just don't want a modern TV show which admit to really (not faked) serial story telling. They always take the short cut, always use \"deus ex machina\" to solve the stories they unfolded before. So they create a dumb AI-god instead of using the amazing AI they already have: the Borg. Then they let Picard die, just to revive him again as a Synth who fakes to be old (I mean, it would at least be a bit reasonable, if they wanted to replace Patrick Stewart by a younger actor - but that they didn't dare). Nonsense and so lazy writing!Just imagine how many great seasons this could have been, if not this stupid AI-god (which for sure we will see no more) is the origin of the ancient message the Zhat Vash discovered, but instead the ancient culture that created the Borg and then was destroyed by them? Just imagine, what stories we could have seen, if these uninspired writers room of \"Star Trek: Picard\" would have used their own tracks and hints and not let them lead into nothing? And make a quick solution by using massive \"deus ex machinas\".Instead the producers prefered Easter Eggs for nothing, nostalgic show effects and a story that in the end is as trivial and as episodic as the old 90s TV show stories.Not state of the art, not nearly in the same league as really great TV shows nowadays. Too bad!THE FINALE RUINS THE GREAT START!","rating":"3\/10","date":"31 March 2020"}
{"title":"Delete the first two seasons and you have a good show","review":"If you plan to watch this show I'd advise you to watch the first episode of the first season then watch recaps of seasons 1 and 2 on YouTube and continue onto the third season.You can even skip the recap of season 2 as season 2 has almost no effect on the show and was so poorly executed that even the recap is pretty unwatchable.Season three is fairly well done but suffers from being non-episodic like the rest of the show. So if you don't like long drawn out plots over many episodes then this is not the show for you.One of the best parts of star trek was the fact that each and every episode was a self-contained story. This show loses that in favor of bing essentially a very long movie. While this can be welcome I think it does not fit the genre well.","rating":"5\/10","date":"10 April 2023"}

{"title":"Mixed feelings","review":"I just finished the season.I must say, they've done some things here that were interesting. Production quality is amazing, acting isn't terrible, the writing-- well, it flirts with a modern topic that I feel is extremely significant.What's wrong with it?Many other reviewers have alluded to an issue that should be obvious to any long standing fan of the series... Star Trek has historically represented an optimistic view of the future. The old show seemed to communicate that in order for us to make it in to space as a species, we wouldn't just have to be smarter, we would need to be more effectively good to ourselves, and the show depicted a future that was a reward for pulling that off.This series (along with Discovery), for some reason, resorts to dramatic tropes that detract from the ultimate spirit of Star Trek.At least in the case of Picard, the writing seems to have opportunities to explore the implications of modern technologies on our future. We live in an era where AI\/machine learning technology is seriously misunderstood. While there are many famous personalities that have voiced their concerns about our future in this context, there are many that hold optimistic views about these things.I really had my hopes up that the series was building up to a positive outcome that reconciled a human existence with that of advanced machine intelligence. I suppose that it is still a possibility, because the ending to the season simply IMPLIED our universe had a super-machine-intelligent-entity that was a destroyer of all things organic. It did not outright confirm it.In any case, I am getting caught up in the details. I am going to keep watching, but I agree that the noir quality of the show is annoying. We get it, you want young fans that are in to cheap drama, but don't appeal to them at the expense of the fans you already have.","rating":"5\/10","date":"30 March 2020"}
{"title":"Who is this for?","review":"This isn't for people who like the Star Trek lore or care about the universe so who was this made for? Because obviously you are character assassinating the Picard we know and that's established from TNG.

Just save your time maybe watch Star trek new worlds because I hear that one is better so far 2 episodes in.","rating":"5\/10","date":"14 May 2022"}
{"title":"10 episodes for solving problem in every season but...","review":"... but the main problem in season 2 (Q and going back to the future) could be solved in 2 episodes because all episodes have too many off-topic discussions and events because script staff didn't have much imagination so they had to delay the end with off-topic events. We often see \"20 years ago\", emotional discussions, kissing. Look at the second season. First episode is good but all other episode are mostly off-topic i. E. there isn't much working about going back to the future. Rois was in an illegal clinic, he is talking to doctor a lot. The same stands for Raffi and Elnor and Raffi and Seven, they are often together and talking emotionally, Agnes and Borg queen are talking often too. Another off-topic event is Picard's dreaming about himself as kid and finding the end or this dream. The last episode is the worst because Q has been enemy always since The Next Generation but in the last episode he is like a friend and Picard hugs him. According to The Next Generation, a new Borg's slave can't keep humanity in himself. But Agnes as the new Borg queen is still human a bit and that is another shame. Changing roles (e. G. an emotional Vulcan in Strange New Worlds) is not acceptable.","rating":"5\/10","date":"25 February 2023"}

However, on Earth, I would presume there are laws. But apparently not in Picard's world. They can just teleport right into other people's homes, I guess. No trespassing laws or defenses against that kind of intrusion I guess.

{"title":"A sandwich of a show","review":"I've enjoyed every series of Star Trek so far, and had high hopes of this one, even after episode one. Great visual effects and concepts, poorly executed. Love the darkness, swearing and upped ante for violence, a new gritty reality. Sadly there are so many negative aspects that the surface positives get overwhelmed.Characters seem to almost always go straight for direct head to head conflict in a most unnatural way, even (especially) old friends. The reason for their conflict is often contrived and we know that in two seconds it'll fade away and they become buddies again.Direct verbal exposition (i.e. characters telling you what's happening) is the way of the walk here, missing numerous great opportunities for striking visual scenes that would reveal the plot in a much more stunning way. In one episode later on the characters all sit around and list, chronologically, the sequence of events that we've already been shown AND told before, and verbally piece it together in the way that most viewers capable of joined up thinking have already done.And using whimsical Emergency Holograms (with terrible Irish and Scottish accents) may have seemed a good way to spoon feed the plot to us, but instead of a subtle breadcrumb trail it's like the whole loaf whacking you in the face.This series is to Star Trek what The Last Jedi was to Star Wars. My only hope (and not a new one) is that, despite the obvious linkages, the next season of Discovery continues in its own way and doesn't succumb to this \"Star Trek for the Attention Deficit generation\" approach.","rating":"5\/10","date":"18 March 2020"}

Lots of death and impending death themes, intended, I suppose to give the story some gravitas, but it just doesn't work. For the most part I can forgive bulldozer sized plot holes if there is good dialogue and acting and I get invested, but here it just doesn't work. Why are these characters dying?

So many different episode and movie story lines are represented here. I love the fact CBS was able to get Sir Patrick back, I love the idea of it, but looking at the whole picture I feel it's a fan service piece.I'm looking forward to more episodes, but I'm worried it's going to get bogged down with it's stories and plot and it's going to lose itself by episode 3. I feel it's all very forced and all very convenient.Side note: I loved the episodic nature of Star Trek, each episode it's own story. Discovery was a crazy push for Trek, several arcs driving the plot forward. I wish they would have done Picard before Discovery, giving me the familiarity of the characters with the vision of a season driven story line.

{"title":"Picard: A shell of a character and series.","review":"Seeing Jean Luc Picard on the screen again was exciting but short-lived.Yes, Star Trek has always pushed boundaries and had us question the social construct we call our society.Season two episode four delved very heavily into immigration in California. When a political agenda overshadows the story plot with lack of facts no one is served.The writers could have garnered sympathy for the immigration issue while still using facts not outright falsehoods. Federal law and the Fourth Amendment prevent Immigration agents from entering hospitals and clinics for enforcement actions. The United States is one of only a few countries that actually require a court hearing in front of a judge before deportment.The writers pushed a false narrative to demonize Immigration Enforcement and the fine men and women who dedicate themselves in this career. It is often lost that most immigration enforcement officers are of Mexican or minority dissent.Yes, you can bring attention to the immigration issue in what should have been a great storyline.

It was pretty sad to see what happened to Star Trek in the first season of Picard and the second season is doing nothing new. They could've done so much more with this series. Sadly it's just another bland 2020+ type series that is not able to suck you in nore is it able to surprise. Maybe it's just me but I've seen all of this before and I saw every twist coming from 10 miles away. So there it is. If the story is crap then not even the best actors can make it work. Sadly a lot of actors here are crap and a lot of the action is crap too. Some of the visuals are very nice but that's about it.

He sent Nella Daren, the woman he loved on a mission where he was sure she would die and she did. He had to watch twice as one of his closest friends, Data, died.This man was traumatised over and over again.Why the writers thought I cared in the slightest that he had mommy issues as well is beyond me.And why the writers of Star Trek set out to make the most unique and dangerous antagonists in all of science fiction ever weaker and more pathetic. They showed in TNG and Voyager that individuality weakened the Borg (Hugh, Lore as leader of a group of Borg), Borg don't ignore individual traits, they integrate them and spread them in the collective. And then the Queen was introduced, a Borg you can negotiate with and trick. And she is a single Borg who, if killed, weakens the whole collective.

In Season 2 there are so many tongue in cheek moments you spend most of the season rolling your eyes. The borg queen overacts like she's in an amateur stage play. I appreciate what the show tries to do with the Noonien Soong family tree. Unfortunately though, this show relies on fan service to hide behind a poor concept, terrible writing, and sometimes bad acting. I would love to see a Star Trek series that takes place after TNG.

{"title":"Kelvin timeline not the original one","review":"For all possible viewers: This is the Kelvin timeline from the 2009 movies. It has nothing to do with the original timeline.If you like the \"new\" Star Trek that began with the JJ Abrams movie in 2009, this series is made for you. This is Kurtzman-Trek.This is a dystopian future where Romulus has fallen and the Federation council consists of racist biggots that refused to help the Romulan Star Empire evacuating their citizens before this stupid supernova occured (that would be predictable millions of years in advance).This first episode was made to pull you in with Patrick Stewart. But the dialoge is aweful, the future is dystopian, not hopeful, there are 18 minutes off dumb action scene in the first episode, phasers don't exist anymore, it is far more effectiv to kill someone with a knife, a woman that has been cloned from an android (i'm sorry i can't even say that with a straight face)...The list of stupid goes on.This is Dumb Trek, not Star Trek.For someone who really understood what Gene Roddenberries vision was about, this series pains me greatly. Star Trek was about tolerance, freedom, hope, cooperation and the possibility that humanity could become more enlightened than we are now.For Kurtzman, JJ Abrams and their cronies, Star Trek is a franchise they can exploit, rape and kill over and over again, until it is a stinking husk that no one will touch ever again.The real Star Trek ended with TNG.","rating":"1\/10","date":"28 January 2020"}

{"title":"Ugh!","review":"The Federation of the 2400's has finally sunk to the insincere pandering of 2023. They now use the \"f-word\", drink more (one seems to be a drunk), and bond with the poorest writers in Hollywood. One of the most tiresome cliches is having a character switch to good\/bad\/good, etc. Several characters are annoying, (like Dr. Smith on \"Lost in Space\"). Also irritating is the tiresome holographics and worn out special effects that are subsituted for plot. Where is Rick Berman when you need him?Hire better writers, like those on 1883 or Boston Legal, because THIS is enough to make me drop out of Star Fleet Academy.","rating":"2\/10","date":"8 March 2023"}

{"title":"Unwatchable Garbage: A Betrayal","review":"Picard is a turgid, clumsy, contrived and malicious subversion of a beloved character, made by the usual roster of talentless hacks who seem to have their fingers in every pie in Hollywood these days. It is stacked with unlikeable characters, terrible acting, over-the-top special effects, graphic violence, and questionable dialog. In short, it's unwatchable grey sludge that should be condemned and protested against.Not only have Hollywood media conspired to promote this abomination with favorable coverage, but they and the networks have also worked tirelessly to make sure as few people as possible get to see the fantastic The Orville show, branding it as just a silly Star Trek parody and making sure it doesn't get the audience it deserves.The Orville is NOT a parody, it is the true successor to the Star Trek we love; an optimistic Star Trek with great likeable characters, fantastic music, genuine humor and heart. Something that the soulless Picard has none of. Support The Orville and give Star Trek: Picard a wide berth.","rating":"1\/10","date":"26 May 2020"}

{"title":"Unwatchable Rubbish until Season 3","review":"Watch Season 3 only and skip the first two seasons.I now tell people who have not seen the show to just watch season 3 and that is it. They only need to know that one bit of information on Picards health from the end of Season1.About my only gripe with Season 3 is that it is once again a very dark story.At this point I kind of give up, Trek will never be fully Star Trek so long as they keep making shows where violence and character rehabilitation is a a primary form of entertainment, but at least Season 3 still has many of the other elements that made STNG a really good show.Hollywood is has gone dark and Morbid and I guess some people like that. At the end of hard days work I want to Laugh, I want to be entertained but I don't want to see more of the brutish horror that exist in the darkest sections of peoples minds.Original Review Season 1 & 2\nThis is not Star Trek, this is just a bunch of fan favorite characters woven into a Plot hole filled easily deducible bunch of Rubbish. I can honestly say without exaggeration that a bunch of college play writers could come up with a better story than this one.Season 1 was bad but season 2 is a complete Train wreck. I just finished watching the last Episode of season 2 and it was just as bad as all the others.Patrick Stewart was just given a free rein to play whatever part he felt he wanted to play. About the only character in the show that managed to at least save a bit of there reputation was Seven, but even she ended up with a lot of character bruises. She of course had to be in vogue with what Hollywood expects strong female characters to be, which oddly enough also includes being ultra violent. Dunno what message they are trying to send, but it's not good.","rating":"5\/10","date":"1 May 2022"}
{"title":"Sad to waste talent and potential","review":"I LOVE Star Trek as one of my earliest memories is watching the original series with my brothers and sisters when I was a child. I remember the ship zooming at me and my older siblings comforting me when parts scared me by saying \"It's just a TV show.\" But it embedded itself in my brain and heart.I've faithfully watched every from DS9 and Voyager and Picard, as form many others, was my favorite captain. So I was very pleased to hear of this new opportunity for great story-telling.But once I started watching I had to force myself to finish. The story line and writing is terrible! It fails to create any drama but continues to pretend there is immense drama. It takes characters we have loved and cared about for years and made them into pathetic shallow mouth-pieces of uninteresting dialogue. The way it is produced makes reminds me more of a super hero movie than Star Trek. Certainly it has lost any desire to present moral or interpersonal drama in a intriguing and accessible way.","rating":"5\/10","date":"7 April 2023"}
{"title":"Who?","review":"Who is this old man?\nWait, that's not Captain Picard!\nAnd who is this woman?\nWait, that is NOT Seven Of Nine!\nThey Ruined these Characters! They ruined it all!Seriously, this is not Star Trek and here is why:Why does Data only call out to Captain Picard?Geordi La Forge has always been Data's closest friend in TNG!He respected Data right from the StartHe was always giving him help and advice regarding Data's wish to be human without making fun of himSo why does he not send for Geordi to help him? Especially since Picard was\nalways \"mildly annoyed\" by Data. The captain respected Data merely on a professional level, but a deep close friend to him, he was never!So where is Geordi?Why do the Romulans need help from the Federation?The Romulan Star Empire is...well...A BLOODY EMPIRE... with hundreds and hundreds of planets under their rule, a huge Starfleet to enforce their law and keep the empires peace.\nAnd now you are telling me that this SUPERPOWER of the galaxy cannot mount its own rescue mission and is also not able to relocate its refugees on the hundreds of hundreds of planets they rule?This! Is! Absurd!Regarding the above, keep in mind that these refugees are the inhabitants of their former home world, so basically the most romulan Romulans there are. And now the rest of the empire leaves its own core-people living as poor bums without any help what so ever scattered in federation space.... Yea, right!I could go on about the Romulans in this show, since they are portrayed so immensely wrong and unlike the Romulans in original Trek but that just would take too long.Speaking of poor bums:\nIt has been established countless times in original Trek, that poverty, hunger and suffering has been abolished in federation space in the future...Remember when Seven Of Nine was a gun wielding super mercenary in Star Trek Voyager?What? You do not remember that?Well that's probably because she wasn't. She has always been a scientist and later a teacher to the freed Borg kids.Data had a \"daughter\". Her name was Lal. He loved her dearly and was actually sad when she died in TNG.\nSo why was he painting this Soji-person and dreaming about her as his daughter?They cloned Data...an android...how? How does one clone memory from something that does not store memory...what is this nonsense?Am I the only one ore does this show strangely feel like they were trying to copy the Expanse...just in the Star Trek universe?Rocinante in the Expanse, La Sirena in Picard...Spanish named ships in both shows-rag-tag group of people who have to do something in a dystopian dark future, also in both showsCom on...it is obvious...with the exception that the Expanse works...STP does not!There is more wrong with this show, but these are the things that bothered me the most.\nIt is as if the creators of this show did not watch original Trek since they know nothing about it.Hurr Durr, who famous in Star Trek?\nHurr Durr, Picard and Data!\nLet's put in show!\nSeven Of Nine also famous, Hurr Durr...and hooooooot!\nLet's put in show, too and they have to do THING in space!\nNOW SHOW GOOOOOOOOD, Hurr Durr!This is how I imagine the creators planned this. Nonsense! Shame on them!No all jokes aside, my final recommendation:\nIf you are interested in Star Trek and want to enter the Universe, don't watch this! Focus on Original Trek and start either with The Original Series (the 60s style of this isn't for everyone, granted) or The next Generation, which is a must see!\nBut this show is garbage and should not be regarded canon!","rating":"2\/10","date":"15 January 2021"}

I don't want to have to write a subpar \"review\" in this, or of this series. For gods sake, we have Sir Patrick Stewart playing Picard!! Please tell me there is going to be a huge improvement in this series!! I honestly had an easier time with Discovery. At least there I knew they would be messing with visuals, etc because of when TOS was made etc.Nothing of value happened in this episode, except for possibly a little backstory on what might have happened to the Borg cube.\"JL\"'s last #1 is horribly written and acted so far. She's a druggie? ... is that what they are supposed to be depicting here? Where does she get off calling Picard \"J L\" .... while she was his #1?!?!? Does anyone actually think Picard is going to be \"on his own\" when they get to Free Cloud?I didn't realize that was Hugh until almost the end of the episode. So Romulans are spiritual mumbo-jumbo folks now?Are those drones being \"reclimated\" still alive? ... or are they being set free from their Borg bondage so their spirits are finally at rest?Three times now, these super-duper Romulan ninjas have gotten their asses kicked. Once by the recently activated Dahj (I forced myself to accept this one because of what she might be) and the second time they can't overwhelm a android girl and Picard in an open setting - they got their target by accident! (dead dying Romulan spitting his green goo), then they pop into Picards very dim abode... and get completely schwacked by 2 Romulan housekeepers and a 90yr old Picard that didn't know they were coming!! I know Zhaban and Laris have some sort of history with the Tal Shiar, but damn ...Did anyone get a creepy feeling when Narissa and Narrak interacted at the end of the episode? ... I thought they were supposed to be brother and sister? ... little sensual here?You could have completely skipped the entire second episode, watched the \"previously on Picard\" and been fine.So we have northerners and southerners on the old Romulus. .... are they going to use that as a reason for the Irish accents? .... the damn EMH, NMH whatever the plot needs. \"H\" has an Irish accent too?I can sort of understand why the ambiance on the Borg Cube is dark, but come on man... brighten it up!! you need a flashlight to see in Picard's home and the ship isn't any better. This is post-TNG Trek... not BSG.We are 3 episodes into a 10 episode season and the only 2 characters I care anything about now is Picard and Laris. I wish she was coming on the ship.Soji's mom turns her off? ... is that the same mom that Dahj had? I couldn't tell. I thought she looked different. Could \"mom\" be Maddox?Sorry, but not much here yet I guess.Discovery season 2 with Pike, Spock and #1 was much better so far.Commander Oh with sunglasses?Maybe the trailers have influenced my disappointment to this point. I think they showed us too much.I hate to be a downer here, but...SHE's the DESTROYER!!!!!! Whatever the hell that means... one of 2 twins, that show up on a Romulan board thing of some kind...

Why do we need everything gloomy. I know there's an energy crisis but couldn't they afford a few lighting rigs?Finally, in season 3, episode 4 power is running out, they're making savings by getting crew to congregate in common areas and yet Picard takes his don into the holodeck.

However! Once again Picard is a strong & stoic leader.Old characters have come back and been shown relative respect; although, sadly, Worf's amusing hyper masculinity has been castrated somewhat.The story feels like Star Trek; feels TNG. Thankfully, the neo PC politicising has been dulled down which makes season 3 more universally relatable.UPDATE: I thought they will allow it to be untarnished.But the last Ten (Girl power!

Wow, it's awful.I was reading sci-fi in the 60s, Heinlein, Asimov, Bradbury, etc and loved their stories, their books. Seeing Star Trek as it was released then was such a treat, and I was hooked. Same goes for Star Trek TNG. Wonderful stories.In those shows, the Enterprise was a clean, well-lighted place, and violence was minimal. They were thoughtful and dealt with important moral and social problems and issues, like the situations one might find sailing through the galaxy and meeting other life. Not every alien life was malevolent in those first two series.Nothing is clean or well-lighted in this series. When did the Federation do away with lights in their spacecraft?

I really wanted to like this, its just not fitting for me as a genre I can be awake watching.All politicts, worse just talking about politicts that by the time something interesting happens you fell asleep or started washing the dishes.

{"title":"Should be renamed Picard the coward","review":"I was looking forward to this series as I loved TNG a little over 30 years ago. Picard is basically Saving Private Ryan but in space. Data replaces the mother, and the 2 the surviving daughter replaced Ryan. The problem for me is that Picard is nothing but a washed up coward running for cover in a couple of scenes whimpering and getting his backside saved, why do i want to watch a series about a whimpering old man?. The characters are bland and if they all died in the first episode I wouldn't miss them. 2 main faults especially for a Star Trek series, and what is it with having \"powerful\" female characters now in a series needing to use the F word at everyone, are they incapable of conveying themselves intellectually now??? This for me has no place in any Star Trek franchise, there's no need for it. There have been many strong female characters throughout the franchise that have shown intelligence over profanity. This series didn't feel like Star Trek at all, until for the penultimate episode and the 1 prior, some may know what I mean. Star Trek has always had characters, always had a bit of humour, Original had all the main crew, TNG had about half a dozen characters, DS9 had Odo and in particular Quark, Voyager at least had the Dr, but this, noone. The best part for me was cameo appearances by Data, if it wasn't for him, my rating would have been lower. Riker wasn't bad and wasn't too fussed about Troi but good to them 2 still together for this series. How do I rate it compared to other series? Obvious Original is the best, followed by TNG, DS9 comes in 3rd and I would place Picard inbetween the poor to ok Voyager and the terrible Enterprise.Data was the best this series has to offer, especially the final episode which without spoiling it too much, poignant.","rating":"5\/10","date":"12 April 2020"}

All the swearing, gritty lives and dark theme all tell me that this hasn't been made by fans at all.. They can save it but only by using more original cast and by getting some fans involved. It resembles nothing of genes vision and its a real waste of talent. Picard, Data and all the others deserve better. I tried real hard but couldn't get into the plot of this girls story, I just wanted to see the old crew back together with maybe additional characters from other trek shows but instead they've ignored fans and made a guardians of the galaxy type show.. I hope there's a season two and with it, I hope they get back to star trek..

I grew up on Voyager and I absolutely adore DS9 but I'm not one of those nostalgic fans that can't take new things in. Picard started out good but with 7th episode it's getting harder to remain interested. Every episode is a copy of itself, the plot is unecessary dragged, emo talk and tense moments could be two seconds shorter, the dialogue is plain stupid, witholding of critical information when there's an oportunity to spit it out is outrageous. Repetition of same lame sentences aimed at Picard's ego is brutally annoying and I don't understand how such an amazing person can simply forget to clarify things with the android in distress. I thought it's going to be nice to see Riker and Troi, but that's all it is, nice. The script of that particular episode is so incredibly bad that even them two can't help it. It was really fun to see Seven of Nine though, and regarding the new crew - there is humour and they seem to be likeable, although 7 episodes in and we're not there yet. Take The Expanse or Battlestar Galactica for example. You connect with the characters instantly and no mater how dragged it sometimes is you enjoy those shows. Picard is surfing on old fame waves while the new crew should be the new core and it certainly has the potential. Also having a closer look into Romulans and their mistyque is a very good move, especially for having them more 'vampirized'.\nI will not go into the kanon and how Gene believed in the best of humanity and this is not it and so on, the change is the only constant in life, all fans need to accept that. The Federation had it's slight downfall (about time!) and I do like conspiracy detail within the Starfleet (or whatever it is) and outcast worlds and troubled planets similar to Uncharted Territories in Farscape. If Picard takes direction of Farscape there won't be anyone happier than me, but that's a big bite to chew on, however it has obvious aspirations towards Farscape and Firefly wich makes it less borring. But for God's sake, do something with that writing and horrible sentences.\nAnd to finish, Star Trek Discovery has wonderful characters, a lot of humour, action, and awesome fight scenes, and fans are disappointed nonetheless (not me obviously). Picard has only nostalgia playing, shy and badly written introducing of new characters and it seems beyond cowardly made in that sense. But to the hell with the old fans already, people will always nag how something was better in the old days. Just make us a good series.","rating":"1\/10","date":"8 March 2020"}
{"title":"SO far the worst series in the franchise.","review":"It's even worst then ds9. If I wasn't waiting for new season of Discovery I wouldn't watch it even to kill the time. Three episodes and nothing worth remembering happened.","rating":"2\/10","date":"6 February 2020"}
{"title":"Filled with boring reminiscent monologue.","review":"Don't allow nostalgia to cloud your judgment. This isn't a bad series by any means but at times it can be difficult to watch. As always Star Trek brings great detail to it's character makeup designs. Not as impressive as Star Wars's character designs for their other worldly beings but still impressive. Possibly the greatest aspect of this series is it's character developments. You can easily tell the writers put up a great effort in this regard. Making sure each and every character has their own set of individual conflicts that they deal with. Where it falls short is it's consistent reminiscent dialogue between characters, which ends up taking the majority of the episode's time. This gets old very quickly making for mundane scenes. Especially in episodes 2 and 3, both of which are riddled with this dilemma. The characters spend such a large portion of their screen time reminiscing about the old Star Trek days and events. Instead of creating exciting scenes and making new memories. I honestly expected more with the advancement of current day technology but I was sadly disappointed. It's on the cusp of being considered a bad series in my book but isn't quite at that point, making it a 5\/10.","rating":"5\/10","date":"26 March 2020"}
{"title":"Opinion based on the complete 1st series","review":"Woke-nonsense has killed American TV and cinema... surely, after the heinous mess that was Discovery, Star Trek learnt...?Starting out with black-white couple, I had my doubts, but the action of the 1st episode was thick and fast and Picard was introduced somewhat well, along with a catastrophe of the Romulan empire which piqued my interest. Unfortunately, the plot then went on a 7 Samurai road, as Picard travelled the universe, assembling his rag-tag crew, with plenty of fan-crap chucked in when really, I just wanted the series to stick to the plot!Going by all the negative reviews and people giving up the programme after a few episodes, I was not alone.Eventually, Picard arrives at a Borg cube - where he should have been several episodes sooner - and I found myself to be getting back into the programme (despite an actual samurai tagging along). Also, it was SO REFRESHING not to have been inflicted by the Woke disease! Yes! Star Trek had learnt (just shame about the mess of the plotting).I won't spoil this for anyone, so I'll fast forward to the end, at which point, it felt like an absolute eternity of dreariness and preaching before the series did, actually end. To be honest, it was the inevitable outcome to the plot, yet still, it was massively unsatisfying.\nTacking on an addition (almost) 20 minutes only made the finale worse.In the final sequence, we then see two female characters linking fingers in a cringe-inducing, totally unnecessary moment that made me wonder if American TV shows have a bare minimum Woke quota before they can air, and I fear for the 2nd series - seeing as how one is in development - given the poor writing, needless nostalgia, plain soppiness and how two of the key female characters now appear to have entered into a lesbian relationship.Thankfully though, Picard was void of Woke for the most part... it's just a shame that its creative team were also void of any good ideas or originality.\nPerhaps Worf will appear in the 2nd series to add some much-needed charisma to its bland cast? However, given how insipid this series was, I'll still have to be on lockdown before I go out of my way to watch it.","rating":"5\/10","date":"28 March 2020"}
{"title":"This is not a sci-fi, this is worse than arrowverse level soapy drama","review":"There is no sense of awe and wonder or the complexities of a sci-fi. Its just a bunch of unappealing characters, boring dialogue, a slow and predictable story and the whole show (as of ep 7 out of 10 episodes) is leaning on a gimmick about some terrible unknown leading the ones in the know to commit terrible atrocities justifiable by this \"unknown\". Everything apparently hangs in the balance and everything is due to this \"unknown\" and it is terrible, I've been told repeatedly by the characters over and over again stressing that whatever they decide to do for \"plot\" is justifiable because of this \"unknown\".\nYou see how annoying it is already to read this, imagine watching 7 hours of this nonsense. I guarantee that the end reveal is going to be something completely stupid and anti-climactic, since all the characters so far have no depth or nuance.\nWhat a waste since the production is actually good, leading me to believe that the creators had enough resources at their disposal to actually make something good, but they squandered it.\nAs another reviewer mentioned, The Orville is far better, although more light-hearted, in much more of the same spirit as Star Trek. There is a more relaxed pace, but there is the same sense of wonder and awe of the unknown that is the hallmark of Star Trek.","rating":"1\/10","date":"6 March 2020"}

No! i'm here to talk about the quality of the writing. I'ts extremely bad. This is the kind of writing we used to find in kids shows like Power Rangers. It amazes me that people actually got paid for this script. The conversation at the end between Narek and Dahj's sister it's so silly, it paralyzed me. Who the heck talks like that? This is only one example of the amateurism of the writers, i'm not even gonna talk about how a star becomes a super-nova so fast that the Romulans don't have time to leave their planet or Picard's obsession with Data...what is that?

It's great seeing Patrick Stewart back in the role, there were some nice nods to the past, and some interesting plots setup I hope they don't flush down the toilet in future episodes. It definitely doesn't feel like TNG, but I didn't expect it to. It wasn't perfect, but there was enough here to keep me watching. I just wish Kurtzman would leave Trek alone because I'm constantly gonna be waiting for this all to fall apart as the season progresses.","rating":"5\/10","date":"24 January 2020"}

{"title":"Dreadful.","review":"This really isn't Star Trek. Gone is the hopeful optimistic tone, at it's heart while there was sometimes violence and danger Star Trek was always a show about peaceful explorers seeking out new life and trying to broaden their understanding of the universe. Characters were often tempted and faced difficult ethical dilemmas they struggled to resolve. The conflict was as much internal as it was external. While the Federation had it's share of enemies, even they were humanised to an extent. This new series though resembles a more black and white tale of good v evil. This is like some hellish nightmare version, so much of it is shot in dark, shadowy colourless scenes. Even among our band of heroes they're the most bland depressed bunch you could meet. It reminds me of Rogue One a bit in that respect.Piccard is now no longer a commander of a star ship nor young enough to be able to get involved in the action anymore, it's such decline since TNG series. He remains compassionate and so on but he's now pretty powerless which is disappointing. Rather than set him a suitably low scale challenge to match, instead he's got to save the universe. The best Star Trek episodes were rarely the ones about all out war or the end of the universe, it was about good writing, personal stakes and character growth. Nobody really grows here, Piccard remains more or less the same good man throughout.This thing just has way to many supporting characters and I found that whenever the focus was on the younger characters I just wanted to skip ahead to get back to Piccard. Some of the acting is also subpar, more so from the younger cast. Each episode series follows a single narrative rather than 10 different stories, the pacing is really slow though, the plot is muddled and the dialogue is really unlike Star Trek. The young characters sound so modern it's really jarring. \"I didn't know Romulans could be so hot.\" Chimes one character. Piccard seems to have lost his wits too, when he realises assassins are coming for him, instead of running inside one of the big federation buildings he's stood outside for help, he instead tries to run up to a deserted rooftop.The thing is also stuffed with so much exposition too, as well as too many characters. Characters just randomly start blurting out long chunks of their past autobiography for little apparent reason. In one scene a bar a man just stands up and starts going over the recent past when every single person in that scene would already have known it anyway. I think they could have maybe done with a few more flashbacks instead. Game of Thrones always found a good way to get through the exposition, for example while doing it one character may make a veiled threat to another, if all else failed they'd put a couple of naked women on the screen, no such look here though in Piccard. Once you get through the 10 minute long exposition scenes, it just kills the pace, the story is literally stopped dead in it's tracks while we wait for these scenes to play out.It's clear they badly wanted to turn this into Game of Thrones. It's full of violence, brooding characters, beheadings, (why are they still fighting with swords in the 25th century?) suggested incest, implied sex, swearing, gore, betrayal, spying. They didn't seem to realise though it wasn't these things which made GOT great, it was the writing, the fact it made you care about all the characters, even the less sympathetic ones, and the fact that no character would ever be caught wearing any plot armour for the first 5 seasons.In this though everyone is angry, and miserable, the lighting is stark, the sets are ugly, the tone is bleak, if you want to swap the bright, bold visionary TV show from 1966 for a star trek full of, swearing, exposition and shaky cam then strap in and watch.","rating":"2\/10","date":"28 December 2023"}

There are some redeeming factors, Alison Pill is revealing some interesting characteristics and you can't deny Stewart's charisma but if I hear Michelle Hurd's character refer to Picard as \"JL\" once more...I'm losing faith with TV shows (and movies to be fair) at the moment.

{"title":"Season 3 tries, but falls short","review":"I haven't seen the first 2 seasons, only 5-6 episodes of the third. At first I had a few moments of cheering and joy and nostalgia as classic characters like Worf and Riker were introduced. But the whole thing is very self centered, and in stead of being classic Star Trek, it's more nostalgia and looking back. What's worse is that the characters have changed. Picard is suddenly unsure, Worf is doing meditation, Jordi is more concerned about protecting his daughter in stead of doing what's right, which was especially annoying, since it's cheap story telling and a nostalgic mess where they make changes that does not fit into classic Star Trek story telling and then we're supposed to clap our hands when Jordi finally comes around.There are emotional moments, but I feel they are drawn out and self centered and in between moments of lots of action.I haven't even mentioned captain Liam Shaw, totally unbelievable and I'm not sure about the motivation for portraying him the way they do.My preference is Star Trek driven by deep exploration of space, the human condition and tickling of my sense of wonder.","rating":"5\/10","date":"7 January 2024"}

It's Star Trek in name only and spits on the grave of the TNG series.The acting is decent, and the script isn't terrible, but the story line is total trash. You'll just spend most of the episode going \"wha...how did that happen...where did that come from...how could that person know that?\" Characters just magically know things they shouldn't, items appear in super convenient places just to satisfy a plot twist.

{"title":"\"Nutrek\" needs to go away","review":"After trying hard to watch this series and each of it seasons, I can sum up my experience in one word: disappointment.Before I go further, I'd say the worst part of \"Picard\" is that the show runners think they are doing such a good job. They think this is all deeply moving art, instead of the nostalgia cash grab that it actually is.I watched season 1 thinking it was mostly okay until I began to notice the \"Nu Trek\" way everyone was talking and acting, that I first noticed on \"Discovery\". In this new version officers openly argue with each other on the bridge and they get panic attacks. Starfleet is also no longer the shining beacon of the future it was once depicted as, instead a huge bloated government filled with secret operatives and organizations.Star Trek TNG was such a wonderful series. There was still excitement and conflict, to be sure, they just didn't rely on a bunch of infighting and character assassination to move the story along like this series does.Season 2 was in no way an improvement over season 1. Same issues.An example of the terrible writing in this series is the fact that every single unique character introduced into \"Picard\" is horribly written, annoying, and pointless. They tried and failed to introduce any compelling new characters to this series at any point from 1-3.I also don't enjoy how this series \"resurrects\" characters from TNG in order to quickly kill them off to generate cheap drama. This happens multiple times throughout the 3 seasons. They just can't bring themselves to kill off the OG crew, but all ancillary players are completely expendable.Season 3 though has to be the worst. Smartly, the show runners realized by S.3 that their new characters just weren't working, so are mostly sidelined here, but the generic plot itself isn't even from TNG, it's from DS9. I loved DS9 but maybe give it's characters their own show? The season 3 was originally touted as the big reunion of the main crew, but all the characters, and I mean all of them except Worf, act completely against their characters. Good writing job guys!It's all a big trick to shoehorn fake drama into the series by bad writers who don't know the material. \"Let's have Riker yell angrily at Picard, that's what the audience wants to see!\" No. They don't.","rating":"3\/10","date":"4 April 2023"}

He is already too old, and no one buys stories where an old man saves the universe again and again. However, it was nice to see Seven back in the game. I personally wouldn't recommend watching it.

{"title":"I was full of hope when it was announced","review":"Season 1\nis a failed show from 18 producers that wants to be a character-driven drama about an old sick man coming out of retirement, but also wants to be a mystery secret agents prophecy cyborg action show where the universe is at stake. It distorts the values of the Federation and it's packed full of issues that don't get explored in detail - you know, like Star Trek does.(cybernetic life vs. Human life, android rights, Brexit, secret organizations, quasi-religious cults, external threat to end all life in the galaxy, feminism, coming-of-age, spies in love, incestual relationship between brother and sister, substance abuse because of trauma\/PTSD, rich vs. Poor, isolation because of setbacks, immigration, refugee crisis, Picard as an old man, what it means to be an ex-Borg, moving on from depression, identity\/Jason Bourne, chosen one story, racism, being a parent\/losing a child and so on)It's supposed to make you care about synths but doesn't take the time to set it up properly. The main synth almost kills all organic life in the galaxy by summoning robot tentacles from a hole in space.A muddled mess with a romulan lady's despair destroying a Borg cube, incompetent people, murderers getting away scot-free, gouging out eyes, drug abuse, classism, f-bombs, bloody swordplay and the season has a lot of consistency and pacing issues. It's just a mess from the beginning (Picard has no friends and is a hermit who gets bullied by Fox News) to end (Picard sacrifices himself for murderous synths but not really because there's a convenient synth body we can get him).It's a 4\/10 at most and the makers of this mess should be ashamed.Season 2\nwas - to my surprise - an even bigger mess than the previous one. How you can mess up Star Trek so royally is beyond my comprehension.It's a low budget season, filmed in LA with tons of side plots that go nowhere and eat up screentime, unnecessary car chases, unsophisticated psychology, lame twists, actors play other roles for no good reason, time travel rules that change from episode to episode, no good Q scenes (maybe 1), heavy-handed social commentary, witchcraft, 2-minute therapy sessions, making characters geniuses who astound with impossible leaps of logic or making them absolute imbeciles whenever needed and a climax that is so unprofessionally filmed it boggles the mind.21 producers plus the writers made a 10-episode season with material for maybe 4 episodes. Congratulations, people, for producing the worst season of Star Trek and TV that I had the misfortune to watch.3\/10 at the most!Season 3\nis a different beast. The new showrunner Terry Matalas wants us to have a nice nostalgia ride with the old crew. And if that's all you want, then you'll get it.For me, there was just too much nostalgia put in there. It's like Star Trek is a museum and not a living thing.The overarching story is kind of weak, though. Three quarters of the season consists of a mystery plot that is completely irrelevant in the last two episodes.Vadic just gets spaced and apart from two sentences in the Borg Queen info dump, nobody seems to care anymore about Section 31, how long this conspiracy has gone on for or exactly how this alliance between the Borg and the changelings even worked. What was the benefit for the changelings if the Borg \"not just (want) to assimilate, but annihilate\"? Why did I have to endure Vadic and her shenanigans for 8 episodes?But these things get drowned out by explosions and a ridiculous scene where Picard can free his son that he knows for a week because he hugs him. It gets really pathetic when they show flashbacks of these few days when they drank at the holodeck or had an argument. Ah! The good times!And this is the antithesis of TNG. Yes you can reproduce the bridge or render the old Enterprise-D but when love makes Borg nanoprobes go away, we are indeed not in the Star Trek universe anymore.Or what about that stupid secret Section 31 station\/horror warehouse full with doomsday weapons and crazy creatures where the only security measure is a defunct AI with personality disorder that conjures up a Sherlock Holmes villain who shoots at you with bullets from a revolver. And the only way to stop this is to whistle a tune that only one person in the universe might know. This is the level of writing that we got.That backdoor pilot at the end just didn't work for me, though. Why rename the ship to Enterprise? Why have a former murderous alcoholic vigilante that Starfleet rejected \"because Borg\" as the captain? Why have Raffi, the worst Starfleet officer I have ever seen as a First Offficer? And then being so uncreative that a former Borg on a ship called Enterprise is being tested by Q (who apparently survived his teary-eyed death in S2). Is that it? No more new ideas?Listen, I applaud Matalas for trying to do a Star Trek show at least but there are too many stupid things in here.Worf and Raffi disappear for an episode with only the flimsiest excuse, only to make a \"surprise\" appearance later and stab at changelings that somehow suddenly also fight with swords and somehow can be hurt by them. It really boggles the mind!It is the season that started with Beverly Crusher shooting a phaser pump gun that runs out of ammo after 6 shots! This is almost as bad as in season 1 romulan agents putting a bag over the head of a synth that can 'activate'.I'm not here to give ratings to good intentions but to review the season. And this last one was lacking. Trading novelty for nostalgia is not a good idea for a Star Trek tv series.5\/10Sadly, this was probably the last time these characters come together. I would like to say it was worth it and they've made some instant classic episodes, but alas!This show was poorly thought out: Picard died but then lived like it didn't matter, Q died but came back, Data died but came back, Ro Laren and Shelby died but got a reprieve via social media by showrunner Matalas and Jurati became a cuddly Borg Queen but a season later we're back with the old queen, no Jurati in sight. 24th\/25th century morals, values and even technology have deteriorated without any reason, like phasers working like shotguns with limited ammo you have to reload every shot or poverty being back in our utopia or a 24th century doctor (Crusher) failing to use a contraceptive.For the future: plan your seasons not as movies, don't just ride on nostalgia, don't let actors pitch their own family problems, only use characters if you really have to something for them to do!Star Trek is not just a bunch of tropes and things.","rating":"4\/10","date":"18 July 2023"}

It's entertainment of a sort, just not the sort I was expecting or hoping for. And yes, the sudden inclusion of swearing just further divorces it from the rest of Trekdom.

{"title":"Bad storytelling and uninspiring plot","review":"I have given ST Picard four stars out of ten. It gets four stars for its level of audio visual production, as well as its talented cast of actors. It however gets zero stars for everything else.ST Picard has been the biggest failure of storytelling throughout the whole ST franchise.All the main characters are damaged in some way and spend most of their time crying. This show is melodrama on steroids and it completely misses the mark. ST has used drama to great effect in its many incarnations, but the Picard writers are in such a rush for us to care about the new cast that they've forgotten to give us a reason to care.Whenever some excitement threatens to break out in any given episode, the writers manage to find a way to shut it down by having the cast spend 40 minutes per episode talking about how upset they are.The other characters also do not act like real people and behave in implausible ways, which become evident as you make your way through the episodes. Picard is also a victim of this, as the writers flip Picard between being a cautious wise old owl, or being totally impulsive and stubborn, on a whim.One character looks and acts like a rip-off from the Lord of the Rings and I'd be quite shocked if CBS haven't received some correspondence from intellectual property lawyers.Roddenberry's vision is a major casualty of the new series. The post-money utopian world of TNG has been displaced by jealousy, greed and drug addiction. The writers never get around to explaining why this is the case as they are in a rush to parody the Trump-era zeitgeist.Then there are the plotholes. A jaded and retired comrade of Picard's suddenly in comand of an amarda? Sure. Someone killing their ex-lover and an episode later it doesn't seem like a big deal? OK. Someone joining the Borg Collective and then leaving after literally 5 minutes like it's no a big deal? Yeah why not. Suddenly trusting a guy who you suspect of murder? Yeah I'm on board. I could go on. The writers do not know how to go from A to B and as a result we are given storytelling that is simply bad.The pacing of the storytelling is a major flaw. This is painfully slow Star Trek and it feels like 10 minutes of storytelling has been stretched to fill a 35-50 minute episode. By Episode 6 it felt like enough ground had been covered to fill 20 minutes of a single TNG episode.Then there are the deaths of known characters. None of them were done in a way that meant anything for the furtherance of the plot, other than to give other characters a reason to cry. None of these deaths felt like they offered to raise the stakes or offered any increased jeopardy. As a viewer I felt repeatedly short-changed.The only hope for ST Picard is that like the TNG it simply improves after its first season. However season one has given me no reason to stay watching.","rating":"4\/10","date":"26 March 2020"}
{"title":"A modern action series with Star Trek in name only.","review":"Star Trek Picard is an uninspired action series which relies heavily on references to existing Star Trek properties in order to maintain any sort of audience interest.After three episodes I have become so bored of the show that I have decided to write my review now and be done with it. Immediately the show deviates from the traditional Star Trek formula by stretching the main storyline across the entire season instead of having episode-contained stories with occasional multi-parters.The filming techniques used also deviate from traditional Star Trek by having harsh camera angles in an attempt to make otherwise boring scenes dramatic.As for ths story, if you can even call it that, it is written like a bad fanfiction with minimal effort. It seems the writers skimmed through a few popular episodes of TNG and threw references into the series from them. Data and Picard's relationship was never as close as its made out to be in the Picard series and the idea that one attack would turn the Federation, an organisation made up of hundreds of planets, into anti-synthetic racists, is completely stupid.In summary, this show is Star Trek in name only. After three episodes I have become bored and moved on. I should be disappointed with the turnout of the show but my expectations were very low from the moment I saw the first trailer and realised that this was rebranded Star Trek Discovery with cameos from popular Star Trek characters. If you want to watch this show then go for it, but wait until all the episodes are available so you can skip through the mass of boring and unnecessary scenes contained within each.","rating":"5\/10","date":"8 February 2020"}

After a long wait, I got season 2 from the library (refuse to watch on whatever cable channel this is broadcast on, the commercials would be unendurable). I'm not sure what happened between season 1 and 2 (new writers?) but I can't even begin to know what to say about the total garbage from virtually every moment on this series starting with the very first episode. By the time I got halfway through it, I was done and made liberal use of the FFWD button on my Blu-Ray player. Needless to say, I will not be planning on watching season 3 or any other season.

{"title":"Pale Shadows - Wretched Fansturbation","review":"I hate writing this review, I was just going to quietly endure this but darn it something HAS to be done.What horrible process of evolution has taken this franchise from its revolutionary beginning in TOS, struggled and found sure footing then excellence in TNG, DS9 and VOY, then fell into a retconning fanshipping mess in Enterprise, the Bad Robot movies, to bring us to Paramount Plus's current strip-mining of old scripts???A film about the descent into chaos we've had would be more entertaining than the messes we've been served over and over by people who couldn't care less about ideas and epic visions. (I'm always sad that an attempt to make a streaming series dramatizing the actual making of TOS was scrapped. THAT was a steamy little soap opera itself).Fandom gets the mess it deserves, and shame on the powers-that-be for both of their sins: on one hand letting true ego-maniacal non-fans work the franchise characters and tropes as if taking their turns on an inflatable sex doll via the bad robot movies and things like Picard season 2 and 3; on the other hand, the sin of destroying the artistic good-faith pact the writer and actor make with the audience to honor and improve the product.Ronald D Moore has been quite vocal about how TNG and DS9 writers fought hard for the gains that viewers enjoyed from Star Trek, as well as how monolithic and unmoveable the studio suits were in the limit-lines they drew that could not be crossed. The studio-centric edicts of what \"was\" and \"was not\" Star Trek drove Moore out, and resulted in the subversive perfection of his Battlestar Galactica reboot, among other things. It also resulted in a new Trek culture that solved the problem by simply declaring Star Trek to be whatever momentary feel-good thing they wanted to make it be, and dress it in the clothes props and tech-babble fans knew.So here we are. Viewers who want fresh newness are pitted against loudly complaining fans who demand fealty to the past, and studio bean counters serve up crap like Picard S2 and S3 and the Bad Robot movies. Sadly, it seems some interesting new things that are coming from Discovery and Strange New Worlds are just going to be dropped, while the suits double down on fan-diddling like Picard and Lower Decks and whatnot.*SIGH* I should have just kept quiet. Seeing this in print has made it more real and just sad.","rating":"5\/10","date":"4 April 2023"}

The ships are different, the paint is different and the logic is different.Season 3 of Picard expects us to forget that season 1-2 happened and we're suppose to accept S3 as TNG return.

{"title":"Bad writing and space elves","review":"Not only is the plot simplistic, but the writing in general lacks sophistication. The characters are poorly realised, and moments that ought to have some weight feel like they are being skipped over. The creators might have had Firefly in mind when putting this together, because it comes across as a bad copy of that format, overwrought emotional displays, a sometimes goofy style, which is perhaps a matter of taste. But star trek this is not. There is of course plenty of room to make changes to a franchise, to update, or explore new ideas without discarding all the good stuff. That is not achieved here. This is stylistic, lens flare goofiness, following on from the mindless action that was the Abrams reboot. It also, like those movies, seems very American, in a bad way, in that it has lost the sense of being science fiction. We do not feel like we are in the far flung society of the future, but rather as if some random north Americans were rounded up at a bar and then given a spaceship. It's boring.Something strange about it is that although written in a way that might appeal to adolescents, it has a lot of graphic violence and adult language. So I presume it is condescending to its audience.A very disappointing first series that is not worth your time if you like intelligent and coherent writing that doesn't resort to stuff like the cheap thrills of a sword fighting space elf.","rating":"2\/10","date":"16 November 2021"}

S1 starts off ok, introducing the characters, the universe etc and all that seems ok. But then it derails. The characters are flat, the story is boring. The villians are meh and their diabolical plan seems... well stupid.S2 - Gets worse. There is so much filler boringness in this season that I almost quit my journey to get to the end of the catalogue. The whole season could have been avoided if one of the characters just said hello (no joking).S3 - The season of reprieve, by comparison this season is good but it's still not great. I am thankful they ended the show after this season so I could end it with at least some satisfaction. The bad guys are pretty good and the plot is ok in this one, there is some cheeseyness but not nearly as bad as S1 and S2.All in all unless you are a real die hard going through the catalogue this show is skippable.

But season 2 is the dubest s**t I have seen in a while for the following reasons:1. In most episodes absolutely nothing happens. Whole episodes filled with important conversations, chain of events etc. Taking place on a few scenes. For example: One episode a crew member got injured and the whole episode is about his stay at hospital with an arrest by the immigration agency. Next season the whole plot is how the other crew members free this crewman. Next episode everything takes place at one banquet etc. Etc. Thats silly stuff without any interest you can mention as little side story but not to fill a whole season with.2. Frist episode is great and draws interest for more. Guess what, everything is smashed with another stupid time traveling story that has nothing to do with the promising plot of the first episode.3. Unbelivable character design and stupidity of those characters just to force the climax of the season. A brilliant scientist believe the lies of the borg queen and let the queen assimilate her because she feels lonely?! After that she is surprised she can't control her own body anymore?! WTF?!

Gene, coming from the same generation as Rev Dr Martin Luther King, agreed with him that \"the arc of the universe is towards the good\" and \"Good Friday only lasts a day\".

{"title":"So far, so good!!!","review":"I just completed watching the tenth and final episode of \"Star Trek: Picard\" on CBS All Access. The series is created by Kirsten Beyer, Akiva Goldsman, Michael Chabon, and Alex Kurtzman. Patrick Stewart is the executive producer and stars as Jean-Luc Picard along with Santiago Cabrera (Crist\u00f3bal Rios), Michelle Hurd (Raffi Musiker), Evan Evagora (Elnor), Alison Pill (Dr. Agnes Jurati), Harry Treadaway (Narek), and Isa Briones (Soji\/ Dahj). We also get to see some familiar faces such as; Jeri Ryan (Seven of Nine) Jonathan Del Arco (Hugh) Brent Spiner (Data) Jonathan Frakes (Will Riker) and Marina Sirtis (Deanna Troi).In the March 27th issue of The Guardian, Stephen Kelly's review of Star Trek: Picard, says this in part, \"Trek used to be a vision of an optimistic future. . .\" Kelly goes on, as he sets the scene of a speech made by Captain Picard to some folks just revived from suspended animation, \"A lot has changed in the past 300 years. People are no longer obsessed with the accumulation of things. We've eliminated hunger, want, the need for possessions. We've grown out of our infancy.\" In these couple of sentences, Kelly paraphrased exactly what Star Trek creator Gene Roddenberry, had in mind when he envisioned the futuristic world of Star Trek in the 1960s. Throughout the numerous television series and films those ideals were held true. Although I loved revisiting old \"friends\" and learning what became of them after 26 years, I was disappointed that the original Roddenberry vision was jeopardized in this latest Star Trek outing.One thing \"Star Trek: Picard\" does have is plenty of action. Plenty of dynamic visual effects. Plenty of stories. Plenty of history. And plenty of new faces; such Isa Briones who does double-duty playing a mysterious young woman, Dahj, in need of help from an old friend she does not know, Jean-Luc Picard. Dahj, unfortunately, survived two episodes when she was murdered by a secret society of Romulans. But she has a twin, Soji, who oversees a Borg reclamation project deep in Romulan space aboard an old Borg Cube they call the Artifact.There are other new faces such as Dr. Agnes Jurati (Alison Pill ) a doctor working at the Daystrom Institute of Advance Synthetics Research lab in Okinawa. The Daystrom Institute, if you recall, is where Data's creator Dr. Noonien Soong, was a professor of cybernetics. Then there are two former Starfleet officers each with their own demons. One close to Admiral Jean-Luc Picard, Rafaella \"Raffi\" Musiker (Michelle Hurd) was a Starfleet intelligence officer who served as Picard's first officer during the Romulan evacuation. Crist\u00f3bal Rios (Santiago Cabrera) is captain, pilot, and owner of a starship for hire called La Sirena. And lastly, there is Elnor (Evan Evagora) who is a Romulan refugee rescued as a child by Picard during the Romulan evacuation.A lot has happened in the 2 decades since Star Trek: Nemesis 2002. Of course, we all know that Data sacrificed himself saving the lives of his captain and shipmates. The crew of the Enterprise all went their separate ways with their own commands and assignments. After a short marriage to Jean-Luc, Dr. Beverly Crusher commands her own starship (USS Pasteur) providing medical assistance where needed. There were also two huge events that impacted Picard in the worst way possible.Ambassador Spock approaches Picard about his concerns over a star near the Romulan Republic that is about to go supernova. The Federation agrees to help their former enemy evacuate Romulus and orders a fleet of starships ready to transport the billions of Romulans to a new world. Here is where Nero the Romulan time traveling villain from the Star Trek 2009 reboot gets involved, creating the alternative (Kelvin) timeline from the original Star Trek franchise.Meanwhile, in the Picard timeline, Admiral Picard, being the true humanitarian that he is, prepares plans to move billions of Romulans from their home-worlds before the Hobus Star goes supernova. When the Utopia Planitia shipyard on Mars is attacked by a group of rogue A.I.s called \"Synths\" on what would have been the 323rd anniversary of \"First Contact Day\" leaving over 3000 dead and the Federation to band all synthetics.Due to the lack of resources because of the attack on Mars, the Federation had to renege on their promise to help Romulus, leaving Admiral Picard and his first officer Rafaella \"Raffi\" Musiker in a precarious position with the Romulans. As result planets, Romulus and Remus were destroyed. Being of strong character, Admiral Picard resigns his commission in protest of the Federation's decision to abandon Romulus.Now enough with the history lesson, my thoughts on Picard is mixed. Yes, I loved all ten episodes. And the new characters especially Santiago Cabrera as Captain Rios and Michelle Hurd as Raffi Musiker. The chemistry between all three characters is dynamic. Did I happen to mention Cabrera's other five characters? They are all emergency holographs and provide a little bit of humor along the way. There are plenty of protagonists onboard. Newcomer Harry Treadaway as Narek who is Soji's on-again, off-again boyfriend, Peyton List as Narissa Narek's sister, a member of the Zhat Vash and Tamlyn Tomita as Commodore Oh a half-Romulan and operative of the Tal Shiar are wonderful as the Romulan villains. Another character to keep an eye on is Elnor played brilliantly by Evan Evagora, the Romulan refugee, who does not know either to hate or love his old mentor Picard for abandoning him when he was a child.There is plenty that I do like about \"Star Trek: Picard\". I will recommend this as a MUST SEE. But there is one point of contention. The same point that Stephen Kelly brought up in his article in The Guardian. When Gene Roddenberry created the Star Trek universe, he envisioned a world free of hunger, vices, wants, and the need for possessions. Throughout any of the series and movies for the exception of the Ferengi, there was hardly any mention of the need for money and personal profit. Perhaps, in the end, Roddenberry was envisioning some sort of a Socialist culture. He was defiantly promoting humanity.With every reiteration of any television or movie franchise that comes along, the new producers and writers feel the need to \"modernize\" the story. Keep in mind Star Trek happens in the future, what is there that needs to be modernized? I appreciate the \"grittiness\" of Picard. I appreciate the dark pessimism in the Federation. I even appreciate the morally bleak outlook for humanity. I appreciate that the producers maintained a lot of the visual history of cities such as Boston, San Francisco, Paris, and Okinawa. Who knows how these cities will look like in three or four hundred years?In the effort to modernize \"Star Trek: Picard\" here is what I do not appreciate; the foul language, the vaping, the divisiveness, and the needless use of pain and suffering. This is not the Star Trek that Gene Roddenberry had in mind. A lot of what we saw in past Star Trek stories had nothing to do with television broadcast standards of yesteryear. We saw how Roddenberry pushed the envelope when Kirk and Uhura shared that kiss on broadcast TV. We saw it because Roddenberry truly believed the kiss would not be an issue, in three hundred years. So why now are we seeing Star Trek characters vaping, suffering from addiction, cursing at one another, randomly chopping heads off, androids having sex, and treating others badly? Yes, all this is real, it happens today in 2020. But not in Roddenberry's futuristic vision.Michael Chabon, defended \"Star Trek: Picard\" new direction in an Instagram post; saying that \"shadow defines light\", that \"if nothing can rock the Federation's perfection, then it's just a magical land\". While I can agree with rocking the Federation's perfection, I cannot agree with how we get there. To enjoy the next two seasons of \"Star Trek: Picard\" we must lose the language, the smoking, the gratuitous sex, the vaping and addictions. I get the need to \"modernize\" a classic to include the vices of TODAY, but Star Trek happens in the world of TOMORROW where all of these have been solved or eliminated.One more pet peeve, if androids, synthetics, or A.I.s are all as sophisticated in the future world of Star Trek's future, why the need for retina scans or any kind of security to unlock a door? Aren't these synthetics already connected to a network of some kind, and all they must do to unlock a door is just command it through the Positronic Brain's neural network? Just wondering.","rating":"4\/10","date":"24 January 2020"}

{"title":"Very bad Star Trek","review":"Loved ST:TNG and was cautiously optimistic about this look at Picard set many years in future. What a huge disappointment! The logic, optimism, teamwork, and problem solving that was a trademark of the TNG crew in their many adventures is completely absent here. Replaced with ridiculous action sequences, a corrupt Star Fleet, and f-bombs!! The story line also made no sense, had many clunky scenes and wooden acting. Sir Patrick does himself no favours signing on for this series, and should have taken a pass. Barely made it thru two episodes and had to bail on this dumpster fire of a series. They just dont make \"Star Trek\" like they used too.","rating":"1\/10","date":"26 December 2020"}

{"title":"I hope there's more TNG in the upcoming episodes","review":"Well it's only 2 episodes so far, but I'm still not sure whether I like it or not. First of, let me say that I really like Dr. Crusher, Lt. Uhura, Counsellor Troi, Cpt. Janeway, Dax, Ro Laren and to a lesser extent 7 of 9. So I think of myself of someone who can appreciate well played femaled roles in Sci Fi series like Star Trek.Now with Picard, it's a different story. Like in Star Wars, the writers try to force diversity on us viewers. It's no real benefit that all major roles besides Picard (and Data) are played by women. And instead of getting the old crew back together, Picard settles on getting some strange Mad Max(ine?) Powerpuff type girl. Really?Regarding the rest of the story I'm not sure yet. I really like the Android (sorry: Synthetic, are we in Blade Runner now?) story part. All the rest is kind of meh at the moment. Well, it's Picard and I well certainly keep watching, so I refuse to give the series anything less than 6. But certainly not more than 6. At the moment.","rating":"3\/10","date":"5 February 2020"}
{"title":"Name is wrong and this is bad.","review":"I'm not a Star Trek guy, not even close. This was basically my first introduction to a Star Trek show and this is weird pandering, it's not hard for me to see that. The plot doesn't make sense, is Star Trek even profitable anymore? This whole series inspired me to look back at the old show and see if it was this confused in its tone. It wasn't.I don't think I have even a little perspective into Picard through this series, wasn't he like a reserved politician guy? Does this whole show base its poor character writing based on the pretense that characters change during the time off-camera? Also, from what I saw that dude didn't seem like an idiot, what happened?Besides, wasn't Star Trek about exploration and stuff? They spend the first few episodes on earth and it's revealed it sucks. Like, that's cool and all but the length of time they spend on earth is way drawn out and there is like no variation on the locations.The characters never act the same and the choices they make are just excuses to make action things happen. Maybe that's appealing to some people who want to tune out and watch some dumb action but I'm good.This show leaves me with only question and try's to tell you a lot through dialogue but all it did for me was make me actively hate whichever character was spouting it. In conclusion, if you know you don't care about character motivation, fundamental flaws, lapses in logic, and a character mishandled almost as much as my future, you'll love this series. As for me, I can't stomach this anymore. Thank you.","rating":"5\/10","date":"28 February 2020"}

{"title":"Borg politics","review":"Stewart said explicitly in an interview what he doesn't like about contemporary Anglo-American politics and how that shaped the show's overall narrative from the outset. He shall set the Federation back on to the correct ethico-political path. (Is the secret guild the stand-in for Russian agents tampering with elections, nudging us to nationalism?). We'll all return to full acceptance of the other, e.g., androids who dream of electric sheep.It's just too transparent in the - weak, superficial - dialogue and story line.The problem? The world Stewart-Picard wants to make, the 'right' path, isn't really a diverse, tolerant, plularist one; it's a Borg one. Resistance to the correct politics is futile.Wouldn't real liberation come, at least in part, in the form the destruction of the cult of celebrity and the idea that actors and script writers are epistemic authorities?","rating":"3\/10","date":"23 August 2021"}

It seems like all the past acquaintances that Picard meets end up dying. Soji the destroyer? How about Picard the destroyer... I suppose part of that is to help convey the message of how serious the situation is and how far the Romulans are willing to go to reach their goal, but still...CBS, you don't have to kill off so many beloved characters from previous Star Trek shows!!! The show really needs to lighten up some, get back to its exploratory roots, meeting others on positive terms, learning from each other... All this cloak & dagger just isn't Star Trek... It's  a popular franchise and mashing it with the current popular style of sci-fi murder mystery just to make a quick buck, while doing irreparable damage to the name Star Trek. There is nothing here that will stand the test of time like all the old Star Trek TV series.Honestly, I miss the old-style TV series, where each episode was mostly its own self-contained story, and the series of events were only loosely carried on between shows. Now it seems they try to add more drama and pointless cliffhangers just to get people to watch the next episode.","rating":"5\/10","date":"8 March 2020"}
{"title":"Jury is still out \/ On the fence","review":"First episode in. I'm a massive TNG fan (as so many are) and my main concern is they're not capturing the essence of Picard. Here we have Picard, a long standing decorated officer of the Federation with many friends and allies and he seems more or less helpless in his house save a dog and few Romulans. I liked the \"Tea, Earl Grey, Decaf\" line because it's like saying here's Picard but he's changed a little, but calling his dog \"Number One\" seemed lame and something Picard wouldn't do. Also, I'm not seeing Picard with a dog, especially that dog. But more than that Picard just doesn't seem quite like Picard and I'm mostly blaming that on poor directing and writing. It's the words he uses and the way he says them.It was nice to see Data in there and somehow they made him close enough to the old Data considering the actor is now 70 years old.I won't spoil the plot but it does seem a bit gimmicky and unrealistic so far. TNG was great because the science-fiction almost always seemed believable. I'm on the fence and hoping they tighten things with each episode, just like they did with TNG.P.S.> This is a bit off-topic considering it's a season two announcement but I'm REALLY looking forward to seeing Guinan as she was one of my favorite characters.","rating":"5\/10","date":"24 January 2020"}

I mean, in the end, there is a terrible existential galaxy wide threat ready to stomp on all organic life in the galaxy and Picard is like, 'Hey, we all just need to learn to trust each other. It will be ok.\" I mean who writes this stuff. You have a Borg cube stuck on a planet with androids that have a fast dial to a leviathan level event that would make Lovecraft envious and no one seems to mind.

{"title":"Picard, you are the weakest link! Goodbye.","review":"The oddest thing about this whole arcing set of storylines is that the least interesting character is J-L Picard. If he wasn't there it wouldn't make a difference to the plot outcomes in almost any episode.Why didn't the Producers make it about the Romulans, Alison Pill's scientist or Jeri Ryan's Rangers. An open goal missed. Instead the writers have to make the least active character in the Trek universe front and centre as he slows down even further in to retirement. The idea of using a retiree is interesting but he can barely get out of first gear. Not only that there are multiple love interest sub-plots where the actors have no chemistry at all due to the poor writing.Drivel.","rating":"5\/10","date":"17 July 2022"}
{"title":"No Tuvix and Cogenitor but almost nothing of value either","review":"The two worst Trek episodes of all-time are Tuvix from Voyager and Cogenitor from Enterprise. They are about condoning cold-blooded first-degree murder (done in collaboration with the ship's top-ranked staff) and condoning slavery (with a strong dose of sexism and heterosexism thrown in), respectively. So far, this series hasn't managed to unset those and I don't expect it to. What it does instead is torture the audience with cartoonish banality.This series vies with Discovery and Enterprise for worst Trek series. The final season of Enterprise, with its brain-dead war game plot (featuring Insectoids! And a bunch of other oids) not only had so many bad episodes, it had the Cogenitor episode. So, it's strong competition. Discovery lacks one of the two worst episodes of all-time but is suffocatingly obsessed with its Mary Sue lead, her boyfriend, quick fixes, spelling everything out in capital letters (even more than Enterprise, possibly), predictability, and advertising for the psychotherapy business.Picard is the least Trek-like series I've seen from the franchise, especially season 2. Discovery is so heavy-handed and predictable, especially in its latest season (I think it's season 3 but it's not important as all of the seasons are weak). Enterprise was mostly dull and disappointing throughout. Phaser fight? Check. Brawl? Check. Ship battle? Check. Boring speech? Okay. It also suffered from the cardinal sin of playing games with the personalities of the characters - not being true to character. The way Tripp's attitude was reset after the Cogenitor episode is a classic case of poor production.Picard, as a series, is a pile of clich\u221a\u00a9s, as is Discovery and as was Enterprise before them (for the most part, at least). It tries its hardest to rip off (regurgitate) all of the moments that were memorable in ye olde Trek and fails badly every time. Season 2 has the show especially floundering, not knowing what kind of show it even is in episodes like Monsters. I can't imagine things getting better and had to force myself through that episode.One of the most irritating aspects of this series is its use of sword fighting. It's as if the production staff are intent on trying to siphon every unique aspect from popular franchises, dump them into a pot, stir, and see what floats up. Well, what is floating to the top isn't a great Trek series.","rating":"2\/10","date":"16 April 2022"}

{"title":"W.T.F. Happened?!","review":"I loved the first season of ''Star Trek: Picard''. And that's no small thing considering that, at around the same time, i was also watching great shows like ''The Expanse'', and ''The Boys''. So it makes it all the sadder that season two of ''Picard'' is some of the worst, by the numbers, cliche ridden, barrel-scraping, cookie-cutter garbage that i have seen in decades. And i don't mean that it's just dissapointing compared to season one. That would be understandable. But season two is bad compared to the worst of anything that TV has ever had to offer. And i don't just mean within the Star Trek franchise either, or even within science fiction in general. I honestly and seriously mean that season two of ''Picard'' is one of the very worst things on screen, ever.The very moment i heard that the plot was the team travelling back in time to (more of less) present day L. A. then i instantly cringed. After all, it's not like it's been done before is it? Oh, except by Kirk, and Janeway, and probably others slipping my mind for now. And it's also not like there are any other citys in the world either. We all know that everything happens exlusivly in LA, New York, or at The Whitehouse. There are simply no other locations on Earth (are there Hollywood?)But if that wasn't basic, template writing enough, the second that the team arrive in Earths past one of them gets hurt and rushed to a clinic. From there, i knew for certain that i could tell you almost all of the plot for the next couple of episodes, and half the plot for the rest of the season. He meets a hot nurse, he then seperatly meets her precocious and annoying child, who explains (without much reason) that his mum is currently single, various members of the team get arrested, etc, etc, It's like i'm watching almost any old Trek from the last half a century, and all that's changed is the names and faces. And there is only one small jokey reference to kind of say ''Yes, THIS again''. To be honest, they could have littered season two with those self-deprciating-humour scenes, and turned it into one long bad self-parody. Yes, it would have been like a second rate version of ''The Orville'', but that would still have been a massive improvment on what this is.Because next we get a baddie inside someones head that nobody else can see or hear (done endlessly in ''Farscape'', and WAY better in ''Altered Carbon'' and ''The Expanse''), a whole episode inside Picards mind (not far off the ''it was all a dream'' cliche), and even a damn song! And that's me out. When i somehow get so far into a book, film, or TV series, and still don't have to see the end, that's when i know it sucks. Because IF i've made it past the halfway point, and i can still bail out without even wondering how things go, then it must truly be garbage. And i have only done that about four times in roughly forty-five years. But yes, this gets THAT bad. And from having been so good (I. M. O.) to start with, that must make it one of the biggest, or at least one of the fastest drops in quality in TV history.","rating":"4\/10","date":"24 April 2022"}

{"title":"Not The Worst, Far From The Best of Star Trek","review":"\"The Next Generation\" was my introduction into the world of Star Trek. Captain Jean-Luc Picard was always decisive, always in control, never wrong. He was as close to a living saint in Starfleet as a society without religion can get. So what happens when his halo becomes a little tarnished?It's clear that the United Federation of Planets isn't quite the utopia it once was. A war with the Dominion (Deep Space 9), and skirmishes with the Maquis and Klingons would leave any idealistic society a bit disillusioned. So for someone like Picard, who absolutely holds dear the ideals of the Federation, it makes for an uneasy existence within it now that things have greatly changed.This show, however, begins with a brooding, retired, Admiral Picard who recalls in an interview that he was leading a mission of mercy to rescue and relocate Romulans after their sun had gone supernova when, without warning, androids (synthetics) working on Mars had become murderous. The ships being built there for the relocation were destroyed, and the relocation of the Romulans was brought to an end, much to Picard's dismay. So much so that Picard openly criticizes Starfleet and greatly embarrasses himself in the process.It's at this point we're introduced to Dahj, an android that doesn't realize she's an android until some super secret Romulan agents enter her apartment, kill her boyfriend, and activate her ability to defend herself. As she's running from her apartment she sees an image of Picard and seeks him out.After Picard and Dahj meet, he has a dream in which he sees his friend Data painting a picture. That leads him to Starfleet archives where he finds the painting, and finds out it was painted by Data and is titled \"Daughter\". Picard concludes from this that somehow Dahj and Data are linked together, but before he can find out for certain Dahj is killed by more Romulan agents.Picard eventually goes to the Daystom Institute where he finds out that Dr. Bruce Maddox, who at one time wanted to disassemble Data in order to study and replicate him, believed that it was possible to make a synthetic life form, one that could be confused for being completely human, from a single neuron from Data's positronic matrix. And that such life was made in pairs, meaning that Dahj had a twin who might be in danger.So Picard gives himself a mission: find Dahj's twin, find Bruce Maddox, and protect them from the Romulans. But as he's figuring out exactly how to do that, Starfleet refused to reinstate him and give him a ship. So he forms a ragtag crew made up of people he pissed off, but follow him anyway, and people he picks up along the way, such as Seven of Nine from Voyager, who has now become a vigilante.Along the way they discover what's really going on. A shadow organization behind the Romulan Tal Shiar had learned that several hundred thousands of years ago, artificial life had nearly wiped out all organic life. This organization committed itself to safeguarding the universe from such a threat again. It was this group that had been behind the synthetics attacking Mars, and by extension sabotaging their own rescue. And now, from Dahj's twin sister android Soji, they have learned the location of the planet where these new synthetics are being built. So, for a nearly destroyed empire, they manage to assemble 218 heavily armed warships and deploy them to the planet in order to eliminate the threat that is represented by the synthetics.But the Federation sends a fleet of ships, led by Picard's former first officer Will Riker, shows up. Meanwhile, the synthetics are preparing to defend themselves by summoning the artificial lifeforms that nearly destroyed organic life, that is until Picard gives one of his speeches and Soji shuts down the array that summoned them. But then not long after Picard, who had been suffering from an incurable disease the whole time, ends up dead. But not really because his consciousness was transferred into an android body, so that the show can go on.I liked that Picard showed a broken, disillusioned man who had made some mistakes. I liked that the Federation and Starfleet had changed, and Picard had to deal with that. But what I didn't like is that even when it was revealed that the people Picard was trying to help, the Romulans, were responsible for ending their own rescue, Picard doesn't admit that he was wrong and that Starfleet was right. A people who would put an end to their own rescue and in such a violent way is capable of anything, and Starfleet had a responsibility to the Federation to protect it. But Picard would not concede that, he bought into his own hype and convinced those that joined him that he could not be anything but completely right.The Romulans also, to an extent, were right. If given the opportunity the synthetics could and would destroy all organic life. So their actions, ironically enough, were to protect not only themselves, but the Federation and all the other races of the Star Trek universe. And they even showed themselves not to be the helpless refugees that Picard saw them as, as they assembled an impressive fleet of ships ready to battle the synthetics.When you take a step back, you realize that this definitely isn't The Next Generation. Too much has happened in the world both inside and outside of Star Trek for it to be. So, I applaud the writers and producers for understanding that. But at the same time they make old, brooding, disillusioned Picard someone who, despite being wrong and pissing people off, someone who ultimately can't be wrong, and his self-righteous behavior and even wrong conclusions are simply glossed over. Having to deal with how wrong he had been should have been the way this show went. It ultimately wasn't.","rating":"5\/10","date":"2 April 2020"}
{"title":"This show is absolutely terrible","review":"STTNG took pains to make things seem at least scientifically plausible. This show is a hacked together ball of derivative Star Trek tropes designed to make a show as cheaply as possible. The acting is very bad. Did the original cast members even rehearse their lines? Characters are constantly explaining what's going on, trying to form a storyline where there is none, and most of all, trying way too hard to reunite original characters, and referencing old episodes.From a technical standpoint, the show is passable. The CGI is decent. (I would hope so, this is 2023, not The Wrath of Khan.) Lighting is pretty nice. The sets are obviously the same redressed ST sets we've all seen so many times now.","rating":"3\/10","date":"24 March 2023"}

Nor does the smoking and ( futuristic, I guess ) vaping.Watching the credits I note there are more \"producers\" ( executive, co-executive, consulting, and supervising ) than recurring characters; I have to wonder if making money was more important than telling the story ( certainly not what I believe creator Gene Roddenberry was trying to accomplish ).I WANTED to like it. I remember the original Star Trek ( TOS ) fondly and at least all the later additions to the franchise were watchable.Seven of Nine ( and CDR Data, of course ) was key to the plot; cameos of other TNG characters added little, possibly even detracting.IF you're as big a fan of the Star Trek as I ( still ) am I guess you'll need to watch it.

Meaning 1 point for production, 1 for pacing and 1 out of 2 for strong caracters.Production is not really suprising since if I count the number of producers for this vehicle , it could have been Tribbles.Story was zero points , same for acting ,emotional impact ,original , sympathy with players.Now , season 3 . Somebody has obvious smashed his fist on the table and gladly gotten those writers of their cloud of pot .Story gets 2 points this time , acting 1 .

At a certain point Shaw gives an order , to be overturned by Picard pointing out he is higher ranking and thus gives another order which is accepted by Shaw . Later in the same episode Picard gives an order to be overturned by Riker because he is the acting Captain ! And Picard stands down . Ok boys back to school here .On another occasion they go to this old Space station where Geordi is in charge of kind of a museum where all the old starships are present including a Klingon Bird of Prey . To escape from some enemies two rookies are able to steal the cloakin device of the Klingon ship , place it on their Starship and activate it . So what ??? As if that Klingon ship being there for years and years was never investigated neither the technology was used for the present starships ?

All he can do is lower his head and turn his eyes in two directions.Michelle Hurd as Rafaella : makes me nervous since the last time I saw Danny Kaye perform.The stand-out performer is Brent Spiner.Sol Rodriguez gets points of not overacting.Jonathan Frakes stays true to himself and his caracter , much so Michael Dorn.Most of the rest are overacting and are little convincing.So all in all , a very bad start with a decent ending.Making it 3 point , 3 points and 6 points , or 4 in general.","rating":"4\/10","date":"3 January 2024"}

And the way the way the second season ended I expected to see how things had changed with the Borg and everything they went through but the third season went on like the second season hadn't happened at all I don't understand it and it was very frustrating. The third season treated the Borg the same way they did in the old Star Trek series.

After regretfully watching the first season of Star Trek Discovery, I was really hesitant to give this series any of my attention and I should have paid attention to my gut instincts. Despite many familiar faces and throwbacks, it really doesn't feel like a Star Trek show to me, which defeats the point of watching it. It's a weird amalgamation of unrealistic Matrix like maneuvers combined with a daytime TV soap opera feel. It really seems to lack cohesion and forethought when trying to keep the iconic series going. As crazy and outlandish as TNG seemed at times, it felt grounded in reality. Every aspect of that series was extremely well thought out and actually seemed plausible. It's very hard to believe the characters and their acting in this series and I don't develop any personal connection to any of them.

It's fine if you want to make a Sci-Fi series that is dark and foreboding, but that's simply not what Star Trek is about.This is a kind of Blade Runnery parody\/homage in one of those Star Trek parallel universes that used to crop up in DS9 where things were inverted. Decisions are made that Starfleet would simply never make, poverty abounds where replicators could be used and people swear. Yes, is used in the ST universe.I swear like a trooper in RL and am far from a prude, but I just don't want to hear in in Star Trek, it's out of place.Like Discovery it looks amazing, it's beautifully shot, fabulous effects and music. However, this long, slow arc thing with no individual story week on week is tedious. Babylon 5 got this arc thing spot-on. Yes, have a storyline over the series, but each week, something needs to happen, there needs to be a story happeneing in each episode.They can't even avoid the clich\u00e9 of nasty Brits playing baddies with the casting of the plotting Romulans. They are so tiresome.The best Star Trek since TNG? It's the Orville which transports you back to those glorious times of Juc-Luc, Riker, Data et al. This is just dark, bland nonsense.","rating":"5\/10","date":"18 February 2020"}
{"title":"Nostalgic 5","review":"It was simple, straightforward, it was fast paced, it had strong, well defined characters and and a clear, straightforward story. Sometimes the story was less satisfying but most of the times it was good, and not least, it had an individual story for each episode.\nHaving a storyline that carries on from one episode to another eliminates the new, the invention, the surprising, and has the ability to perpetuate the mistakes and even worse, to wear and tear even the positive aspects that happened to be incorporated in the design.\nI remember watching The Expanse and experiencing a feeling of convoluted and cryptic story (the story on the political environment) and i found again that feeling in the new Star Trek. But i didn't recollect it from the young age watching Star Trek: Next Generation.\nI must say that the craft of good writing seems to have lost its true masters, the true sense of value is lost, deformed, captive into an unhappy symbiosis with the vain.","rating":"5\/10","date":"27 March 2020"}

I mean, do recall these ridiculous episodes from STNG season one, two or three, men in skirts, Wesley all over, BS stories - the point where they really didn't know where they were going with all the ST stuff and made things absurdly stupid. We still loved it. But. They were still stupid.Now Picard is OLD as F. You almost expect him to start drooling. Dialogue is mostly nonsense. But I still want to watch it, even if I mark these episodes \"do not watch ever again\".*Sigh*I guess this will be marginally enjoyable by old fans, all the rest will just skip and watch Expanse again.EDIT:\n3rd season. Finally! Gosh. After nonsensical 1st season and ABYSMAL 2nd season here comes the total makeover. It's some of best TNG\/DS9\/VOY had to offer plus some more action and minus polite and calm demeanor. Yes, it's still \"contemporary\" and dark Star Trek, rather than Roddenberry's vison.

{"title":"Better than Discovery... but not by much.","review":"This show is a HUGE nostalgia cash-in by CBS; plain and simple.Visually; it looks nice yes. And it has Patrick Stewart in it; with some familiar faces. But those are the only redeeming qualities of it. There are traces or hints of the Trek of Old, I.e. Actual inspired Trek that adhere's to Gene's vision. But those moments are ruined by very Discovery-esque cringe moments which are far more frequent. The writing is very 'modern' and that is by no means a complement; I think maybe a sole writer in their writing room had seen some of TNG, First Contact and Nemesis. Nemesis was by no means great; but the horrible retconning of its events is just cringe Discovery writing at its peak.Nothing is believable about Star Trek: Picard.Hell, the so-so MMORPG somehow manages to build a better story and universe than this crap. And videogame writing... especially for an MMO... it's not top notch stuff.","rating":"5\/10","date":"2 February 2020"}
{"title":"Geria-Trek Picard . It's not trek , so why call it that ? All the Pro's anc Cons of episode 1","review":"Geria-trek\nPicard - Season 2There are some actors who have a window(timewise) of opportunity to reprise their hit onscreen role before being abit too long in the tooth to convincing play the character.And sadly the beloved Jean Luc Picard has definitely soured while we waited instead of matured.For those brave enough to continue after season 1 the new seasons hints at \"some\" improvement over season 1 , pros and cons will be placed in turn to balance out this analysis.Pro :\nAn old foe gets a well deserved modern makeover.Yes! The Borg are back and this time they are in-sync with what our modern day technological advancements are. A foe that was trully held back by 90s standards and lack of real life tech , I have always felt that the Borg would be today the most mighty of enemies seeing that they embody the technological threat we fear in today's world , but even more powerful.Con :\nAs with season 1 , the writters have decided to continue with their un-star trek ideals of portraing smoking as the new norm. Of all the terrible decisions made with STP , that of having a cigar smoking captain that acts like a cowboy rather than a starfleet officer should be making poor Gene spin in his grace at warp 9 right now. Not only is it a thousand steps backwards ethically but also completely contradicts the entire franchise and numerous episodes of TNG where picard himself points out the terrible nature of smoking as part of the decadence of the 20th century. Lest we forget even Captain Kirks reaction to the \"filthy habit\".Pro :Q is back!! There he is , in all his glory ! What you need more ? Ok ... Guinan too !! Both being just as you remembered them! Older yes , different no!Con :\nMany parts of the episode are hard to watch without wondering \"Is this serious or is it a star trek parody? \". Indeed a few years ago , many script and story elements would and could only be found in indie star trek parodies , and yet .. here they are .. in the franchise itself.Pro :\nIf you watch the last 20 minutes of the episode only , you might just be tricked into thinking that Star Trek Picard is the worthy continuation of TNG and Star Trek : First Contact. Finally they have got it right and this is going to be great!Con :\nIf you watch the episode from the beggining , you might turn it off before you reach the last 20 mins of find yourself skipping to the end just for Q.Pro :\nIf you are a fan of JJ cinematography , you will be happy.Con :\nIf you expect your favourite Jean luc to return ... don't.Sadly , Patrick Stewart is just not up to the role or character. In all , Star Trek Picard is an ego trip for an actor rather than a reprisal of a memorable and inspirational character. Fans of TNG are confronted with their beloved character behaving in complete opposite to what he did and preached during TNG. A role being played by an actor who appears to have never seen any of the episodes he acted in during the 7 seasons of TNG.From barely walking to romancing his aid like a care home patient , and constantly looking lost like Homer Simpson's father to barely being able to speak , let alone ask the computer to self destruct , Star Trek Picard is well and trully on its way to Geria-Trek Picard.","rating":"3\/10","date":"5 March 2022"}

And Jean-Luc Picard would not have let himself be so easily baited as he did with the news reporter. That was a shameful representation of Star Fleet's finest Captain.Things I liked; well Data's daughter obviously. That is really cool. The show is more bloody and violent than our old Trek was.

{"title":"Gene Roddenberry would have hated this","review":"The show is literally nothing of what Star Trek should be. Star Trek was about how humanity overcame its problems and went out to explore the universe. There was no famine, poverty or violence on earth also in a star trek world, it was a utopia.The appeal of the franchise was that is showed what humanity could be. All I see in this series is that we haven't changed and that it's all hopeless.I feel this is Hollywood trying to make a quick buck and a \"space war series\" is what generates the most buzz.The only thing it gets right is that Picard resigns because Starfleet wasn't the same anymore, I shall follow in those steps and say I won't be watching this abomination anymore as it's not Star Trek. Gene Roddenberry would have hated what Star Trek has become. I am also very surprised that Sir Patrick Stewart (someone who should have understood what the star trek world was) went a long with such a let down.If someone made a Star Trek series in the way it was intended, a series of exploration, diplomacy and inginuity...... they would be the most watched ST series out there.

{"title":"Constant retcons destroy what made things interesting in the first place --- but there are also many pleasing aspects about this show","review":"First of all: This is very emotional for me. I'm born in the very late 1980s and grew up with the 1987-2002 TNG-era Star Trek, as TNG+DS9+VOY had constant reruns on mainstream German TV stations until the late 2000s. So there is nostalgia in play, and nostalgia usually isn't a good reviewer. But a fan's lore knowledge can also help to sort things out.So straight to every fan's most important question: Does the show respect and uphold established Star Trek canon? The answer to this question is: Sort of. Considering the state of Star Trek since 2009, this is a success. And a cornerstone of this success is that a contemporary Trek show made with modern movie tech and a big budget has much less trouble integrating into the Star Trek timeline when it is set 20 years after ST10 like STP rather than 10 years before TOS like STD. That's simply because in a sequel the advancements in production standards can be explained away as in-universe advancements, while a prequel completely destroys suspension of disbelief.And they really tried to link STP to TNG\/DS9\/VOY visually while still appealing to \"the next generation\" of consumers! Let's take LCARS for example: The OS evolved since we last saw it on the small screen in Voyager's Endgame, but you can clearly see it is still LCARS - just after the installation of some updates over the two decades. It's like the evolution of Windows during the last two decades: It changed, but the basic layout and iconography stayed the same. The producers also made sure to provide visual links to established TNG-era elements, like with the items in Picard's exhibition room at the Starfleet Museum, er the esthetics of the replicator or by making the Galaxy class USS Enterprise-D and it 10 forward bar appear.So far there aren't many significant canon contradictions. Okay, in TNG S01E26 Data said that TV didn't last much beyond the year 2040, yet we see TV newscasts and Picard doing a TV interview. But admittedly we already saw a TV newscast in Voyager's series finale \"Endgame\", and I personally can live with such small and infrequent canon offenses quite well. But I can't live with the big ones! Big ones like shuttles from Discovery flying around everywhere while the beautiful TNG-era shuttles were nowhere to be seen! This is a bad artistic decision and it makes no sense canon-wise, as Discovery is set over a century before Picard while Voyager with its beautiful shuttlecrafts is set only 25 years before Picard. Such inconsistencies suck!On the other hand we get much nostalgic balm that will please every fan's soul. We can spot a dermal regenerator in action. We see both TNG-era uniforms - and they look good. We see the communicator that was used in Voyager and the latter half of DS9. We see many recreations of props used in TNG like the Kurlan naiskos, a Klingon bat'leth or the banner from Captain Picard Day. (The original props had been sold as part of the \"It's a Wrap!\" auction, but the recreations look very, very convincing.) We see established alien species like the Trill.A thing that can be noticed quite negatively however is the surprisingly cheap looking VFX. Enterprise-D's ten forward can easily be recognized as digital set, the shot of San Francisco's bay area looks like from a 2000s Syfy channel movie and the CGI model of the Enterprise-D looks inferior to his physical counterpart(s) from the 80s\/90s where real light was hitting real surfaces. (TNG aged very well and it is hard to live up to its standards!)But the worst thing is the horrible writing. The first episode has a clear jumping the shark moment where massive hack writing is setting in. You will immediately realize what I mean when watching the show. The first 40 minutes of the series are making it quite clear that we can expect an unrealistic as well as contradicting storyline full of plot holes. And yes, I'm positive about this after the first episode.","rating":"5\/10","date":"30 January 2020"}

{"title":"Come for the premise, stay for Stewart","review":"It seems like a lot of people think the creators are doing their damnedest to destroy the legacy of star trek as a whole, and I just can't agree with that. People don't usually set out to make something bad or mediocre.I myself am not a fan of neither Voyager or Enterprise, but I can appreciate what they were trying to do.Like with Discovery, the team trying something new, and it's not working. Not for me, and not for a whole lot of the audience. I do commend them for trying, and I think it's unnecessary to attack them over it.That being said, I find that a lot of the characters aren't fleshed out enough, and the writing isn't always great. Romantic relationships just kind of manifest out of nowhere, and motivations change on a whim. There's an exploration of past trauma that I find to be presented very oddly, and doesn't have the resonance I think the writers were hoping for.There's also the inclusion of some humor that, for me at least, falls really flat.The music and a lot of the camera work is great, and the actors are really giving it their all.Patrick Stewart's age reveals itself whenever there's an action scene (and there are many). The man is 80 years old and surrounded by a bunch of actors under 60, so this isn't surprising.But when they let him stand still or sit down, or walk at a normal pace, his monologues and dialogues capture your attention and holds onto it. He is, as he always has been, an acting powerhouse, and I'm really sad that I'll probably never get to see him on stage.I heard rumors that originally, this show was gonna be Picard living at the vineyard with his dog, and solving petty squabbles in the local community.I would have much preferred that version, and I know I'm not alone in that.Give the show a chance if you love Trek, but if you're anything like me, you'll be sticking around for Stewart.","rating":"4\/10","date":"22 February 2023"}
{"title":"Is this Star Trek? Or virtue signalling I want my old star trek back","review":"Season 1 is ok, Season 2 is just an excuse to virtue signal about everything especially social politics with little sensible story line or plot. Season 3 gets better but season 2 destroys it as a Star Trek legacy. This is the worst of the recent Star Trek series, they all moved away from the essence of Star Trek and became more about social politics and making social and political points relevant to today not the future. The odd thing is the new characters are ok and make good additions but the legacy characters like Picard & Seven of Nine bare little resemblance to their original characters, they have been made to be of this current time period rather than one of the future. Season 2 makes the worst hash up of time and causality, the storyline ignores logical conclusion with the get out of Q but it makes no sense either the Borg are the Borg or the borg were changed but neither just ignore logic science or any previous series and storylines so ling as they get to make the social political points to hell with Trekkies and their enjoyment. I recommend watching season 2 with your finger on fast forward you can skip at least 3\/4 and probably enjoy it more unless your not a Trekkie, in which case you probably won't notice anything as most series now spend more time telling you what to think rather than entertaining you and giving you questions to reason with and come to Thank god I never got my kids into it Star Trek the new Series have moved to telling what to think rather than challenging your thoughts.

{"title":"Did all the money go to hiring Patrick Stewart?","review":"I have been thinking I needed to write a review for anyone who might not have seen the show, then felt I needed to even more when I saw the 8+ rating on IMDB. However, the first few reviews I see here seem to be in the same vein.The first episode was quite good... the second was weaker... and then I started wondering if all the money went into hiring Patrick Stewart and making a great first episode. Admittedly, I have seen neither Enterprise nor Star Trek: Discovery because I did not hear good reviews about them, but I had hoped that with this show the producers of Star Trek would have been past hiring actors that can't act (I won't be specific because I realize they are real people); they obviously aren't. It also seems that they can't afford decent writers, because twice in the first three shows I saw a dialogue contrivance of character A earnestly submitting a shocking idea, character B scoffing at the idea, and then effectively saying, \"you're serious?\" as character A maintains the earnestness. There was also the shockingly bad confession after \"can you keep a secret\", and the relationship between Narek and his sister is painfully laughable.Both Allison Pill and Patrick Stewart have been given material that they must be wincing at. I know Allison Pill is a good actress, but it would be very difficult to tell just from this show; she must be a diehard Trek fan to have taken on this role. And Patrick Stewart must be wondering what he got himself into after the promising first episode descended into episodic TV. For a show that is about one story arc, they needed to not cheat the fans and simply turn it into a miniseries featuring only the number of episodes needed to tell the story. This show has gone downhill in a hurry.","rating":"4\/10","date":"20 February 2020"}

I don't know if I'm spoiled but it's not enough of everything for me.Do you know that feeling when you're looking forward to a game, it's coming out, you think it's cool, but it seems unfinished? The episodes in Picard are too empty for their length and that makes the seasons of only 10 episodes all the worse. It's like currency reform - you only get half as much but it costs more. It's like they've been too lazy or too impatient to decorate the episodes with enough plot but still have to stretch everything out to 10 episodes. TNG episodes were just as long, but despite the main plot, each episode was a whole story and so much of it that after each episode you felt as satisfied as if you had watched a whole movie. It's like this development in the gamer scene. You get a bit of the main game, later a DLC, etc. All in bits and pieces but not too much - you could have fun after all.It's enjoyable, but if you are looking forward to rich filled episodes you might feel let down.","rating":"5\/10","date":"23 April 2022"}

{"title":"Great fan service! But, Picard is a shell of himself.","review":"As a person who grew up on STTNG, I have mixed emotions about what to say about Picard. One the one hand, there is very good fan service going on here with lots of cameos from TNG actors, and even several that are regulars, plus regular callbacks to themes and stories from the original TNG series. If you've wanted to see that crew in action again, you get it here, partially. Quality varies greatly episode to episode, and season to season, some are much better than others, with Season 3 being the best. But what really detracts from this series is the main character himself. Picard is a shell of his former self. He is now a greatly dimished and feeble looking and sounding old man, unfortunately. There is just no hiding it. He is hunched and weak, always out of breath, and the delivery of his dialogue is strained and forced. Like the famous episode from TNG where he says \"THERE ARE FOUR LIGHTS!\" All of his lines are delivered with the same forced feeble stacatto. There are some good moments, especially in Season 3 as mentioned, but it's just not the way you want to remember the Picard. I give a 5 for all the fan service, but only a 5 because it kind of ruins your memory of a great character.","rating":"5\/10","date":"10 August 2023"}
{"title":"You should skip Season one & two and just watch Season three","review":"Note: My rating is an average for all three seasons, where season 3, in my opinion, is the best (7\/10).Star Trek Picard continues down the path of serialised television, like Star Trek Discovery.Unfortunately, season one and two suffers from poor storyline decisions, bad writing and poor episode pacing (where in some episodes, the plot hardly moves, due to padding), to enable the writers to tell their story over the 10 episodes for the season.Season three is a significant improvement, thanks to Terry Matalas being promoted to showrunner. Whilst not a perfect season, a good overall story, good writing and pacing.If you are trying to decide on whether to watch Season 1 & 2, if love Star Trek Discovery then you will probably like Season 1 and 2.Good luck!","rating":"5\/10","date":"21 April 2023"}
{"title":"Lacks good writing and an ensemble cast","review":"The first season was not promising but we've all seen the first season of ST:TNG so I was willing to see where this went. Sadly, nowhere good. Inexplicably, this seems to be a vanity piece for Patrick Stewart, and the rest of the cast are left with scraps, which is not the ensemble work that has served Star Trek so well. The wonderful Alison Pill is the only cast member whose performance transcends the terrible material. Patrick Stewart does not look or sound well and seems barely able to deliver his lines. Brent Spiner provided some much-needed spark in Season 2. I understand most of the cast will not appear in Season 3 and I imagine there was a stampede to be the first out the door. The creation of this series was a mistake and a terrible way to remember Patrick Stewart in the title role.","rating":"4\/10","date":"6 May 2022"}

Time travel, breaking the timeline , parallel universe, one person to be rescued, the car driving scene, the bus scene, interacting with police.

{"title":"Such a polarizing series!","review":"It's hard to recall such a polarizing series as Star Trek: Picard (S01, 10eps, 1hr, CBSAA). How can anyone read these reviews and determine whether to watch or not with so many 1s and 10s and little in between?! It's very reminiscent of and has the rhythm of STNG. Patrick Stewart, showing his 80+ years, is one of almost ten EPs but also stars. Though he was run out of Starfleet, this is a very fawning treatment of Picard (and certainly by extension Patrick Stewart). I mean this show is designed to adore and deify him and that really takes away from its appeal. There's a large scale intergalactic story happening here, and as such with his hastily cobbled together rag-tag crew recalls the original Star Wars trilogy - there are definite similarities. A few more things I didn't like: there was a fight scene in ep3 that was just stupid with an unarmed Picard and other unarmed colleagues beating back an attack of armed\/trained Romulans, so that was a scene-fail. The repeated treachery AND forgiveness of Agnes Jurati, then, the season finale was epic but feels like three episodes edited into one which kind of ruined it - seriously, key people die then are immediately resurrected with no complications\/ill-effects, etc. Probably the biggest disappointment is that the predetermined protags-must-prevail trope was so obviously done just dispensing with any realistic conflict. The finale could've and should've been GREAT but it marched to a Disney-patented good-guys-prevail ending and then there's all of the social justice signaling\/indoctrination which we're all just so over. I started to watch S02 but it's just more Picard fantasy porn. Other misc stuff, you'll see some of your favorite STNG characters return glad-handing Picard in good 'ole reunion style (so annoying), but they've aged and gotten fat.","rating":"5\/10","date":"29 May 2020"}
{"title":"Will not be remembered","review":"Overall, this show is a huge disappointment especially seasons 1 and 2. The first two seasons are preachy and woke ideological with horrible characters and actors filling those rolls.Then we come to the third season where things improve but how do they do that? They bring back a whole lot of Remember Berries! Names, events, aliens, ships and more are either mentioned or heavily dropped into each episode; most of all, they bring back the TNG cast.From most of the 10 star reviews you can tell people have been pleasantly tickled by the amount of nostalgic references and gloss over the terrible acting and empty stories. Even with season three's improvements, episodes of Picard will be forgotten, nothing about them are original or compelling.","rating":"4\/10","date":"13 March 2023"}
{"title":"Went expecting the worst. It's actually quite good.","review":"So, far. Full disclosure here. I'm a Trekkie. Straight from the 70's. That's when I found Trek. For me DS9 was my fav. But, I really loved TNG. Do I have an issue with Picard's current state. Sure. That's not the Picard we knew. He never would of allowed himself to waste away on his vineyard. But, the reality of real world economics and lack of will with Paramount or CBS til now gets us to where we are. Lines like Starfleet was no longer Starfleet is not what Roddenberry would of allowed. Kinda of funny that when he goes to San Fran there's Starfleet and it looks pretty cool. I have high hopes for future of story. If, they can swerve out of the PC culture and \"Woke\" bs it has a good chance. Give it a chance. Definitely, better than the awful Discovery.","rating":"4\/10","date":"4 February 2020"}
{"title":"Flawed, but still good.","review":"Picard is not flawless. It isn't deserving of a 9 or a 10. Questionable 8 at most. This isn't entirely fan service as well, although there is certainly elements of that.No, this is a journey telling the last voyage of Picard. The show has a somewhat interesting if shaky premise that's been a familiar trope in sci-fi for sometime now; the idea that AI will, eventually, rise up and revolt.And that there is a mysterious faction at work that zealously hates and distrusts AI, but their goal seems to go deeper than that.Problem with Picard isn't so much of an overused trope or the premise, but the writing and setup of the supporting cast. My issue isn't with their acting capability; if anything, its generally decent and acceptable.The issue is the characters themselves and how they were written. I really dislike the idea of a 'samurai' romulan wielding a sword and being utilized for his skills. We are supposed to believe that this singular romulan individual grew up to be a remarkable swordsman simply because Picard spent a few minutes fencing with the young lad.Then there's the attack by the secret romulan cell on Picard himself and Data's daughter. In one scene, we see Picard and his friends at his Chathour viewing remarkable security footage of the first incident, despite apparently leaving no evidence behind (and not making it clear how they got this footage) which also leaves a glaring big massive plot-hole as to why Picard didn't show this amazing clear footage of an attack to Star Fleet intelligence when he had the chance.For a secret romulan cell, they seem quite incompetent at taking out an old man and a pair of talented and skilled former intelligence operatives (but only two of them) not to mention leaving behind a trail of evidence, bodies and weapons which I no doubt, will not find their way towards Star Fleet intelligence because, well, because the plot demands that it doesn't.Picard is by no means without its flaws. Its marred by 21st Century tropes and writing habits that some of these writers seem to be having an issue leaving behind some old habits.I just hope the rest of the scene is an improvement upon what I've seen so far.","rating":"2\/10","date":"14 February 2020"}

{"title":"Very Disappointed","review":"I have been a long time fan of star Trek and have basically liked all the series related to the original franchise, but Picard is unfortunately, in my opinion, bit worthy of being in the Star Trek family.I had a lot of expectations, Picard is arguably the best captain in any of the series, and with him and part of the original crew involved this could have been a hit.The first problem is that it is extremely slow. The 10 episodes in season 1 could have been very adequately been done in 3. The rest is simply forgettable filling.\nThe second problem is that it somehow feels disconnected from classical star trek narrative, in terms of the way the episodes are set up.\nThird there are a couple of opportunities for intense action, but they are simply not used. The most iconic one is the final confrontation with the Romulans, Nearly 400 ships ready to fire, no shots taken, completely missed opportunity for an amazing battle scene. While at the same time they show these awkward, unimaginative looking, robotic tentacles starting to emerge from a space time hole that was created, very a la Avengers. They did not look good, at all, and the scene could have gone elsewhere, with more action and getting you much more involved.\nClassic Picard characters are not bad, new characters are good too, but the feeling I had after watching the whole season was that it was an opportunity not fully taken.If there is a second season hopefully they will change the shows direction, and make it more involving and use the opportunities it presents to engage the viewer in more intense action. If it does not get better, there surely will be no third season and Picard, one of the greatest names in Star Trek legacy will have a bad ending to it.","rating":"5\/10","date":"29 November 2020"}

I like the episodic story-telling of Star Trek, so if we rammed all the first eight episodes in the first five minutes (easy) and then continued with the last two episodes of Season 1, it actually would take on the feel of TNG in which Picard excelled (and, please, get rid of the swear words -- there's not many, admittedly, but for heaven's sake, surely we can have a few cutting edge series without swear words, also it's so very not Star Trek, not very twenty-fourth century. I want kids to enjoy it, without making it kiddish, but being able to include kids in watching it for the role models and the innovation and optimism.)FYI at the time of this review, Season 2 (if any) had not started yet.","rating":"3\/10","date":"23 December 2020"}

I've always enjoyed Star Trek and this was an opportunity to update the franchise and get some interest in future films. Season one was ok, season two was mildly entertaining but season three is absolute garbage. I'm finding it hard to actually watch. The script is the worst part, nothing makes sense, the characters decision making is completely unbelievable. The things they do don't make sense and wouldn't have been possible within the federation. They've brought back characters from TNG for no reason and they add little to the story. Poor Beverley looks likes she's been living with the Son'a. It could have been so much fun, but instead it's so so disappointing.","rating":"4\/10","date":"15 March 2023"}

It would have been better to see our heroes age gracefully and then give them the decent writing they deserve. Picard not accepting death in Season 2 was bad. Dropping F bombs in Season 3 is not Star Trek. Worf got a decent part at least. Also too much of moder Life is re hashed. The music, \" words like\"pot\", ugh. Plenty of SFX though. The story is consistently fragmented, weak, and cliche.

{"title":"It still beats Star Wars","review":"I liked it for the first few episodes but then it kind of changed.Let me get this out of the way first. It's difficult to talk about this for some reason. Even though they shove it in your face continuously I guess you're just supposed to ignore it. It is a very \"diverse\" cast. The problem here is the writers of Star Trek don't understand what diversity is. It feels much more like forced diversity than anything and it does detract from the story. For example, Benjamin Sisko, Kathryn Janeway, Beverly Crusher, Guinan, Deanna Troi, Warf, Seven of Nine, Kira Nerys, Uhura, etc. were all great characters but it never felt like they were there to fill a diversity quota. In Picard I got much more off a diversity quota vibe.Okay, with that out of the way. It started off not half bad. After episode four I thought it was going to be a good show, perhaps even a little mind-bending. But no. It's just kind of a weak story. Episode 9 might as well have been a soap opera. They kinda stole from Battlestar Galactica with Soji and Narek. Alison Pill is boring and trying to hard to portray emotions. Raffi is 100% hollow as a character. ...there's a lot of crying, lol. It's just generally not very good.This pretty much killed Star Trek for me.One last thing. I guess this would be the spoiler. I thought they were going to go deep with the mind bending stuff. In episode 3 Picard beams up but it seemed different than the thousand other beam ups I've seen. Maybe I just imagined it differently but it didn't seem like he was beaming up to the ship. It felt more like the Matrix. Then there is the Borg plot line. Finally, in the opening credits the sky turns into something physical as though it's telling you that reality is not what you think. Okay so with all that in mind I was hoping for some new ideas or a mind bending plot. But in the end, nope. Picard just gets his mind uploaded to a computer.","rating":"5\/10","date":"27 March 2020"}

{"title":"Tried very hard to like it.","review":"Star Trek Picard started out all right for the first episode. By the 2nd episode, it started to become obvious that this was never going to be as good as the Star Trek shows and movies between 1966-2005.Firstly, the writing was all over the place, and the story was, for the most part, superficial to non-existent. So many sub-plots were never followed up with or clarified, and questions were left unanswered. Writers magic was used in so many cases where a more dedicated person would have thought things out sensibly. For example, the 'imagination tool'. Also, the situation surrounding the federation's fall were not on par with what the Star Trek universe lore had set up already, and the only way it could have fallen that way was if people from today took over the future and ran it with today's knowledge. Some of the decisions they made were completely ridiculous, and made it seem like somehow the Star Trek universe lost most of its intelligence since Voyager returned from the Delta Quadrant. It was just a complete mess.Secondly, the acting was unconvincing. They were just going through the movements of an unbelievable story. They obviously didn't believe it and are clearly rooted in today's world instead of Star Trek's. I didn't care for any of the characters, and found most of them to be unlikable. Even Picard was a shell of his once interesting self, not the strong leader he once was. The actor who played Data was the best of the bunch when he played Data, but was also unlikable when he played human roles.Thirdly, excessive swearing was difficult to take serious after Star Trek set 40 years of good storytelling, showing a future that had evolved from excessive swearing, or didn't use it at all, and opted to be diplomatic and intellectuals instead. In Picard we had juvenile foul-mouthing in most every episode. In fact, it ruined the whole series and completely took me out of it right from episode 2 when it was first used.Fourthly, the show-runners were laying heavily on the nostalgia card, betting on name dropping, and character pop-ups from former series. This alone was the first indication to me that they knew they didn't have a story. By the end of the season it turned out nostalgia was the only real card they had to play. It felt like they were patronizing fans and insulting their intelligence with this, and even that turned into a waste since it didn't help a trash-heap story at all.Lastly, it was obvious they were doing their best to hold back political correctness as much as they could (probably from backlash in Discovery), but it still kept creeping in. They let it ruin much of the Star Trek lore, and now it's clear they're ready to come out with it in full force for season 2, which is poised to be another aimless season that they'll make up on the fly, or possibly plagiarize.This isn't Star Trek.Star Trek is about a future to strive for, and to aspire to be like - better than ourselves today. But every movie and show since the finale of the Enterprise show in 2005 has completely ignored this, and Picard is no different. We are presented with a darker future, one that is not inspiring, or even worth striving for. It's now the opposite, and makes me want to fight any future like that from arriving.I gave it 10 episodes, and after the disappointment wore off and after gathering my thoughts over the last 2 months, I've decided I will not watch another episode of this. Even though Picard is not as bad as Discovery, it's the second worse Star Trek series created, and the second Star Trek series that doesn't interest me at all.What i wanted was a thought-provoking and intellectually stimulating show, depicting a future worth striving for, wanting to visit. Possibly in stand-alone episodes so they could be watched in any order. I ended up getting an uninteresting soap-opera wannabe, set in a future i don't care about, that heavily mirrors current political correctness insanity, and that i don't want to see any more of.0\/10-------------------------- Season 2:I ended up watching the entire series over a few days after hearing it was cancelled. My suspicion of season 2 was wrong. Season 2 was a little bit better.It had a somewhat good story arc involving Q, the Borg Queen, Picard's family, him falling in love, and time travel back to 2024.There's more cameos, and some really nice scenes. The series was better than season one, but don't get your hopes up, because it drags, wastes time and has useless side-plots. I had to watch the season at 1.5 to 2.0 speed.4\/10-------------------------- Season 3:This time they rode nostalgia again, but did manage to pull off a somewhat entertaining, if not horribly disjointed, season.It was all over the place, with Shapeshifters, Borg, and featured a lot of the original TNG cast. The original cast had a great reunion in this season, which made it a bit better.But aside from some nice scenes, it was still the same kind of useless side plots and bad decisions, and swearing, and it completely ignored season 2. The ho-hum ending was a mix-match of things you've seen before.5\/10------------------------- Overall:Picard had a horrible start, was plagued with bad, silly, and aimless storytelling, with too many loose ends. It felt like it was always falling apart, unsure of the universe it was set in. But there is a faint glimmer of Trek in season 3 (and 2) if you can see beyond all that.Overall: 3\/10.","rating":"3\/10","date":"27 December 2023"}

{"title":"In the 24th century......","review":"We return in Picard to the time of TNG, more than 20 years after Nemesis, Voyager and Deep space nine. It's the latter that Picard really takes its dramatic queues from, and thankfully to great effect.Indeed this end of century Federation is a place made out of the strife of that war, the destruction of Romulus and how these events have worn on the steadfast optimism of our favourite captain. In true allegorical style, much like the last 20 years of war have worn on all of us.Picard is tending the family vineyard when we catch up with him, rebuilt where his brother and nephew died in a house fire years before. He's reserved (if he could be any more so) protective even. Weary of days spent tending to his crops and employees (though a pair of extremely funny and charming romulans).Enter Dahj (The absolutely perfectly cast Isa Briones). A woman who seemingly 'knows' him, deeply. She will in fact be the catylist for what will pull him out of his comfortable retirement, on to an adventure that will bring him to face what's left of the romulans, his demons with the Borg and finally his regret in loosing his dearest friend, Data.Kurtzman, Goldman, Chabon and Beyer respected the hell out of everything that came before in this one without bogging it down in a thousand references that the uninitiated would need a fan wiki for. From the opening shot of the 1987 enterprise D to a bar sign that reads 'Quarks' on a lawless planet somewhere in the fringes.There are genuine moments of real depth and feeling. The way Picard describes Data in a conversation with Dahj would move anyone, even without context. Every actor fully committed. In particular Allison Pill goes through an amazing if somewhat torturous arc, and Santiago Cabrera will surprise everyone with his range.If you were expecting TNG 2.0, this isn't it. If there's one thing star trek has shown us, it's that although it really never changes, it can also never go back. It was the first 'shared universe' and each story into the future progressed and changed with all of us. Right now this Picard is meant for us, to show the way and hopefully grow along the journey. After all;What we leave behind is not as important as how we've lived.","rating":"2\/10","date":"4 August 2020"}

It's not like 20 years ago where things are hazy or 20 years in the future and who knows, maybe? It is 2024 and there are few similarities with how things are in LA. I have little regard for the French Defense System but surely they would see a ship from space land in their territory, right? They didn't even kick on the cloaking device and when they did it was an afterthought while they were sitting there on the ground.The big break in to the Gala required the science lady to . . . Sing? Can't say exactly how that happened as I was going in and out of consciousness by then.Why is Renea so hot? That would have been a woke move I could get behind. All members of Starfleet are hawt apparently. She could have been a homely shrew.I came here today because Picard 2 is getting worse and worse and it seems by the ep reviews it is going to keep going. Not sure I am going to make it. May have to jump to Season 3.Would recommend to watch just before you want to go to bed. Better than medicating yourself and achieves the same effect.Right now I am at 3 of 10 and a great Season three might raise it to 5 of 10.***Edit - You can watch Season 3 without 1 and 2, you should***Finished Season 3 yesterday. The entire S3 is all 6s and 7s. There is nostalgia and you will enjoy it if you have watched THG.I truly believe if you watch S2 it makes S3 less. That should never happen in a series. It calls into question everything that happened in S2. It is a big Why?I think if you skip all of Season 2 you will enjoy S3 far more. It actually had a decent plot. Picard's son could be an interesting future character.Anyway, overall it didn't even approach great and relied too much on nostalgia, which I did fall for.","rating":"4\/10","date":"24 May 2023"}
{"title":"I had high hopes but alas it was not to be","review":"When I first heard of Star Trek Picard I was excited for some old fashioned sci fi of exploring strange new places to seek out new life and new civilisations and to have a different story\/objective each week to get lost in whatever story it happened to be BUT rather than a different story each week it's a continuation from the previous week building up to a finale in the 10th episode.....I got bored a few episodes in on series 1 and bored after episode 1 of series 2 I really wanted to like it, at least if you have a different story each week and you get an episode or two that's a bit weak it doesn't really matter but when the whole series is one long story those weak episodes really hurt the series as a whole, I gave 5 stars mainly because it's great to see characters from my childhood back on the screen but with regards to story lines and the series as a whole I'm really disappointed in both series I should have stopped watching after series 1 ended as that was hard enough to get through.","rating":"5\/10","date":"30 April 2022"}

{"title":"season 2 was a dream","review":"I really liked \"PICARD\" season 1 & season 2. The \"over the top\" acting of Patrick Stewart in all 3 seasons is laughable. However, the appearance of the \"BORG\" in season 3 completely ignores the \"rebirth\" of the \"BORG\" in season 2. I have always loved \"Star Trek\" since the original season produced by \"DESI LU\" studios. This season of \"Picard\" is nothing but a reunion of the characters with no \"soul\". Very disappointing for \"trekies\" and a waste of time for me. If you setup an outline for a 3 season series, follow the outline and do not completely forget the previous season. This is a waste of the talent, even the the disappointing \"acting\" of \"admiral jean-luc pecard\".","rating":"5\/10","date":"19 April 2023"}
{"title":"It's growing on me","review":"At the time I reviewed this the show has a solid rating of 7.9. Admittedly I wasn't all that won over by the first few episodes as I thought the show had a bit of a slow start, but it is growing on me and now I can't wait to see how S1 endsReading a few reviews it's pretty clear many purists simply don't like the feel of the show, that it's not true to form ST, darker and abandoning it's principles. While I always loved Star Trek, there was always a side of me that thought it was just a bit pompous and overly self righteous, and that it didn't get itself dirty enough, obviously that's not a problem with Picard. I know part of the cleanliness of the previous shows was probably to do with Roddenberry and his utopian beliefs, and maybe also to do with the fact that they were on cable, but Picard being on CBS All Access, they can be more graphic and drop F bombs all they like. I know some people may strongly disagree with this and say it's too foul for kids, but personally I've never found ST to be much of a kid show to begin with. So overall I welcome the darker and quite frankly more earthbound feel to itAs far as the story itself, I'm glad it's about something different, not centered around a specific ship or station, but more free reigns to just follow a story line wherever that goes. However, that said I'm wondering if this particular story arc about Synths vs Romans will continue on into S2 which I think would wear thin, or wrap up at the end of S1, and if so, then what's in store for S2? It's kind of funny how the Orville blatantly copied so many ST things, except machines rising up against organics and yet Picard is building off a very similar arcAnd then there's the aspect of Picard's brain condition, which we finally see symptoms of, and a 79 year old Patrick Stewart playing the role, and as good as he still is you have to wonder how long this thing could go? Sure they could conjure up some miracle cure, but given the name of the show is Picard, it really is revolving around him and he's the glue holding this whole thing together. I can't think of any series show where the main lead is almost 80 years old, so I guess time will tell there.As far as reusing old ST cast members, this feared me a bit as it usually makes for lackluster episodes or future developments, and typically serves to just give some screen time to someone who's over the hill. That said I'm glad about Jeri Ryan's appearance in the show and don't mind a bit if she becomes a supporting regular as she's still got it. I really hope we don't see any more of Marina Sirtis as she's just not aging well, that and I never liked her pointless character in the first place. Far as Franks, I prefer him behind the camera instead of in front of it. I did like seeing Hue again even if it was brief. Overall I hope they don't have too many more reunionsTo sum up, yeah I thought it started a little slow, but I can see why, good stories take time to build. But things started to pick up in the middle episodes and as we got more into the third act I'm intrigued to see how things are going to end for S1. I really hope they don't screw up the ending, I guess we'll see8\/10","rating":"2\/10","date":"22 March 2020"}

{"title":"Started Out Fine....","review":"The Good= At last a Post Star Trek Nemesis Project that I actually liked when it comes to Star Trek Projects (Duh). Because to be Perfectly Honest every Star Trek Project that came out after Nemesis it's not all that good in my personal opinion. And hare's my mini reviews for each. Star Trek (2007) at the time I was totally confused because JJ Abrams the creator of the Chris Pine Star Trek Films, said that it's supposed to take place in an Alternate Timeline but not Huh? Aside from that it just felt a little too much like Star Wars to me. And I've already made a Review in hare for Star Trek Into The Darkness or as I like to call it Star Trek II The Wrath Of Khan Remake. And as for Star Trek Beyond I think it's the Best out of this Trilogy of Films. And even then it's really largely forgettable but enjoyed the closing scene. Then as for Star Trek Lower Decks, it feels a little too much like Family Guy or Futurama but with a Star Trek Skin. And I already made a Review in hare for Star Trek Discovery right hare on IMDB. And as for Star Trek Prodigy, quit simply way too childish for my tastes. And Finally as for Star Trek Strange New Worlds to be honest I completely lost interest in it after the Third Episode. And aside from that one character the one that kind of looks like a punk, feels more like a Fan doing one of those Fan Experience at a Star Trek and or Sci Fi Convention, than an actual character.Anyways back to Star Trek Picard I really think the Show stared Strong and Deferent from your usual Hares The Starship for the Show and Hare's all of the Characters for the show now let's go on adventures type of Star Trek Show. Instead it tells a cohesive story for each season. I like how in the First Season it shows that not everything was all Hunky Dory like you might expect it to, and it was also nice to see two actors from my all time favourite Star Trek Show Star Trek Voyager. Show up and even better one of them was a main character in Picard like they was on Star Trek Voyager.Then there is that Season One Finally wow that was not only crushing to me Personally but, more importantly I thought it was a great conclusion to a Certain Character. And moving on to Season Two I admit not all of the points hit but I found it more often than not it was a well rounded season. Even thou I'm not happy with the whole season being basically Back To The Future. But in either case just like with the First Season the Season Finally for Season Two was also Pretty Solid in my opinion. And unless I'm Forgetting anything else that should do it for the Positives.The Bad= Most of my Problems Lay in the still going Third Season Currently. At Point Of Review. To start off I feel that the Trailer lied a little as to regards of getting some scenes in the light. And so far I just feel that the First Three Episodes of the Final Season ONLY had Scenes in the Dark. So Dark in fact I've just simply given up due to. Me having some Game Of Thrones Final Season flashbacks.Next is I feel that the USS Titan is way too Durable, I mean a wreckage of an another ship was literally hurled right at them. And on top of that the USS Titan was constantly under attack since the Second Episode of the Season, by another Ship that was Stronger and I think More Advanced than the USS Titan. And of course it goes with out saying they never got the chance to retreat nor hold a proper meet to see if they could come up some kind strategy and maybe repair the ship before going in for the next round. And not only that some one on Board even tried blow the Ship to High Heavens. Although the Bomb did go off but the Ship was not only fine but also still in one piece. And keep in mind that was a relatively large Explosion.And I really didn't like the direction that they took Raffi for this final season of Picard. And speaking of Raffi I'm really disappointed that they did not at least that I know of capitalized on her and 7 Of 9's Friendship from Season Two. And as for the 'Big Bad' for this season she's so hidden for most of the time I just simply don't care her nor about the big mystery which also doubles as this final season's story. I'm mean I didn't even care about the Star Trek TNG Characters that I'm used to and in a way grew up watching from of course Star Trek The Next Generation (TNG) nor about there relationships with one another on Picard. And if you can't even do that in my opinion you've Failed Miserably. And Lastly all of the Original characters from the First Two Seasons of Picard seems to have disappeared with out even a mention. Aside from of course Raffi. And unless I'm Forgetting anything else that should do it.Final Thoughts= As far as Shorts go for The Physical Release of the First Season of Star Trek Picard. I love I thought it was touching even though it was maybe a Fifteen Minute or so short, they really make you feel something for each of the two characters in that short, and by the I don't know the title of it. The only thing I wished they gave was a little bit more back story for both of those two kids in the short, in terms of their past with one another.","rating":"4\/10","date":"10 March 2023"}

And, the VFX this time round were awful.Star Trek is unique, you replace the crew and ship - You still get Star Trek. (Think, The Orville and Galaxy Quest). But, if I replaced the crew here (I wouldn't even need to replace the ship because it's so generic in design) - You could of told me it was a new IP, and a bad one at that. Really generic. Somehow wrote the same story as Discovery.I saw this in the comments on a YouTube video, felt it sums the show up well.Kurtzman: \"So we're ripping off Mass Effect and I want the Romulans to be Quarians who hate AI.\"\nChabon: \"But that's not how it's ever been in Star Trek.\"\nKurtzman: \"What's Star Trek?\"","rating":"3\/10","date":"28 March 2020"}

The 3rd season totally contradicts the 2nd. Steward is way to old. He can barely talk. Time to move on. The last season had to be one of the worst seasons along with any discovery. The good part is Strange new world redeems them for these failures. Lower decks grows on you. Picard does the exact opposite more you watch the worst it gets.

{"title":"Meh","review":"Yes I agree with a lot of reviewers that this isn't really Star Trek, but the first season was very good. The only thing I would change is for it to be less graphic in places. It's well written and the actors are great. It is 10 times better than Star Trek discovery. What I dislike about both shows Is that the sets look more like a shopping mall than star ship cabins. (Actually there's a lot I dislike about Discovery but I won't go into that here.)Second season update: this show has gotten much worse. It's low on story and high on an endless flurry of meaningless events. There are these random brief pauses where there's a clumsy attempt at a story and the one-dimensional characters pour out their \"feelings\", then there is another string of violent, disjointed, yet boring scenes. It's really a very ham-handed and badly-written script.Watch Star Trek Strange New Worlds instead. The first season is very good anyway.","rating":"3\/10","date":"14 March 2020"}

I've watched every Star Trek episode from TOS, TNG, DS9, & VOY probably half a dozen times each-this I couldn't even make it past the pilot.

{"title":"It has it's good points.","review":"I think maybe the negative criticisms for this series are too harsh, (and I gave Discovery a 1* rating, and bashed the crap out of it, in my review). I do see the points people are making though, and more or less agree with them. But I also have been enjoying some of those same things, about this series.Anyways, let me just address a few of the things, I've seen other reviews complaining about.Dark: I do hate the new trend of tv shows being dark, in general. And this definitely suffers from that. Not only the story is dark, but also the visuals.As far as dark visuals go, that is never good, (i.e. the CW look) and it's not good here either.As far as a dark story goes, it can go either way. I do kind of like it here (unlike most others). I feel I can relate to Picard's darkness. I'm getting pretty old myself. Things I was once cheery about, just feel me with sadness now, with a sense of loss. Like Picard, I've lost loves ones, more and more each day. I myself used to be so optimistic. But, like Picard, I'm finding less and less to be optimistic about. I think Stewart's acting really captures this. So, I do like this aspect of the story.Cameos: I absolutely love this aspect of the show. Every episode I've downloaded so far (pirated of course), I just can't wait to see if another old favorite will appear.Non-episodic format: I do agree with the others here. I dislike it when any show has a non-episodic format. And, unfortunately, this is like that. I think what I dislike about it, with Star Trek, is that with old Star Treks I can watch episodes over and over again. I still watch Voyager and TNG episodes every day. (I have those series downloaded.)But, with a continuous story format, it may be good on the first viewing. You can't wait to progress the story each episode. And it's like that here too. I am anticipating each new episode, caus I want to see what will happen in the story. But as far as rewatching later, (I like to rewatch shows on a random shuffle in my media player) that wont work with this. Once you know the story there's no point to see it again.Violence: Here I totally disagree with the other reviews. Well maybe not disagree. I do see their point. Star Trek in the past tried to avoid violence, and acts of violence by beloved characters. However, in those past series, that annoyed the f##k out of me. I felt it was brain washing, to try to make us sheep like slaves. Or even worse, they did do alot of violence on almost every episode of past Star Trek series, but then hypocritically denounced violence. In other words, they did just as much violence, if not more, than ST:P, they just didn't show it's effects (i.e. bodys were vaporized instead of stabbed).Here, I think the violence is the best part, to me at least. When I told my brother about this series he asked, \"Is it any good?\" I replied, \"It's ok. It has alot of pretty extreme violence.\" He replied, \"Well that sounds good.\" So anyways, I really like the violence. It's the only thing that breaks up some of the boredom that the show can tend to have.Boredom: I have to agree with some of the others here. Like many shows that try to be serious, it can be boring. This whole series so far, really could have been done in a few episodes.I don't really blame the show though. People are just boring now days. They don't even know what excitement is. How could they make a show about something they can't even imagine. Maybe only us oldbies, from a time before internet, when we had to go out and do crazy things for fun, can remember excitement.Anyhow, I just finished episode 6 and the excitement level has definitely picked up. ( I rate ep. 5 and ep. 6, both very good, and exciting.Future setting: Finally, a new series or film that isn't a f##king prequel or remake. I could rant about prequels or remakes all day. (lol) And I won't feel satisfied until every person who ever made a prequel is dead. They ruined Star Trek with Enterprise. They ruined Star Trek with Discovery. They ruined Star Trek with those films (who's names I never even bothered to learn). The whole point of sci fi is the future. Not a point in time, between now and the future.So, I am so very glad that this isn't another prequel.Characters: I'm liking all the characters so far. I particularly like the guy with the sword. I like his ultra-violence. But, he is also funny. He is one of the few funny things in this show. Which is saying something, since he doesn't even talk much. Just the look on his face, and the few things he does say, always make me smile. The other characters seem good too. I don't know any of their names yet (on ep. 6), or I'd mention more characters I'm liking.Final thoughts: It may not be the best Star Trek (not even close). But it's still worth watching. I've been enjoying it, and eagerly anticipating new episodes, each week (Unlike Discovery, which I completely quit watching). I.m on episode 6 now. It could change. But as of now I'm giving it an 8. Before you say, \"That's too high.\" In my rating system, an 8 means, fairly enjoyable for a one time viewing.","rating":"4\/10","date":"29 February 2020"}
{"title":"7 stars post season 1, 3 stars after 2 - what a royal mess","review":"I'll leave my original review after season 1 at the end of my update (after I watched season 2).After season 2, which I watched in full: potential totally wasted. They made the show's possible strengths consistently into weaknesses, and tedious melodramas. Plot holes and neglected subplots aplenty. Total disrespect for Trek lore and feel is now the rule.I really wanted to give this show the benefit of the doubt after season 1. But I'm sorry I did.The showrunners need to steer this franchise train wreck back into sanity. I then assert: put this show to Ira Steven Behr and Ronald D. Moore if they're at all willing, immediately. They might be able to at least salvage something from the trash heap. Kurtzman is increasingly steering this franchise into disaster.I give it three stars now after season 2, because of good production values, and special effects. Most of the rest is subpar.I can only hope season 3 salvages something, but all bets are off at this point, frankly.Post season 1 review:Recommencing Star Trek, in the age of Netflix and Marvel dominance, and more modern audiences, was always going to be challenging. I don't agree with people whining this isn't exactly like TNG, Voyager, and DS9 of their memories. TV has changed since then, and it's ok to try new things, rather than just milk nostalgia.Centering it around though perhaps TNG's greatest asset - Picard - was a smart move. Patrick Stewart is great throughout, and brings gravity and dignity (and smiles, in a few great comedy moments).Pluses aside from this:I liked some of the new characters in this new crew, and discovering the scars on their history - it's important they haven't obsessed about pulling in just old characters, but building new ones.An episode with Riker and Troi was wonderfully done, and seeing again Jeri Ryan as Seven has been a highlight - you'll probably enjoy her character development. The 'return' of Data, curious though the plot around him is, has also given some tender and thoughtful moments at the beginning and end. These moments mark out the series, for anyone who's followed this wonderful android's tale in the Star Trek universe.The plot didn't go where I would have liked - exploring the extent of the aftermath in the Federation's rebuild after the Dominion War, and Voyager's return from the Delta Quadrant - but choosing Romulan relations after the desruction of their empire, was fair enough as a way to go.The cons - the writing has been very up and down at times.The villains in the end though aren't nearly as great, consistent or memorable as in some Star Trek in the end, after a promising beginning. Romulans are a practical and secretive people of course, but not stupid - and their holding to a relic and fantasy of 'all artificial life will doom us!' just felt like it insulted their intelligence, frankly.A continuing romance happening between two of the leads, after one had just lost her partner in an absolutely horrific way?! - this felt silly and tactless to me.An elf type character, based clearly on Legolas from Lord of the Rings, was irritating at times, and obvious.One memorable TNG character being revisited only to be killed off later, with only slight exploration as to his development in the meantime, was annoying.Some good character driven writing at the start, and midway, went sadly thrown the way of the dodo too towards the last few episodes - some buildups had little payoff.The climax wasn't as bad at least as some TV - looking at you here, Game of Thrones! However it still reeked of Star Wars and Marvel type influences - having to have a 'huge mega battle' and character turncoats a plenty. Macguffin reliance, and 'it all ended happily ever after' itis slotted in at the end too? Uneccessary, and silly.Rushed and staggered plotting too at the climax threw off the coda - sad when at times it had built up certain things nicely.Summary: glimpses of genius at times, but needs to build itself, and think about it's writing and character development more across a series.Hopefully season 2 will improve, and this does have a lot of potential. In my world, think about bringing the likes of Ira Steven Behr and Ronald D. Moore back on board please, if you're into serialised storytelling. Nobody has marshalled Star Trek better than these two for serial stories, and I'd love to see what they could do with this series.In the right hands this could be a blinder of a Star Trek show - even the best of them all - but it needs to learn off the first season's many mistakes, and adjust accordingly.","rating":"3\/10","date":"28 March 2020"}

{"title":"Not Star Trek, but not bad","review":"Certainly not a Star Trek feel, but a decent story. If you want a tinge of nostalgia, but are ok with less Star Trek, less Sci-Fi and more of a thriller, slow burn Davinci code feel (or even T2 in the Raffi scenes), then you won't be disappointed. I was never a huge Star Trek fan, but I have fond memories of TNG with my dad in the 90s. This certainly isn't TNG 2.0, but if you're not a diehard and are just looking for a decent thriller with a touch of nostalgia this certainly won't rub you the wrong way too much, and may even be enjoyable. Is this in any of my top #X lists? Certainly not, but is it worth a weekend binge so long as You're not a Star Trek canon hound? 100% yes.Lower score for TNG faithful, higher score for face value story content. (I'd say this is better than the Q series finale acting-wise for sure).","rating":"5\/10","date":"28 September 2021"}
{"title":"Series 1 Great Series 2 just boring.","review":"Loved Next Generation and Sir Patrick but being honest here. Series 1 (8\/10) was excellent and so promising but series 2 (2\/10) is just so boring and the 7th episode is truly awful! It's a space programme not running about on earth in modern times! Really ruined this and if series 3 like 2 then truly not worth watching.","rating":"5\/10","date":"2 May 2022"}
{"title":"A lesson in bad writing","review":"Not sure how this could have been green lot. The writing is some of the worse I've seen. Painful to watch.","rating":"5\/10","date":"27 December 2020"}
