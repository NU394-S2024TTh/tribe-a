{"title":"Entertaining Enough","review":"I know Avatar: The Last Airbender is one of the most popular and loved animated shows of all time. They even tried to make a movie about it back in 2010 the is universally panned. The animated series has a 9.4 rating here and the movie only a 4.0 so people have been hungry for a good live adaptation of the animated series for a long time. It's finally here. It's almost impossible to please everyone who liked the original animated series because everyone has their own expectations on how it should be and they hate when it differs even a little from the original. They don't seem to understand how they don't have the luxury of having unlimited episodes and get go as in depth as the original, it has to be adapted into only 8 episodes per season. I had no problem at all, I liked this series so much that I binged all 8 episodes in only 2 days. I just couldn't stop watching and already looking forward to next season.","rating":"8\/10","date":"1 April 2024"}
{"title":"Lost Arc of Aang","review":"I understand that adapting a cartoon series scene by scene into a live adaptation is impractical. However, removing the lead character's pivotal arc, which was integral to the essence of the original story, weakens the storytelling. The Aang portrayed lacks the innocence and depth of the 12-year-old protagonist we grew to love; instead, he's presented as a young adult novel archetype warrior.Moreover, the characters seem to lack the comedic traits that defined them, resulting in scenes that feel devoid of emotion and overly somber.The direction feels stagnant, with characters rigidly placed and delivering exposition rather than engaging dynamically with the world around them.Numerous unnecessary changes detract from the impactful moments, surprising reveals, and character development that made the original series so compelling.While I appreciate the efforts put into the visuals and action sequences, they shouldn't be the sole focus of a production with such a substantial budget.","rating":"6\/10","date":"22 February 2024"}
{"title":"No, it's not that good and don't even compare it to the Netflix One Piece","review":"I'm too exhausted with these pointless live action remakes of animated classics to get angry anymore. This Netflix redo of AVATAR: THE LAST AIRBENDER is at best competent, with handsome production design and costuming. Storywise, it strips out the humor of the original, leaving us with grim imitations of the characters we so loved. The sadsack reimagining of the feisty Katara is particularly horrid.The acting is spotty. Some of the performers are pretty good, but so many of the line readings come off like community theater. Where's the passion?While not the fiasco the previous live action feature was, this new AVATAR is just pointless. Yeah it's not bad, but why settle for not bad when the original show was great? I'd rather just rewatch the old one for the hundredth time.","rating":"6\/10","date":"27 February 2024"}
{"title":"I turned it off and watched the original cartoon instead.","review":"At long last, Netflix's Avatar: The Last Airbender has arrived. And I must say, I didn't necessarily care for it too much. This calls for the classic line: If it ain't broke, don't try to fix it.I wasn't swayed one way or the other. I didn't hate it, but I didn't love it. It kind of just exists. I couldn't help but compare everything in the show to the original cartoon. (One of the best TV shows ever in my book.) Everything was done in its shadow.At one point I was watching with my brothers and we were like \"this is kind of mid. We should just watch the cartoon.\" And that's what we did. I think that tells you all you need to know.I heard someone say that this was on par with Disney's recent live action remakes. Mostly soulless remakes. And I would have to agree.The best part of this show is the casting I would say. The acting is just ok though.Overall, I didn't care too much for it.","rating":"6\/10","date":"27 February 2024"}
{"title":"Never saw the animated series so I had no expectations","review":"Avatar: The Last Airbender is based off the animated series of the same name. It takes place in a world that is divided into 4 different nations, each nation is made up of an element (Fire, Water, Air and Earth). The Avatar is the only one who can master all 4 elements and the one who brings balance between all the nations until one day the Fire Nation decides to invade. The Avatar is the only one who can stop them but he suddenly disappears. A hundred years later a new Avatar named, Aang, emerges. With some help from friends he must master the elements to bring peace and balance back to the world. I have to admit that I've never seen the animated series or movie so I went into this with no expectations or prior knowledge of the series. I've read good things and the trailer looked good so I gave it a shot. I'm glad I did because I really enjoyed it. I thought it was going to be more aimed to younger audiences but it's enjoyable for everyone.","rating":"8\/10","date":"1 April 2024"}
{"title":"I enjoyed it","review":"I saw many episodes of the first season of the cartoon, but not all. Back when there were no streaming services so I needed to watch it on television when I passed by chaning the channels. Through the years I got parts of the first story but never the last episode of season 1. So I am aware of the story.I also saw the movie or movies, I am not sure how many there are. Het last one was not bad, it looks like this series. So I see the battle in the north again. But I must say, it was no problem. This series is very watchable. Sometimes you have amazing shots. But overall you can see the background faded and the foreground sharp and too much light, so you see it is fake. I think the really big amazing shots cost a lot of money and even that the other scens looking fake, it is still of a high quality. I think it is also combined with real shots.I mostly like the characters, but many times I think: there is something off. Like the parents or the crazy king. Also the acting can be a bit off, like it is too static. Just like the fake backgrounds. It looks to clinical.But overall I believe the characters. The most important characters are believable for me. It also sometimes has the same sillynes as the original. The pace is also good, but I think sometimes it is going too fast. I think they take some shortcuts, but overall you get the main story. I enjoyed watching this. I am starting watching the original again, but then from season 2.So I think there should be a season 2. I do not know if I like it after I just saw the original. But I saw many horrible adapation of books, games and animation. This is a very good take. It can be a bit better, bit more clever maybe. But this is solid.","rating":"7\/10","date":"6 April 2024"}
{"title":"Amazing CGI and Effects, Bad acting and Script","review":"I really loved the animated Series of Avatar, watched it so many times.Good things :\nAlthough this season is much better than last flop movie but they missed so many things. CGI is much better, effects and fights are really good. Bending effects couldnt be better .Bad things :\nThe fun of characters was nowhere to be seen. Sokka was suppose to be a funny guy but they made him look so angry all the time. Same goes for bhoomi and Iroh.Story has been changed much enough that for person who never watched it wouldnt understand all of it.Dialogues and script is so cringe at some places. Specially dialogues of kitara and sokka. Unnecessarily trying to fit the dialogues of animated series without setting up the whole script .So its 6\/10 for me.","rating":"6\/10","date":"23 February 2024"}
{"title":"This Series Is All Bark And No Bite","review":"The live-action Avatar: The Last Airbender is all bark and no bite. Now what could I possibly mean by that? Well keep reading and I will break it down. Avatar: The Last Airbender was one of my most anticipated series set to drop in 2024. So in turn I had big expectations coming into this show. I knew it was going to be fire before I even saw the trailer and all we had were the first set of still images. Once I saw the trailer I was blown away. In comparison to the original cartoon, it passes the eye test. But that still doesn't explain why this series has no bite.Well, to do that we have to understand what the bark is first. If you haven't guessed by now the bark is how good this show looks on screen. This series is striking. From the colors to the CGI and visual effects to the way they use light in different scenarios. If I'm being honest though the visuals were never really in question. Just because of the amount of technology available nowadays. So I was super confident that they would get it right this time. That's right I said \"this time\" because their first attempt at a live-action Avatar back in 2010 was a disaster.This leads me to explain what the actual bite is. The \"bite\" is the thing everyone loves most about any series or movie and that's the story. Yeah, seeing all the different bending styles is cool. But what makes the series legendary is the story. Avatar: The Last Airbender is one of the most visually appealing series to drop this year hands down. Even though some of the storylines don't hit like they did in the original series it's still very good. Nostalgia aside the biggest element separating good and bad live-action adaptations is story.Now, I have found a new appreciation for live-action adaptations. In part due to what Netflix is doing with legacy series like Avatar or One Piece. For one expectations are so high nowadays because of what Marvel has been able to do with the mcu in the past. But it's different jumping from 2D animation to live-action because the gap is so wide. You go from a limitless canvas where your only limitation is your imagination. To then create those same moments in the \"real world,\" with \"real people\". You know where a thing called gravity exists. Fortunately, technology for the most part isn't the biggest limiting factor anymore.The biggest limiter in live-action series now is time. Most of these live-action adaptations are condensed to around 8 -10 episodes. They have to be super precise in the episodes they choose to cover because if not. You run the risk of creating major plot holes in the story. Combining complementary arcs in one episode is very difficult in itself. Unfortunately, this formula has its ups and downs so the pacing suffers a tad bit in the process. Nothing major but it's something to improve on for future seasons.Now by no means does this mean I think this series is trash. I enjoyed watching every episode and something I plan on watching it again. Now I see potential in Team Avatar even though they haven't hit their groove yet. It speaks to underlying chemistry issues that can be fixed eventually. It was just not the bite I was looking for which is why I gave it an 8\/10 G-Files Score. I can tell you this though I'm super excited for the next season. One thing they did do a good job of was establishing all the players and motivations. Granted some portrayals were better than others. But with more time they can all take their roles to the next level.The only thing I wish for is to include more of the journey. Even a short montage would suffice. I want it to feel like time is passing and not fast travel everywhere. Appa didn't get any love this season and he is just as big a part of Team Avatar as anybody even Aang. Plus nobody on the squad has a bigger bite than Appa himself so show him a little more respect.","rating":"8\/10","date":"3 April 2024"}
{"title":"Where is the humour?","review":"As a longtime fan of \"Avatar: The Last Airbender,\" I approached Netflix's adaptation with cautious optimism. Unfortunately, what I found was a series that fell short of capturing the magic and depth of the original.One of the most glaring issues was the lackluster dialogue. Lines that were iconic in the original series were either altered beyond recognition or delivered with a lack of emotion. For example, the pivotal moment when Aang emerges from the iceberg and speaks to Katara lacked the sincerity and charm that made the scene memorable. Instead of the heartfelt exchange between two characters meeting for the first time, it felt forced and flat.Aang: \"I need to ask you something. Please, come closer.\"\nKatara: \"What is it?\"\nAang: \"Will you go penguin sledding with me?\"Moreover, the adaptation failed to capture the essence of the characters. Aang, Katara, and Sokka lacked the depth and development that made them so beloved in the original series. Instead of complex and nuanced personalities, they felt one-dimensional and uninspired.Overall, Netflix's adaptation of \"Avatar: The Last Airbender\" missed the mark. While the visual effects were impressive and the production value was high, it ultimately failed to capture the heart and soul of the original series. Fans of the original will likely be disappointed by this lackluster adaptation.Rating: 6\/10.","rating":"6\/10","date":"22 February 2024"}
{"title":"Weak dialogue and rushed pacing compromise an otherwise well-done adaptation","review":"The Netflix adaptation of Avatar is decent. It takes the core plot points, remixes them a little, and turns it into a slightly more mature-toned version. It's still family friendly, but more closely resembling a modern PG-13 superhero story than the PG original.My core complaints are the dialogue writing and the overall rush to get through the plot at the expense of deeper character development. There is a lot of fanservice, references to the Kyoshi books, a lot of action, and some small changes that I would argue are a little better than the original. However, those are at the expense of a deeper connection with the characters. The most well-developed characters are Aang and Zuko, but even they get a few of their core characteristics shaved off. Aang is a lot less goofy. He still acts like a kid and makes a few good jokes, but he isn't going on little sidequest adventures anymore. There's no elephant koi at Kyoshi Island and only a little cart surfing in Omashu. It's like they trimmed the fat and lost the flavour.Another issue is the dialogue. Especially in the first episode, the dialogue is very clumsy and exposition-heavy. A lot of telling, and not enough showing. It does improve a bit from episodes 2-8, but a rough start gives a very poor impression, unfortunately.In terms of the good, there is a decent amount. The choice to combine several plot elements from different episodes into one does work. For example, the third and fourth episodes in Omashu combine plot elements from \"The King of Omashu\", \"Jet\", \"The Northern Air Temple\" and surprisingly \"The Cave of Two Lovers\". You'd think I'm crazy, but it surprisingly works a lot better than it should.Then there's the fight scenes. While not as impactful as the animated show, the mix of top-tier CG effects with real choreography far surpasses most fantasy television, let alone the awful 2010 movie. There's no six earthbenders lifting a single pebble in this one, I can assure you of that. Waterbending feels a little weak in this show, but that's about it honestly.Overall, I'm impressed by the effort. It's not a perfect show, and it definitely isn't remotely better than the original, but I do think it's worth a watch, and I'm looking forward to seeing the rest when it comes out.","rating":"6\/10","date":"24 February 2024"}
{"title":"I can see why the original writers left","review":"How does Aang make it through the entire season and never even attempted to learn how to wate-rbend??....I thought the series started off really well. The costumes were designed quite poorly, they looked cosplay-ish and even then they're deep in battle they never even seem to get dirty. The animals were designed extremely well and made the series a bit more bearable. The acting wasn't terrible but the over-acting worsened as the series went on and by the end seemed soap opera-ish. In the first few episodes they made minor changes to the storyline, which is expected but half way through they take it entirely too far and started forcing different stories together and started making abilities that are supposed to be unique and special available to every character. They also made Aang seem lazy. He didn't even try to learn waterbending because he thinks one of the past avatars would take over and do it for him. 1\/3 of the series is over and Aang is just as untrained as he was 100 years ago. I hope they do better next time around.","rating":"5\/10","date":"2 March 2024"}
{"title":"Way better than the last movie, however some criticisms..","review":"First (1), the best arc that set the bar high in acting, casting, look and feel, storytelling, direction for Avatar is the Kyoshi Island arc (episode 2). They definitely got that right, 9.5\/10. BRAVO! Whoever was involved there, give them a raise!! The worst and most disappointing arc was the Omashu arc (episode 3). They tried to do too much in one episode, it seemed rushed, as a result, it was just a mess, 4\/10. I almost gave up watching the rest of the show because of episode 3. It was like the director, scriptwriters, editors took the day off. Should have just concentrated on a favorite arc and run upwards with it (my preferred would have been a way better King Bumi arc, drop the Jet, Teo and badger mole arcs). Or give them entire episodes each. I repeat, episode 3 was a mess, very disappointing. Second (2), everywhere else (that is not the Kyoshi island arc), the acting still needs a lot of improvement (which means the director needs to step up as well and bring it out of the actors). I rate the acting as follows: Aang (6), Katara (6) lacks emotion, Sokka (6) needs to be funnier\/goofyer, Azula, Sozin, Ozai (5), Iroh (6). I think these actors did a way better job in portraying their characters: June (8), Zhao (8.5), Zuko (8.5), Avatar Kyoshi (9), Suki (9), Yukari (9). Third (3), the characters as they were presented have too many flaws. Azula is too weak rather than scary\/powerful or frightening\/intimidating. Maybe she could have played the part Toph better, but needs to act tougher. The old movie had a better Azula. The actress who played June (bounty hunter) would have made a way better Azula. Sozin was too friendly looking, doesn't look like anyone who wants to conqueror anything. Ozai though they got the look right didn't appear scary and overpowering\/intimidating\/bent on conquest. Mai and Tylee - almost invisible. Would have preferred more airtime and character development of them rather than Jet and Teo arc mess of episode 3. Fourth (4), the Northern Water Tribe arc, I thought it was just OK, the storytelling of animated version was just way better. The actors for Yue and Pakku, I think they did a good job, 7 each. Overall, I give the live action season a 7\/10. Will watch season 2.","rating":"7\/10","date":"21 March 2024"}
{"title":"Very good work, but it is darkened by the legacy and weight of the series name","review":"I can see that a lot of people attacking this series of Avatar The Last Airbender. There are even people who criticized the series even before its release due to the disastrous series that was released in 2010. On my part as a fan of the Avatar The Legend of Aang series, I can say that I very much enjoyed this show, starting with the story that They kept it with a few minor changes, in addition to the wonderful acting of the characters. I loved the character of Aang and how he balanced being a child who wanted to play but carrying responsibility for the world at the same time. I also liked the character of Zuko, his story, his motivations, and his constant struggle to find the Avatar to restore his inheritance to rule. I also liked the change that occurred at Saka's character from what it was in the original series, from a funny character to a domineering character with a painful past and a feeling of letting his father down. The series gave each character its due and gave them enough depth that made us relate to them, in addition to the smooth progression in the story without there being an exaggerated prolongation of events with development with very distinctive and noticeable for the characters, and I also respected the preservation of the atmosphere of mystery and wisdom characteristic of the original series with perfect photography and very excellent CGI. Perhaps there are a few things that I did not like, such as Aang's weak acting in sad moments and the previous Avatars not giving any development to Aang's character. In fact, I think this series is one of the most underrated series in this year because it carries the name and legacy of a great series that created most of young people's childhoods and an audience that looks forward to an iconic work like it, and I expect the second part to be better than the first.","rating":"8\/10","date":"11 April 2024"}
{"title":"Excellent VFx but story and writing is lacking.","review":"Overall i enjoyed the show. The visual FX is a spectacle to watch and is rather nicely executed. The backdrops and sets were all very well done. The characters themselves give tribute the original story and characters but that is there my problems with the show begins.My biggest disappointment is that If you've watched the movie you could basically can skip this. The general story begins and ends the same.The writing at times felt forced, bland and \"kinda pausing for reaction\" bad. The actors themselves i liked, but nothing memorable either.The princess character and here entourage annoyed me to no end and the whole writing around her felt extremely forced. And while writing this part or this review I even lower my score from 7 to 6\/10 so bad it was for me.","rating":"6\/10","date":"23 February 2024"}
{"title":"Good, Could Be Great With Tweaks","review":"The original Avatar the last Airbender series is one of my favorites of all time. I remember watching it live week to week as a high schooler and thinking how weird it was I was so into a \"kids show\" on Nickelodeon. As I get older I've watched it a few more times and the more I watch it, the more I love it. It holds up in every aspect-the visuals, writing, character arcs and relationships amongst each other, humor, etc.So when this show was announced I was skeptical because the movie stunk, and because the original series makes it a lot to live up to. I've now watched the whole first season and I have to say it exceeded my low expectations. As others have said, the visuals are incredible and some of the casting is actually very much on point. I thought Yue, Iroh, Zhao and Zuko in particular were all pretty great (However, other casting decisions were not good at all, but that wasn't my main problem that I'll get to later). I appreciated that they didn't veer too far off the path of the first one in terms of plot (although they did rearrange some things that I thought were unnecessary and skipped some story sections I liked). Keep sticking to the source material in the future seasons!The thing I think they missed on big time though, and hope to see changed in the coming seasons, is the brightness, levity, and humor of the original series. The first one walked the line really well of portraying at times very mature themes, but packaged them in a way that was very digestible and often times funny. The remake ditched that strategy almost completely, and the tone is over the top serious and at times even dark. I really couldn't specifically believe how they portrayed Aang and Sokka as mostly serious characters, it felt wrong. They're both kids, they don't need to force them to act like adults, it's weird. To add to that, Katara is portrayed timid this time, when in the original she was feisty and the voice of reason to two goofballs.If you watch the original for just one episode after watching the live action version you see how radical the tone shift is, and I hope they don't keep going in this direction, it could be so much better with a brighter and funnier tone, one that doesn't take itself so seriously but still can tackle mature themes. That was one of the pieces that made the first one amazing.","rating":"6\/10","date":"14 April 2024"}
{"title":"Surprisingly good","review":"I wasn't intending to watch this, but after a while, there wasn't anything else except the trashy Love is Blind nonsense and I decided to give this a go. The first few minutes were really B grade but it got much better and I ended up watching all episodes over two days. I loved the little kid who played Aang, and the two who played Katara and Sokka. Prince Zuko was also good. It was great to see so many Native Americans in the story. I will eagerly await season 2, which didn't expect when I started watching it. If you want a straight forward fantasy filled story with great special effects, with no mind bending underlying themes, this one can be recommended.","rating":"8\/10","date":"29 March 2024"}
{"title":"Pretty Darn Good","review":"Never having seen the animated version, I had no expectations going into this. I didn't even know what the storyline was until I read it on Netflix. On viewing the first episode, I was totally hooked and binge watched the rest of the series. Here are my thoughts.The good:\nGreat visuals, great CGI, compelling story, and characters you can actually like (unlike so many shows these days). Add to that some very good action sequences and fast paced storytelling, and you pretty much have a recipe for success.The bad:\nAs with so many other shows, the writers do not seem to know how to write a great season finale... it wasn't terrible, but it was unsatisfying. Additionally, the acting and dialog suffered at times, particularly with the Aang and the firebender princess (can't remember her name).Conclusion:\nI thought this was a very good effort and well worth watching. I'm looking forward to season two.","rating":"7\/10","date":"25 March 2024"}

The actor has done an amazing job, the way he portrays the avatar as well as his charisma and character fits it perfectly and is very amusing to watchThe story is not something they could play with much but the story is pretty basic, I am here more for the visuals and the actions of the series.Would definitely recommend.","rating":"8\/10","date":"6 April 2024"}

Also the didn't spare in the usage of bending which is great.But i was thrown a bit off by the threatical like acting, and the script. Maybe I need to get used to it. But it feels a bit forced how they act, like is very improbable to behave like that in reality. I guess they try to have similar reactions as the original characters in the show, but since they are cartoons its more acceptable. For a live action adaptation i would expect a bit more real\/normal behaviour. But then again, i only watched one episode so far, so I'll try to get use to it.","rating":"6\/10","date":"22 February 2024"}
{"title":"Gorgeous effects, failure of characters","review":"First things first, they did a top notch job with visual effects. Bending techniques, the way the elements connect with the bodies of the characters, the places all look wonderful. They bring the world alive. However, that is not what ATLA is about. In order for the characters to have their development we need to see their interaction, we need to see their characters, that is why we love the characters in the cartoon. Here the characters are all over the place. There is no goofiness, they are all too serious which bothers.Also, showing things subtly, inserting the message between the lines is the strength of the cartoon. Here they deliver ling winded, empty, and bland speeches that do not move us.","rating":"3\/10","date":"22 February 2024"}
{"title":"Better than expected but parts of the wood they build is inconsistent","review":"I love the special effects, this series is visually stunning. Castings was mostly spot on especially Aang, Iroh and Zhao. The actors were perfect for these role. Actors that were miscast are Princess Yue who looks out of place and they put a bad wig on her, Sokka was also a miss for me.I just wish they could be more consistent in the world they build. Aang can \"fly\" by bending the air yet when he needed to escape he was physically climbing a wall. He also have the strongest power but waa kidnapped and restrain with just a rope. Why? This is so inconsistent with how he is supposed to be.Katara should have had the opportunity to work on improving water bending and hand to hand combat. They make her seem like a prodigy who just happens to figure it out. She had a cool fight scene with Zuko but we never seen her train with a kungfu master.The back story for Prince. Zuko was done really well, I really feel for the character. Iroh being hit on by a girl young enough to be his daughter is bizzare especially when it added nothing to the plot.The finale also had this build up and they just had \"godzilla\" fight the battle for them, it's so anticlimactic. Despite these flaws I still really e not the series, it's a goos fun adventure to watch during movie nights!","rating":"","date":"2 April 2024"}

I'm only up to episode 3 and we already met the Mechanist and his son in Omashu and not the Northern Air Temple and we even already met Jet as well in the same place. I understand why we met Azula but that's even kind of weird. And we haven't even met Bumi yet and we've seen all these characters. So that's all I've got so far up to episode 3. Oh and Sokka didn't get to dress up as a Kyoshi warrior \u00f0\u0178\u02dc\u00ad\u00f0\u0178\u02dc\u00ad\u00f0\u0178\u02dc\u00ad","rating":"6\/10","date":"26 February 2024"}
{"title":"This is not Aang's story. This is Zuko's.","review":"I am very loyal to the original animated series, and I understand why the creators of the original series decided to part ways on this adaptation. I was so angry when I started this, so many plot points and characters were mushed together to fit into less episodes that it left out huge development details, huge connections that become critical later in the storyline, and above all else, Aang's story felt nothing like him. But then I switched perspectives, and made Zuko the main character in my head... and the whole thing changed. I was no longer mad about what was wrong with Aang's story because it was not the necessary to the main characters plot. I was still very annoyed... but I wasn't fuming and yelling at the TV (which I did, more than once). Is the original better? Hands down! But anyone who has seen the original should have already been prepared, knowing nothing will be better than what we all already loved. But because of how well the original handled character development, we all love Zuko just as much as we love Aang. So try watching it as if this is his story, it may make it easier for you to enjoy. Do I think this series can and should do better in the future at staying truer to the original plot? Absolutely. I am hoping they had to combine plot points in this season to get the show off the ground and get a bigger budget from Netflix on season two, and with a larger budget will stay truer to the story. I think it is worth watching, if only to see certain aspects come to life in live action. Just know there are parts you will be mad about. And give it a chance with Zuko in mind as the star.","rating":"7\/10","date":"24 February 2024"}

I recall the first time I saw the avatar when I was 12 years old approximately, it was something magical and mystical, I wanted to become a bender of any element like Zuko, Aang, Katara or Toph and I didn't saw the series ever again until the this series dropped out, I watched the 3 seasons and wanted to defend the live action series because it has its own magic. I love the character of uncle iroh but in the first season it looked kind of angry later in the second and third he was more opened and lovely, in the live action serie it gave him his lovely personality since the begging so I appreciate that.

This is better than the movie, but it doesn't make it that good but it's not that bad either.It's like every one is saying the visuals are great and the bending looks good, even though it's wonky sometimes.Pretty cool to watch all the past Avatars, and their point of view, even though it seems like its all Aang did throughout the show.I get that it's a lot to pack in 8 episodes, but story line for Jet and the Mechanist felt weird and confused, i would rewrite episodes 3 and 4 everything is tangled and kind of bad. Also... The tunnel of two lovers without aang... Cmooon if you're going to do it now... Do it with Aang!The actors for Aang and Katara seemed pretty bland to me. They only had like 2\/3 emotions but Sokka really stole the show for me. One thing to high note is the Good chemistry between iroh and Zuko. And the fire lord is pretty cool as well!One thing that really lacked was the whole waterbending training arc which was basically non existing. For the water book having Aang not waterbending at all is pretty stupid. And Katara being called a master with no training whatsoever it seemed a very Mary Sue moment.It's early but I think the casting for Azula, ty Lee and Mai doesn't look that good, I hope they prove me wrong.","rating":"7\/10","date":"23 February 2024"}
{"title":"Perfectly Imperfect","review":"This is more a refreshing adaptation of a source material that's been delivered in recent times. Yes. Some of the acting is clunky and a bit goofy; however, watching the character dynamics with each other is, quite honestly, as close to the source that could be expected. Firebenders manifest fire. Waterbenders look like waterbenders. This can be watched, and you can still reminisce the animated adventure without feeling an injustice has been committed like a past adaptation that won't be mentioned here.......ever again........personally, I don't hover over films, shows, or media in general looking for inconsistencies. But as a causal viewer. This is perfectly imperfect. It captures the world of Avatar. I'm relieved of the dread of expecting some artist's COMPLETE reimagining of a beloved source and elated to find something that is a retelling of it in a different medium. True to the source; true to the story. I appreciate this beyond words, and am excited to see it through.","rating":"8\/10","date":"24 February 2024"}
{"title":"Not bad","review":"As a big fan of the animated avatar, I can say that it's not bad. It's certainly better than the 2010 film but it's also not as good as last year's One Piece.The CGI most of the time looks very good. Although there are a few scenes where it looks tragic. For example, Aang when he first enters avatar state looks like a plasticine human.The animals and ghosts look beautiful. The fight scenes and the elements look cool too.As for the actors, sometimes they play very stiff and totally emotionless and sometimes quite well. However, most of the time the actors really try, some come out better, some worse. The choice of actors for the roles is very good, almost all of them fit their roles, there are exceptions such as Princess Yue, Mai and King Bumi who to me do not fit the look of the characters.Plot changes obviously had to happen and it's understandable because how would they pack over 20 episodes into 8? Some of the changes look cool and don't really bother me. However, most of the changes surprise me a lot. The solution from the original would have looked much better and would have made more sense. Because of these changes, many of the characters are just different and do not reflect their character from the animation.Why do they tell us everything? What? What for? Why? How? Instead of showing the character's emotions, what motivates them, what their intentions are, what they are afraid of, they tell it all to the camera. I don't understand why they treat the viewer like an idiot who can't think for himself.Let's hope the next season is better than this one.","rating":"7\/10","date":"24 February 2024"}
{"title":"Unironically Really Good","review":"I was rolling my eyes at the first few minutes of dialogue after an \"exciting\" introductory scene that fell very flat. Immediately I was thinking \"uh oh, they have really failed to have the bending and battle effects read on screen.\" And then the dialogue goes on to give super unnecessary exposition.But after the first 15 minutes or so, there was a lot to like. And it just grew each episode.I had to let go of some of the things we all deeply love about the original, but most of that was due to the live action medium versus animated. The way animation can stylize facial expressions and reactions, it really becomes a part of the characters. I'm thinking clearly of some of Sokka's confused\/frustrated faces from the original, just inherently hilarious.Anyway, I enjoyed it much more than I expected to. And I find myself very excited for the second and third seasons.Maybe even 8.5\/10, but it does lose some points for the \"tell not show\" dialogue others have mentioned.","rating":"8\/10","date":"23 March 2024"}
{"title":"Quite alright","review":"The film attempts to bring the old feel of the animated version of Avatar: The Legend of Aang. Where the film explores a very interesting editing style. The downside that I feel is that some characters don't reflect their true power. But I quite enjoyed the performance of each role played. I myself have watched avatars from the animated series, Korra to some of them reading comics and some short animations. I realised that avatar is not a children's film but the essence of life.It's a film that you need to watch but I would recommend watching the animated film because it's better and more engaging.","rating":"7\/10","date":"18 March 2024"}
{"title":"Show it, don't tell it","review":"The visuals are stunning - the effects are more impressive than I hoped. Unfortunately the dialogue leaves very little to the imagination. It is so literal! Good storytelling doesn't involve explaining to the audience the beginning middle and end in the first 20 minutes. Did Chat-GPT write this?! This reeks of studio execs having to get this out and not hiring\/ supporting good writers. It cheapens the acting, and you lose the emotion, passion, and energy. The animated show wasn't about the sick fight scenes, but that's likely all you're gonna get from the live action.Kid who plays Zuko absolutely nails it. He couldn't have been cast better.","rating":"5\/10","date":"22 February 2024"}
{"title":"It Is Not Bad","review":"Let's get the bias out of the way. I grew up with this yes, but I was never obsessed with it like many people are.I am very pleased with how this project was approached. The CGI and such looks extremely good considering how much of the show MUST RELY ENTIRELY on it. There are of course some things that look weird but, just like the One Piece live action, you're willing to ignore it because of course it's going to look like that. The acting is decent. Most characters are good if not excellent. Aang is really rough though. They take the \"he's a 12 year old\" thing in a weird direction and make him an insufferably stupid child who also happens to be a wise monk. The result is a character who acts like a silly kid but still has to take the time to use his enlightening wisdom to insult people he shouldn't be insulting. Its awkward and clunky.The writing is...stilted. They did a very respectable job cutting out the useless Nickelodeon filler nonsense from the original animation. It makes for a far more approachable show. That being said, the last few episodes suffer greatly because of this. Without getting too spoiler happy, there are numerous small and seemingly stupid filler events that are written out or glazed over that mattered heavily for the final outcome of this arc in the animation. They made no effort at all to fix the holes they created here.It doesn't damage the show, but if you're familiar with the animation you will notice the strangeness of it. There are also numerous small character quirks added and detracted throughout the show that make for some odd scenes but thats forgettable at best. Overall this is as good as you could want for an adaption like this. Iroh and oddly enough Sokka carry the plot and the things that bring it down all have to do with the main plot. So ultimately if you can look past the weirdness of it all, it's a good time.","rating":"7\/10","date":"22 March 2024"}
{"title":"A retelling with a lot of heart, some flaws not enough episodes","review":"The original Avatar: the Last Airbender was one of my favourite series as a kid when it was first released, and I have only come to appreciate it more throughout the years. So I, like many, had a lot of reservations about a new live action remake.I'll start with the positives, as I really feel that these outweigh the choices I didn't agree with. The cast is phenomenal, I really felt their depictions of such beloved characters were true to the original show. The relationships between the core cast, specifically between Team Avatar and of course Zuko and Iroh, made me smile and I really appreciated the time spent on Sokka, Zuko and Iroh's arcs in particular. Ian Ousley and Dallas Liu who play Sokka and Zuko knock it out of the park, and the emotional scenes that Zuko and Iroh share really exemplify the heart of show that I've loved for so long. Expanding on the relationship between Zuko and his crew was also in my opinion an excellent choice.The show looks great for the most part, the costuming is so faithful and distinct to each character and the score is fantastic.Where I felt let down by the show was for the most part it's pacing - as you'll likely have read in multiple reviews multiple arcs from separate parts of the story are on several occasions thrust together when there is no reason for this other than the characters that appear had to appear in Book 1\/ season 1 somewhere. The writing of the show also suffers from 'show don't tell', by which I mean they overexplain plot points and on several occasions jokes, which for me made the some humour fall flat. I found this strange given the shows intention to take the show in a darker, more mature direction.This darker approach also impacted side characters such as King Bumi - gone is his pet Flopsy and instead of teaching his old friend lessons with mischievous charm Bumi is now bitter and jaded, making his scenes with Aang hard to watch at times (which may have been the point, but felt like a jarring change.A lot is left out, which when you condense 20 episodes into 8 this is to be expected. This new live action take makes it clear it is faithful to the original without being a shot for shot remake, and in many ways I appreciate that and many of the new additions were welcome ones. I laughed, I cried and I really hope they are renewed for second season as I can't wait to see what they do next!!!","rating":"8\/10","date":"26 February 2024"}
{"title":"Room for improve, but not as good as the animated show","review":"The pacing is a little rushed despite the fact that the length of the show is about as long as the original. The best parts of it were when the live action show did its own thing, and the worst parts were the references to the original. Some of the acting is good, some of it isn't. I think it's a fun fantasy show but as a live action remake of the legendary masterpiece it's alright. However, a lot of my complaints could be improved in the second season if they get greenlight. The weaker acting is mostly the child actors who are inexperienced. With more experience they could improve. Also, too much exposition, but in the second season it would be less necessary for new fans so they would cut it out. The pacing could be improved with more than 8 episodes, I think having at least 10 episodes could help the show. Certainly in Hollywood these 5-10 episode hour long movie like shows are not helping anyone. Not the production team or the audience. It's definitely an improvement from the movie, but for sure flawed.","rating":"","date":"22 February 2024"}
{"title":"As Good as It'll Get for a Live-Action Adaptation","review":"I was a huge fan of the animated show as a kid. I even remember when Nickelodeon had first announced that it was a new TV show back in the day. It was one of those once-in-a-lifetime type of cartoons that really sent home a lot of powerful life messages and entertained the young mind in a manner that felt natural - never forced. The caveat to all of this is that there were elements from the show that could only be made possible because of the animation and the incredible performances from the voice actors.Netflix's Avatar: The Last Airbender seeks to rewrite the horrid wrongs made by M. Night Shyamalan's 2010 disastrous adaptation of the source material. I'll start by saying it's not a perfect adaptation - by no means - and the avid fan can see where the source material breaks and sinks with the Netflix film-making formula. The performances from the actors all vary - some incredibly great - some not so good - but not terrible either. The story flows as well as it can - adapted from an animated show to a real life one.I think Gordon Cormier's performance as Aang was good and felt very in-line with how the original character was depicted. There were parts where I think he could've improved upon, but overall, I think the actor did a decent job for the script he had been given.Kiawentiio Tarbell's Katara felt less relatable than with the animated version of the character. I felt like there were some lines that fell flat, emotionless, and otherwise uncaring for the situation at hand. I think the performance improved as the show started to draw to a close, but I wouldn't say it's a terrible performance either.I thought Ian Ousley's performance as Sokka was incredibly good for how I remember the character. I think there were limits to how \"animated\" he could get without it becoming cringe or too cartoonish in a live-action, but for the spirit of who Sokka was in the animated show, Ian did a decent job channeling it here.My favorite performances ultimately came from Dallas James Liu's Zuko and Paul Sun-Hyung Lee's Uncle Iroh. While nobody can beat the original performances by Dante Basco and Mako\/Greg Baldwin respectively, I think those two were a powerhouse duo throughout the show. The character arc that Zuko had felt so impactful and highlighted Zuko's true honorable nature throughout and Iroh's great care for his nephew mirroring his own personal struggle of his own loss was really nice too.All-in-all, I think it's a pretty good show. I don't think I'll be rewatching it anytime soon - I'd rather just rewatch the anime - but it feels like the live adaptation that we should've gotten over a decade ago. It's not perfect, but I'd venture to say that it's good enough and I hope that some of the critique they get from this first season helps them refine a better second season.","rating":"7\/10","date":"6 March 2024"}
{"title":"I mean... I kind of love it?","review":"The pilot fell a little flat to me, not gonna lie - but episode 2 was pretty awesome. :)\nIt's kind of like they hadn't fully warmed up for episode 1 or something, because the quality rose significantly after that.And look, let's just all accept that there's never going to be a live action adaptation of ATLA that truly satisfies us. We love the original too much, it's just an impossible standard to keep up with.This adaptation is no exception. It doesn't 'quite' live up to its source material. But there are still things to love about it.The stunning cgi being one of them. The bending looks super cool. We all remember how it took like four earth benders to lift a single rock in the Shyamalan movie, which was laughable. In this adaptation, they're just as skilled with their elements as in the original. I appreciate that. Overall, it's an aesthetically pleasing series.I do agree with some of the other reviewers in regard to the acting, however. Some of the actors come across as a little inexperienced, especially in the pilot.But in their defence, I think the script sort of makes it difficult for them. Some of the dialogue falls flat, even when it's supposed to be super impactful and dramatic. Plenty of telling-instead-of-showing. It gets a little weird at times. Especially when some of the scenes lack a background soundtrack, so it's just them having straight-to-the-point conversations to the sound of wind. (This, too, got better after that first episode.)And despite the acting perhaps lacking every now and again, I think they managed to stay much truer to the original characters this time around, which I'm so happy about. Sokka is so much funnier and wittier than in the movie. I actually RECOGNISE him. :)\nSame goes for Aang. He's a lot better here than in the movie - brighter, happier, more prone to jokes. It's so great to see, after the super stern Sokka and very serious Aang in Shyamalan's version.I think they cast a really good Zuko, too! One of the best actors in the show, hands down.(The actress playing Katara could do with showing a bit more emotion though. Katara was always very expressive - here, she just sort of 'barely' reacts to what's going on around her, with only a few exceptions.)Unfortunately, episode 1 didn't make a great first impression, but I really urge you to give episode 2 a try. :)","rating":"8\/10","date":"22 February 2024"}
{"title":"It's Decent","review":"I have only finished the first episode, but I can already admit that it's MUCH better than the movie (that doesn't exist).It's not perect, particularly the acting. Aang's actor handles the action scenes very well, but his emotional moments and dramatic scenese are just bad. He has a good bit of Aang's free spirit attitude though so that's nice.The actions sequences, choreography, and cgi is very impressive and looks expensive. Glad they did it right. Gyatso was a terrific casting as well as some of the other choices including Iroh and Prince Zuko. Sokka and Katarra are not bad.Overall, it's something I'm definitely going to finish. As a big fan of the TV show, I was skeptical, particularly after the original showrunners quit due to creative differences, but this has been above average. It's not amazing or anything, but it's solidly good.","rating":"7\/10","date":"23 February 2024"}
{"title":"I love it","review":"Not sure why people are giving such bad reviews!! I do understand that - in comparison to the original - there are sone things that could be improved - but it also does things better! And as an absolut me fan of the original- it mostly holds true to it!!! Even some conversations are a one to one!!It is still a series that aims at a broad audience including kids - however, it is a bit more brutal and consequent than the anime. People actually die or are burned - and for me - that gives the plot more credibility and seriousness.And maybe thats what others are missing a bit - the lightness or fun that you had in the anime. Don't get me wrong though, it is still often funny and easy to watch.For me, it is a definite yes and I love it!Good animations, I like the acting, setting etc.Just watch it please, so there will be more episodes and I can have the full series as a live adaptation \u00f0\u0178\u02dc\u017d\u00f0\u0178\u02dc\u0160","rating":"9\/10","date":"14 April 2024"}
{"title":"Average execution, but maintains some of the original magic","review":"The show struggles to tell the original story with any degree of subtlety. It feels closer to being a literal explanation of the plot, rather than an entertaining journey of discovery\/character growth. Whether it was a conscious decision to water down the storytelling, or a failure of writing, is up for debate.In the first half of the series, the acting is wooden and the pace is rushed. It's structured more like a series of short stories, making it difficult to get truly engrossed. The second half definitely picks things up, particularly the last couple of episodes. There are a few sweet moments which capture some of the innocence of the original. The effects are also excellent throughout, especially in the fight scenes.Whilst the story telling is somewhat disappointing, and the dialogue is definitely oversimplified\/literal, there's enough here to make it a fun watch. It feels mostly aimed at a new\/young audience, so don't expect too much if you're a fan of the original series.","rating":"6\/10","date":"1 March 2024"}
{"title":"Brings a tear to my eye","review":"It's far from perfect and the cartoon will always be superior. I appreciate it'll be near impossible to redo the cartoon frame by frame and even though it doesn't follow the cartoon exactly, it's done a damn good job at telling the story and extracting the essence and spirit of the original show. Visuals are stunning and the cast are all so fitting, some of the acting is questionable but for kids that haven't had a whole lot of experience in the industry, they didn't make me cringe, so in my eyes that's decent enough and forgivable. (They're much better than the Harry Potter kids when they first started out.) The fighting scenes are all amazing and makes bending look so powerful and devastating, really enjoyable. Most definitely doesn't deserve the 1 star that some of the reviewers have given it, it's a million times better than that movie that shall not be named and watching it brought a nostalgic tear to my eye. Well done Netflix, keep them coming and I hope the series gets a finish and not axed prematurely like a lot of good shows because I can't wait to meet Toph!","rating":"8\/10","date":"22 February 2024"}
{"title":"Some hits and some misses","review":"Costumes, special effects, music, and most of the casting was done really well. I think the actors did a great job with what they were given.I also didn't mind that they combined storylines for time, but I feel like there was a lack of passion and pace that the original series had. As a huge fan of the original, I would have rather they just cut storyline in order for it to make sense and move more fluidly.Also, I felt the heavy reliance on CGI was more about flexing the budget and less about being accurate to the source material. I would have loved to see more material sets.I wanted more time with Aang, Katara, and Sokka initially so we can get to know and love them as we did in the original series. They feel like strangers in this series and that's sad to me. Also, not hating on the actress, but Katara's character is completely different. I'm not sure why that choice was made. I miss the original character.It's worth watching, but I'm not going to be showing this to anyone in place of the original show. I hope if they make a season 2, they take notes.","rating":"6\/10","date":"22 February 2024"}

While I liked seeing Kiyoshi early on, is it not supposed to be Roku as the first line of communication in the Avatar world?? It's almost like the guys who took over threw everything into a bowl, closed their eyes, and started picking events and characters to place in random order.

{"title":"No need to rush","review":"After waiting for so many years for this, I enjoyed every minute but...story is developing to fast. In animation there are stories that get us closer to characters which here is lacking especially with the character of Sokka. His comments and statements give him that special charm and unfortunately in the series that is not present.I have to say, visual effects are surprisingly good since I presume they made the series for children and not for us, adult fans. Azula is missing that maniacal expressionin her eyes but I realise that it is impossible to present the character in the same way like in animation.Definitely hoping that we won't have to wait 2 years for next season.","rating":"7\/10","date":"26 February 2024"}
{"title":"Advice: Watch with zero expectations","review":"I am a die hard fan of the original (rewatched it more times than I can count!) so I was a skeptic of this remake. I was nervous it would flop.BUT, coming in with ZERO expectations and watching this as if it's a completely different show allowed me to enjoy it for what it is: A NEW SHOW.It's inspired by the original but not the exact same thing. Just enough similarities for us to know and recognize the world and the characters but taking us on a completely different ride.The other reviewers who think it needs to be like the original, need to take a backseat. It's impossible to recreate the animation in plot, character development and more.This show will give the variety we Avatar fans crave: Variety. I'm glad it's not a total carbon copy of the original. That way, I can come back to this show for some real life action. And back to the animation for the narrative.What it gives us is what we (as kids turn adults) who love the show what we've always wanted, to watch what bending looks like in real life.","rating":"9\/10","date":"19 March 2024"}

{"title":"Surprisingly, this is actually quite good","review":"If you finish episode 3 (amazing episode) and are not hooked by that point.....idk what to tell you or what more they could have done. Bizarrely, episode 3 has a lower user score than episode 1 and 2.... i think it's because of some of the changes they made to\nthe story but those changes were brilliant. It was impressive how they took characters and plot points from different episodes and weaved them together. But then people hate on it for not mindlessly sticking to a 1:1 replica of the cartoon.Honestly this show looks awesome, the sets, the colours, it's absolutely magnificent. The action scenes are epic in terms of fight choreography and the cgi for the bending is highly impressive.Regarding the script. Sure there's occasional weak lines- eg Katara telling Jet \"You are the bad guy\" and too many mentions of \"we need to save the world\". But overall the dialogue is pretty good. There's even some beautifully written dialogue in scenes which didn't exist in the original. Or perhaps there's a slightly different interpretation of a certain characters mindset and i was often impressed with the writing.People say the humour and charm are gone but they're wrong. They writers have created a fairly serious\/dramatic live-action, but there's still a colourful vibe and some funny\/wholesome moments dispersed throughout episodes. People complaining that Aang is too mature......eh it's kinda a weak criticism tbh. He is mature but he often has this childlike glowing look of excitement. I like how much energy his actor brings to the role even if occasionally it feels a bit forced.I'm often fairly critical of most modern shows tbh, but i actually had pretty high expectations because this is a valuable and beloved series. Episode 1 was a little wobbly for me in terms of storytelling and acting, but once i got into episodes 2 and 3 my high expectations were met and sustained till the end.I'm happy that we have this series which takes some creative liberty, while also being faithful to the spirit and message of the original cartoon.If the writers are reading this, go ahead and be as creative as you want about how to tell the story in season 2. Seriously go for it, because I'm a big fan of the cartoon... and the DIFFERENCES are what is making this most interesting for me.The people obsessed with having a 1:1 replica are a heavy minority of the viewership.

{"title":"Wow! So much fun!","review":"First off, thank GOSH this isn't anything CLOSE to the 2010 movie! Lol. Overall, Netflix, I thank you. This is about as close as you can get to live action vs animation. The small pitfalls, so far, are in regard to casting and some choices made to which characters to cast. Most of the Avatar audience, imo, have \"grown up\" by now but they still made a few casting choices that are for, well, the younger audience.I didn't grow up watching the cartoon but I did find it and Korra about 6 years ago and absolutely LOVE the cartoons. So, going into this I was skeptical and hopeful. Imo, they delivered. This version does feel like a live action of the cartoon we all love. The feel of this is great. The CGI is absolutely awesome! Sokka, lmao, that was spot on casting. Same with Aang. Most of the acting and casting is really good. Katara, imo, falls a little short. Her acting is pretty dry tbh. It gets better at times and during others you can really feel her lack of experience.Don't get me wrong guys, this isn't perfect. There are things to be nit picky about. But, comparing this to other failed live-actions, or live actions where they took their own liberties with it, this one feels like Netflix stayed true to the source material and I thank you for that! I can't wait for future seasons!!!Kyoshi Island, wow! Lol.. I won't say any more. :)","rating":"7\/10","date":"24 February 2024"}

But they're expected since their newer actors Gordon literally has like only one scene before this show lol. But he does portray his innocence well and his acting is good for someone in his technically first role. Dallas (Zuko ) and Ian (Sokka ) were the real standoutsThe production, in terms of cgi , sets and bending was overall really good. When Aang goes into the avatar state it generally does look kinda scary in a way. The fight scenes were prob my fav part , they do a great job at handling them , and I really that they did a fight scene that didn't really feature much bending between 2 powerful bendersThere is actually a lot of changes , some I might not like but i 100% get or just others I might have to fully understand on a rewatchBut even tho it's def more serious then the original there's still some of that innocence of the original'sI'll say this tho , just give it a shot and come in with an open mind . If u come in expecting a straight 1 of 1, or for it to be as good as the original , then ur not gunna like it. I've seen some reviews where it's just getting compared to the original, which wouldn't really be that fair since the original is perfection to many ppl and others where u can tell ppl are just upset that it's not a 1 of 1.

{"title":"Pretty solid adaptation","review":"I've watched the original animated series multiple times and always enjoy it, so obviously there was some doubt when a live-action series was announced; however, those doubts were cast aside when I started watching the first episode. It's a pretty solid adaptation and I've been enjoying it (currently on episode 7).The casting is great with some standing out more than others (love seeing Amber Midthunder!), but a lot of these actors have had little screen time before this, so I'm willing to give them time to grow. The writing in general is faithful to the original but the creators also make adjustments to compliment the transition to live-action; honestly, if it was a 100% recreation I don't think it could work. The tone is slightly heavier in this series, so yes some of Aang's childishness is lost, but I'm liking it.Overall: great show.

The first episode alone kept me smiling from start to finish. It not only stays true to the original animated series, but also offers some surprises for both longtime fans and newcomers alike. The performances are really good. The tone is just right. The visuals are stunning. The action sequences are emotionally engaging. The cliffhanger definitely leaves you wanting more. Here's hoping this proves to be successful enough to give us a second season. Please don't let the mixed nor negative reviews persuade you from not giving this a chance. Please give this a watch.","rating":"8\/10","date":"23 February 2024"}
{"title":"Surprisingly Good Effort...","review":"It's got to be a herculean effort to try and recreate the magic of a cartoon world in a live action format, and this really was a good effort with stunning visuals and true to the source physical motions when we see bending scenes. The firebenders in particular bring a shocking brutality to a world which has been at war for a hundred years. Not for kids in that respect.If one is expecting a cartoon, watch the original which is truly a work of art. The whimsy and joy of it can't be recreated in a story that tries to show us a real world version.I will say that even though so much was well done and involved, a lot felt rushed. This effort tried to take a 20-episode \"book\", and pack it into 8, and while I admit, that there were some areas in which this kind of editing won't show in the long run, it does feel like it's being pushed along too quickly.As far as the cast goes, there are some brilliant spots, particularly in the adult performances, and the kids don't do too badly for the most part. That said, I think more care could have been taken with casting to better match the characters, not necessarily in looks but in individuality. There's not a whole lot of \"x-factor\" there. Aang and Sokka are bright spots, but the rest of the cast looks like they're interchangeable. Hopefully, they'll improve over time.There was one other weird, noticeable thing to mention. The costumes are incredibly clever - but way too clean. Possibly some sort of deliberate homage to the cartoon? The hairstyles for Gran Gran and Yue are unbelievably unrealistic and Sokka's necklace makes him look like Pebbles Flintstone, so one wonders if these are cartoon affectations. The sets themselves bring us back to familiar territory, as do occasional bits of dialogue.Overall, this was an enjoyable series. I hope it's continued.","rating":"7\/10","date":"23 February 2024"}
{"title":"I usually type long reviews, but I feel empty after watching this...","review":"I usually type my review out long and detailed, but I love the OG show so much and after watching this adaptation I dont feel like bashing this just out of my love for the source material and cus this was bland.But if I was to TL;DR it - Same ol same ol,Same old Netflix being Netflix\njust rushing motivations and character development scenes only to replace it with expository paragraph like stilted and flat dialogue just so they can get to that Key high points in the story without the actual soul of the journey.No humor or joy in scenes that were taken from OG but twisted around to be exposition, and where there is humor it feels mean spirited or cringe or just humor in places that makes no sense and confuses you more than anything so you dont really find it funny.This was disappointing and I feel empty.Far Better than the movie but that is a low bar to clear.Episode 6,7,8 sat in a MF bullet train just to get to the end, they could have easily made book 1 into Two seasons to get the characters fleshed out and added more emotion to the journey.Maybe I should thank the stars that they didnt shove more into it like they did for Yu Yu Hakusho Live action where they rammed 60 Episodes into 5 live action.Conclusion - People who have never seen this will love it since it is still adapting excellent and amazing storybeats from the OG. People who love the OG will not find any joy or soul in this.","rating":"5\/10","date":"22 February 2024"}
{"title":"It is a failure - again","review":"I know it is hard to bring the series into a live-action format. But everything which is important to this story was cut or left out. They should have stayed with the original creators and let them form a good series. This would have meant a bigger investment, but it would have been paid-out.They changed parts of the story, casted not so good actors, took the dramaturgy and comedian aspects of the story and saved money for the animation of the elements and animals. Also they added aspects, which did not fit, just for the sake of equality.The whole season 1 felt like a compromise which could not met the expectations - again.I had no expectations after the movie in 2010 and still I was dissapointet. All in all I did not enjoy the season 1.Would not recommend to anyone.","rating":"6\/10","date":"20 April 2024"}
{"title":"Unshared opinion","review":"First of all: it is \"Appa, yip yip\" to make the Appa fly!!!! Not \"Appa, yip yip\" while being up in the air..... This almost made me turn-off the serie.If you haven't seen the anime it is a really good serie with beautiful special effects & I would definitely recommend it to you!On the other hand, if you did watch the anime you will notice huge flaws in some character developments where I will focus my opinion on Sokka, Aang & Katara. The chemistry between these 3 characters isn't the same in the anime. They erased Sokka's personality & replaced it with a ideal version of how it should be in 2024. Which is a big loss on humor & teaching moments such as character growth. Katara & Aang's love at first sight got erased aswel which makes the dynamic between the 3 very different. Wish they made Aang's character more similar to the anime, being a goofball & always looking for fun riding animals goofing around.Last but not least Bumi & Iroh are spot on perfect!!!","rating":"8\/10","date":"27 February 2024"}
{"title":"Definitely not terrible.","review":"As with all live-action adaptations, it can never be perfect. There will certainly be haters of this adaptation just like another one of Netflix's productions (One Piece), and though it seems like other reviews would say that \"you will find this show terrible if you cared\", I've been a long-time fan of the show and I don't think that it was completely terrible. Could they have done better? Absolutely. The kids' acting was so-so but these are very young actors and they probably spent a lot of time practicing stunts than acting workshops -- and they can still learn a lot. I was expecting it not to be an exact copy of the animation, which was nice because they did spend some time on things that the animated version didn't. Script writing could definitely be improved but they had some good parts.","rating":"7\/10","date":"28 February 2024"}
{"title":"You won't get a better live adaptation then this.","review":"Hey, I get it. You're a true fan of the series, but as a fan you also need to realize that any series made into a live adaptation will never be as good as you dreamed it would be. The amount of character development can't be equal to a book or a cartoon series where the first chapter of 20 episodes is compressed into only 8 episodes. It's not realistic to expect that.What I can say, is this comes close to being the best live adaptation of a series I have ever seen and what I believe we will ever get. When do you think, this is ever going to happen again? Would you rather be willing to wait another 18 years before seeing something like this or would you sit back and enjoy it in this moment?There are some parts of the CGI that does look a bit weird for me, but the fight scenes and the bending are amazing! I expected only a small amount of bending but boy was I wrong. I feel the story is told well enough for the time it is given. Being unfamiliar with the story will give any new avatar watchers the entire explanation they need and make them want to go read the book or watch the cartoon series. The characters play the perfect part, and you see the resemblance in some of them. So much so that I almost fell over in my chair a couple of times seeing them for the first time.My advice for you is just enjoy it. If you don't like it then go watch the cartoon series, but I know you would rather be watching this!","rating":"9\/10","date":"23 February 2024"}
{"title":"Not perfect but also not bad","review":"The series isn't perfect, but it's not bad either. The netflix show does not adapt the original series one-to-one but takes various plots from the original series, puts them together into a new familiar story and tells back stories that are not shown in the original series. However, the main plot of book one is hardly changed. Some changes were very risky. In my opinion they could have used more than 8 episodes. That way they could have improved the story and it wouldn't have felt rushed. The best thing about the series is the cinematography, the effects and of course the bending. The serious tone of the series gives the war a certain weight, which is interesting for the worldbuilding. Some of the characters are also well done, and some characters might evolve in the second season. The series still has potential and could correct a lot of things in the second season.","rating":"7\/10","date":"27 February 2024"}
{"title":"If You Don't Like It... Rewatch the Orginal","review":"There's no perfect way to recreate a beloved animated series come to life in a live action format. But this comes close and is so good. Not only is it faithful to what the original series was and tried to convey, but it adds even more lore and detail to the whole storyline. Perfect doesn't mean it's exactly the same. I'd be bored if it was the exact same story. It's 80% the same, 20% new, and 100% faithful. I'm really confused by the posters that act like this isn't faithful or doesn't do the original show justice.I really enjoyed this and I can't wait for the next two seasons. And I'll rewatch the animated series again in the meantime!","rating":"8\/10","date":"9 March 2024"}
{"title":"They try to put it all in one","review":"The story of Aang in the animated series is so much bigger then the story this serie can tell. They try to put a lot of story in 1 season, with makes it never better then the animated one.For example, the story behind the tunnels under Omshu (\u00f0\u0178\u017d\u00b6SeCrEt TunNNnNeL \u00f0\u0178\u017d\u00b6) is different, with is sad.I did enjoy the serie and I hope there will be a season 2 soon. I really want to know how this story ends, how Aang is going to save the world. I also want to know if the (in this serie) very hot Jet will return. I really hope so.I also want to say that Yue in this real life serie is better. She has more layers here.","rating":"7\/10","date":"1 March 2024"}
{"title":"Not bad at all...","review":"So my first step into TLA world was the horrible, 2010 movie. I didn't watch the animated show until last year, but I will say, this new show does do justice to the animated show. While I wouldn't quite put it on the same level (because it's always difficult to beat the original version of any show), it's not too far off, and it's a thousand times better than the 2010 movie. While this new show isn't exactly 100% in line with the animated show, it is close enough that you don't really notice it. The SFX aren't too over done to the point of being ridiculous, and the writing was done so that it was able to condense a 20 episode animated season, into 8 episodes and not really miss anything (unlike how the movie did..). Can't wait for season 2.","rating":"8\/10","date":"27 February 2024"}
{"title":"Atleast we can all agree, Good and bad from different points of views.","review":"If you have seen the original then obviously the Netflix version looks really bad in comparison.It skips important scenes, the acting is missing passion, and the emotions and comedy we know from the original is not even close.But, this is not the original, it is a new version compressed to 8 episodes.I believe that those who has never seen Avatar: The last airbender, will love this Netflix version because the effects and cgi is actually really good.I Think we have the technology to make a good real life replica of the Original, but for most of the Original fans its not good enough.All in all, im disappointed about the result, but i love the effects and the modernization.Should have spent more on acting and redoing certain seances in my opinion.","rating":"","date":"27 April 2024"}
{"title":"My honest opinion? The lower reviews are nitpicky","review":"I have been a fan of Avatar since I was a kid. I went into this adaptation expectong something that was not going to be a 1:1 adaptation. We've been told there would be changes for about a year. If you go in expecting the original, you may not like it. If you watch it with an open mind and as it's own canon, you may enjoy it. I definitely didThe visuals and bending are stunning, there are some changes for character interactions and storytelling, but it is not bad as long as you don't expect it to be the exact same as the cartoonEpisode 1 starts a bit meh, but episode 2 is where it really picks up on feel of the OG series.The characters are not as good as the OG, but that is to be expected.It is a good, but not amazing series. It is fun to watch. Wish I could give an 8.5, but alas.","rating":"7\/10","date":"23 February 2024"}
{"title":"Too rushed and soulless","review":"I tried to like this, but with only 8 episodes there's not a lot to work with. The pacing is way too fast. If the movie didn't exist, this show would be getting all the hate that got.This season was supposed to be \"Book 1: Water\" and Aang didn't even attempt to learn it.The fact that they combined Jet + Teo and his father + Omashu all into one place is just ridiculous. We're supposed to see Aang and his friends go around the world exploring. There's supposed to be a balance between having fun + trying to focus on being the Avatar.The show just feels soulless to me. Some of the actors just feel like they're reading off a card. We barely get any time to bond with the characters and go through the journey with them. There's barely any character development. Thanks to Netflix only making 8 episodes.I really wish the directors or whoever nowadays STOP making shows with only 8-10 episodes a season and then making us wait 2-3 years for the next mediocre\/bland season. That's exactly what's going to happen here for seasons 2 and 3.Overall, this show is disappointing and very rushed. People that haven't watched the cartoon (are there people who haven't??) need to forget this exists and just watch that instead. I have a feeling this is going to be like the Witcher, which Netflix ruined too (that was TRASH), just go play the game or read the book!","rating":"5\/10","date":"23 February 2024"}
{"title":"Good with Flaws","review":"This time around, the real life adaptation of Avatar The Last Airbender hit the right spot, even if it's not at equal par with the original yet.The 8 episodes of The Book of Water was pretty dang close, but several points kinda missing.Saka became a comedic but understanding character was not 100%. Having to replace his father at young teenager age, Saka has bitter and very sarcastic rude comments here and there in the original series. Here, it's just comedic one liners without offending anyone. The point of showing his rude sarcastic personality was to gradually show growth in him because he will lead the water bender regardless having no bending power.Uncle Iroh was played okay by Soon-Hyung Lee, but missing 1 side of personality, the jolly old man side. Lee, being a dramatic actor, has all feature visually and well acted almost all part of Iroh personality, but he just couldn't do the jolly old man side right.Daniel Dae Kim was brilliant, playing the main villain with internal doubt trying to show his son that he cared. In fact Daniel did it better than the original drawing.The kids were great, especially Aang characterization. The challenge of playing Aang was never the martial art of childish behavior, but Aang was always filled with sadness due to missing 100 years and lost all the people he grew up with. The movie failed to illustrated this sad part.Let's see if Netflix made the second season.","rating":"7\/10","date":"23 February 2024"}
{"title":"Can't wait for season 2","review":"I've been a fan of AtLA for a while and we watch the live-action show with my daughter. The special effects are fire, and the story is told in a different way than the original show, which brings a new way of seeing it. It's different, but if the original show hadn't existed, we would still be all catched up. I love the new dimension brought to the characters and would not change it for nothing. It's a kid show, and still have this essence. Some felt off, like Gran Gran hairs or some effects like Appa flying, but it's still wonderful. I think the cast is wonderfully chosen and I will be watching it again.","rating":"8\/10","date":"26 February 2024"}
{"title":"Only ridiculous expectations can make this seem like a bad show.","review":"It's been a few weeks since this show came out and I've finally finished it. Since pretty much day one after this came out, I have seen so many videos pop up in my youtube feed criticizing the show, saying how dumb it is, ranking all the worst parts, etc. It kind of blew my mind how it seemed like everybody was just immediately ready to tear it to shreds, so I went into it with some trepidation, but still cautiously excited. Now that I've finished, I think most of the people who are extremely critical really had unrealistic expectations. And maybe I would have felt the same if I hadn't tempered my own expectations before watching it, since I recently rewatched the original, so it's fresh in my mind. Now that I've finished this new take on it, overall I really enjoyed it a lot! I'm very excited for the next two seasons.This show isn't perfect, the biggest issue is that Katara is not nearly as fierce as in the original. A lot of people have already mentioned her somewhat emotionless portrayal here, and that's hard to deny. I did see a video of Kiawentiio's original audition tape for the part, and I completely see why they cast her. I'm not sure what happened between then and filming, but I doubt it's entirely her fault and I have hope that they can remedy this in later seasons.Other than that, I felt like all the other cast members really fit their characters impressively well. I thought Aang was great, he was able to be serious when that was called for but was still a fun-loving kid like in the original. Ozai was crazy intimidating, Zhao was delightfully slimy, Uncle Iroh was such a sweetheart. I was kind of amazed how perfect Sokka's casting was, he even sounds like the original actor. I hope they add some more humorous moments for him in the future, or at least make his comical moments more funny. I understand that this medium has less comedy potential and I wasn't expecting it to nearly measure up to the original, but given how absolutely brilliant the writing for the original Sokka was, I hope they can step it up at least a bit for him in later seasons. I was still pretty satisfied with how he was in this version given the overall different tone, but Sokka was my favorite character in the original and he wasn't even a contender for my favorite here. But that's mostly because of my absolute favorite part of this adaptation...\nI'm lowkey obsessed with this version of Prince Zuko. Every scene with him in it is a highlight. The best episodes were the ones with more of him and his backstory. His action scenes are extremely cool, his acting is very nuanced and full of emotion, his backstory is fleshed out even more than the original, his relationship with Uncle Iroh made me feel so much emotion and brought me to tears more than once. I will admit, when I first saw the trailer I was thinking, \"this guy doesn't look like the original Zuko, I'm disappointed.\" But after actually seeing him in action, I take back that thought. He's absolutely the best thing in the show and it's not even close. I love that in this version, you get to see more clearly early on in the show that Zuko really is a good guy with such a good heart, and literally everything bad about him came from his evil, abusive father. He was already one of the best written characters I've ever seen, with the absolute best redemption arc I've ever seen, and they did him justice here.So, bottom line is, you should give this show a fair chance and enjoy it without comparing it too harshly with the original.Also Dallas Liu's performance is worth like 5 of the stars I gave the show haha.","rating":"8\/10","date":"17 March 2024"}

I really feel for the hardcore fans who waited years on this and understand their dissapointment. Having said that, also a more positive noteStill I finished the season and had to admit some chars grow on you still.

{"title":"Its not a perfect 10 like the OG show, but its better than a 7 for me","review":"The animated series, for those who are and are not interested in animated shows, is quite obviously a masterpiece both critically and within pop culture. However, what I love about this series existing is that it opens the world we all love visually while I believe it keeps the spirit, maintains my happiness while watching, and opening up to a live action interested audience possibly persuaded to watch the OG show after this first season piques their interest. I think the OG series will be seen as the true canon still and this series will be seen as the story with less details. Thats the unfortunate part. I love how more people with different tastes can like something that lets people relate with one another no matter their preference in live action or animated. People are threatened that this will replace the animated series but it will bolster it. I'm excited to see how they do the next seasons which will surely be coming.","rating":"8\/10","date":"26 February 2024"}

Although the bending, many of the casting and editing was great, the show still didn't satisfy me. I absolutely hate how they changed the characters like Katara, Aang and Sokka. They totally misunderstood the characters and the writing totally sucked. The characters seemed dull\/to different from the original atla. The acting was also mid, many of the actors did a great job while others just felt awkward.I was happy that they didn't completely copy the og, but changing the characters made no sense what's so ever.","rating":"6\/10","date":"4 March 2024"}
{"title":"When is chapter 2","review":"I really enjoyed the show. It was a bit fast and a bit more edgy than playful like the animated. I personally felt like it should have been more episodes per season like 13 instead of 8. At least there would be a bit more whimsy. It was definitely been than the film by 1 mil. Miles better. But the some of the power of aang was dimmed down. Soka, I felt that his love was really powerful, you saw the strong connection between him and Suki. Katara her power was real, but I didn't see her kindness and how naive she was, now you see more of her cunning and her strength instead of it coming in later. But overall I would definitely watch it again all the way through.","rating":"8\/10","date":"8 March 2024"}

Sadly they haven't given the time.The series feels sadly so rushed! As spectator you get hardly no time to laugh, to cry, to be amazed or to breathe between scenes. There's no time for the character arcs.Because it's so rushed it is like seeing The Amber Island players from the animated series in a real action movie. They had great visuals, as well as a whiny Katara and a hilarious Sokka, Avatarstate YIPYIP!Very watchable but be prepared for a bit of cringe if you're a fan of the animated version.","rating":"6\/10","date":"25 February 2024"}
{"title":"It is hard to watch when you care","review":"The subtle nuances are completely gone. The iconic moment where Katara gets emotional and breaks the ice is now replaced with her trying to bend the boat back? The complexity or story telling that sets up their arcs from children to adults is now not there. Why did Aang just go up there to think about stuff? HE RAN AWAY. The whole point of his journey is accepting responsibility and that begins with running away!Aang's character is told through other people instead of him being it. What is happening with the writing? I'm so frustrated watching this.The only nice thing are the visuals, but apart from that it misses the heart and complexity that made the original iconic.Also it's just not funny. It is so scared to try to be offensive or say the wrong things or be disliked, it ended up being corporate and soulless.","rating":"5\/10","date":"23 February 2024"}
{"title":"Why ruin it!","review":"Very poor acting from most of them. Most importantly no emotion.. it feels like they just had to make something and they did. No engagement. Also, they tried to bring Indian culture here to the series which is poor choice and stop adding the things that doesn't go at all. Why remake something if you can't even make it right! This is not close to anything to the original show. Original show had more engagement humor story.. this is something just they just it for the name to make some money.

The animation will always reign supreme, as we all expected, but this was an enjoyable watch. Small inconsistencies in the story and some rushed plot lines aside, this was a fun show. It had that familiar light heartedness yet serious nature that made the animation so timeless, the bending techniques and visual effects were absolutely phenomenal, and I honestly think everyone did a great job with the roles they portrayed. I think the most important thing is it felt like it had heart. Though it wasn't perfect, it was enjoyable and I hope to see the next 2 books adapted in the future.","rating":"8\/10","date":"23 February 2024"}

This live action remake is plagued by unbelievable acting. At times I found myself wondering if I was watching a powerful character in a magical land, or just a valley girl who thinks it's cute to mouth breathe.The villains lack the villainy that draws the audience into the story line and makes them root for the heroes.Overall the special effects are impressive, but it appears to be a widely delegated project that at times doesn't tie together well. One scene in particular, a flying scene shows the characters moving at a speed far too fast for the overall speed of the film, followed by heavy fog that appears to have been added to cloak the lackluster effects. The scene was rendered fuzzy and notably distracting.It's worth a watch, but my oh my... The squandered potential is disappointing.","rating":"6\/10","date":"2 March 2024"}

I made it through the first season (thrice!) fully invested and entertained. This rendition brings Avatar into adult-hood. While it did a good job of maintaining some of the silliness that ricocheted Avatar into fandom, it incorporated more mature and violent action scenes and adult concepts that I appreciated. Some of the acting was sub-par, but nothing that I couldn't move past. Overall, it was a success to me! . And I'm really happy that Netflix renew it for 2 seasons, I hope they do better job in VFX and terms of more episodes, cause the real events begin now!","rating":"10\/10","date":"23 March 2024"}
{"title":"A Fresh Look at \"Avatar: The Last Airbender\" (2024-)","review":"Stepping into the world of \"Avatar: The Last Airbender\" (2024-) as a complete newbie is like being dropped into a high-flying airbender race - thrilling, disorienting, and utterly unpredictable. While the captivating story itself soars, some aspects deserve a closer look with a healthy dose of humor.Let's start with the visuals. The show's special effects team deserves a round of applause for conjuring up some breathtaking displays of elemental bending. Fire dances, water twirls, and earth...well, earths. However, at times, the digital landscapes feel a bit like stepping onto a giant green screen, momentarily pulling you out of the immersive experience. It's like watching a behind-the-scenes featurette accidentally spliced into the final cut.The characters themselves are a curious bunch. While the writing gives them a solid foundation, some of the portrayals, particularly Aang's, haven't quite mastered the art of emotional connection. Let's just say, their tearbending skills could use some work. In some scenes, it felt like watching a group of talented actors rehearsing rather than fully embodying their roles. It's like attending a play where the actors keep forgetting their lines, but the set design is fantastic.Despite these observations, \"Avatar: The Last Airbender\" (2024-) still manages to hold your attention. The story remains engaging, and the visual spectacle, when it hits its mark, is truly impressive. If you're a die-hard fan of the original series, approach this with an open mind and a sense of humor. For newcomers, it's a decent introduction to the world of bending, but don't expect to be completely swept off your feet (unless you're Aang, of course).","rating":"7\/10","date":"27 February 2024"}

A great additional way to watch this tale.The purists will never be happy, those that grew up will never have the same connection but if you have never watched this before and you like super hero movies or even simply action movies then this may be for you.

Although this follows an already established story, the writers did a good job showing us a different take. This just shows how deep the original story was. I believe it is the story that will bring this series forward rather than its visuals and acting. Not saying that the visuals here are bad, it's also well done. The action sequences are also good for a series. I heard the actors\/actresses did a workshop on tai chi and wu shu before filming. Explains how their movements are not sloppy. The characters, well, they could have used a more appealing Azula. Overall, this series is on the likable side.","rating":"7\/10","date":"25 February 2024"}

The original cartoon is something I grew up with and have watched two times in my adult life. It's a masterpiece.Netflix's live-action remake is like your partner spending months trying to paint the Mona Lisa. They did their homework, tried their best, and spent a ton of time working on it. You are then showed the final result and can't help but respect their effort. Are there faults? Absolutely. But would it be fair to compare my girlfriend to Leonardo da Vinci? No. I mean, she can barely draw a stick figure.Basically, what I'm trying to say is that this recreation was never going to hold up to the original. But it does include a decent level of respect regarding the original source material. There were moments watching this where I cringed. But there were just as many where I got chills and thought, \"God damn, they have really done it.\"All in all, I genuinely hope they carry on with this incredible show, but also learn from their mistakes and improve with each season.","rating":"8\/10","date":"26 February 2024"}
{"title":"A lot is perfect, except the most important.","review":"Normally I don;t even write reviews, but I just came here to say that a lot about this live remake is very well done the effects, world, character visualisation. Except there is a big stinker. The dialogue seems almost inhumane most of the times, it sometimes even feels like they misinterpret the relationships between some of the characters.When the connection between characters and acting seems fine I am enjoying the show, however the acting is mostly not that.Especially the first episode is hard to watch in my oppinion, after that you get used to the way of acting but it still is not something you can get used to completely.I feel like the producers were so close to something amazing (Which can be so hard with these kinds of remakes) yet now so far from it.","rating":"6\/10","date":"23 February 2024"}
{"title":"Literally have no emotions","review":"I don't even know why people are compare this with the film. The original comes from a cartoon. After seeing this I say just watch the original. They erased all the emotion and humor when making this series. Besides, people don't talk logically and most things are cringe. The fire lord explains his entire plan and the character understands it after an hour. Not only did they remove the Aang's breakdown from a scene, but they also made him look like someone who is afraid of taking responsibility and just wants to play games. What was important to him here was not playing games, but his friends. I still don't understand how you completely deleted these emotional things. I don't understand why they changed a perfect script. If you want something more mature and something that have humor, different emotions, watch the original. Netflix should give us new things instead of ruining good things.","rating":"3\/10","date":"22 February 2024"}
{"title":"Something Missing","review":"They seem to have captured the base elements of the original show but something is missing. There doesn't seem to be the heart, emotion and comedy (Iroh specifically) that we expected. The relationships between characters are distant and bland, especially between Katara and Sokka. The only relationship I enjoyed was between Iroh and Zuko, it felt emotional enough but it does need the comedy of the original..There are good elements, the effects and World building is amazing but hopefully they realise where they've gone wrong if we get a second season (although knowing Netflix it's unlikely)..","rating":"7\/10","date":"24 February 2024"}
{"title":"An enjoyable retelling","review":"As a life long fan of the series, I was nervous given the past. Having watched all of Netflix's adaptation I am more than happy.The casting is spot on, the heart and soul of the series is there. Some excellent additions which really give depth to our main characters much earlier in the story and I generally like the decisions made to streamline and combine elements from different animation episodes. The bending is well executed and the VFX are pleasing to watch.While this does not reach the heights of the original, after all it is one of the best animations of all time. It is an enjoyable retelling of this most beloved story which respects the past but tries to forge its own path and as with all stories, they adapt and change was they passed down and retold.I cannot wait to return to this world and see how they retell\/adapt the story going forward. So fingers crossed Netflix follows through to the end. And I really need to see a live action Toph.Bring on season 2.","rating":"8\/10","date":"29 February 2024"}
{"title":"You cannot rush perfection","review":"Apparently it's even harder to recreate it. We have characters and stories we have loved for years and it seems that those who created this version do not share that love. Heart, subtlety, innocent mixed with humor, and the art of storytelling can't simply be replaced by graphics and visuals. We as fans wanted more from this production. We've waited for this recreation and I guess our wait continues. The show is not without its merits and entertainment value but is lacking in the emotion, the intelligence the hidden words and gems of wisdom. The Avatar had been lost for 100 years, let's hope that it does not take another 100 years to truly find him again.","rating":"6\/10","date":"29 February 2024"}
{"title":"The closest thing to an accurate live action adaption","review":"The detail, characters, animals, surroundings and VFX is insane and makes me feel like a little kid again. Some of the castings were a bit questionable to me but also loved many of the castings quickly. Sokka is my favourite, just as in the animation. The humour is there but subtle. However, the storyline does feel rushed. It's understandable that recreating over 60 episodes of 20 minutes without slacking on the effects is difficult. So I do hope this season opens a window to create a bigger budget for the next season. A few episodes more to add more to the story and seeing Aang more as the main character. Because I am looking forward to season 2!","rating":"8\/10","date":"28 February 2024"}
{"title":"It is NOT the cartoon","review":"Netflix Avatar the Last Airbender Live-Action Review (SPOILER FREE)\nThis is all simply my opinion as a fan of the series having grown up watching the show and following the Gaang throughout the years.Acting (6\/10): not the best and very easy to see that it was the first film\/work for many of the cast. The veterans such as Daniel Dae Kim, Paul Sun Hyung Lee, George Takei, and Hiro Kanagawa to name a few, deliver very good performances for their respective roles.Story (3\/10): loosely follows the original story from the cartoon, but with a lot of events and characters left out or moved out of chronological order leaving a story that was a shell of what it was supposed to be with a feeling of being rushed unnecessarily.Bending (5\/10): better than Shyamalan's live action with good choreography but does not stay true to the original martial arts disciplines that the cartoon based each bending off of.CGI\/World Building (7\/10): good reconstructions and designs of each city and village. Definitely felt like they followed the original Asian culture and world building that was in the cartoon, however there was not a lot of opportunity to get to admire and enjoy the world as the series progressed.Writing (7\/10): good dialogue and references to the original show, however, the deliveries fell short and the depth\/emotion for the characters was lacking.Overall worthy of a 6\/10. If you are looking for an accurate true to the cartoon story, then you will be disappointed (though not as much as the movie). If you approach it with an open mind and are willing to take a new idea on the world of Avatar, then it can be enjoyable and good.","rating":"6\/10","date":"23 February 2024"}
{"title":"So Far So Good","review":"I've only just started watching this series. I'm on S01E03 and I really like it. A good balance of drama and action. The Special Effects are done well.I haven't watched the animated show, so don't know if it's following that.It has a really good plot-line, and keeps the attention of the viewer. It seems to be a fast paced series, so I don't think it will make more than this one season. But you never know, maybe they will try to stretch it out a bit.The characters are engaging and the performances are well done. The back scene is very engaging. I imagined I was at some of the locations.I'll be watching future episodes and hope they stay up to this review.","rating":"9\/10","date":"24 February 2024"}
{"title":"Great Adaptation, with some minor flaws","review":"The positive of the show is that I feel like I am immersed into the setting. I feel like i am watching ATLA. This is something a lot of adaptations now a days are getting wrong. They try and rework so much where you loose the feeling of what was originally created.There are some flaws here and there but honestly, if you are watching the show to find those flaws you will not like this show.If you just watch it to watch it, you really wont notice them which is a great positive!Unfortuantly, you can not adapt the cartoon style of story telling into a movie as cartoons allow the characters to be more expressive.I think they did their best in over exagerating the main, characterists of the character.","rating":"7\/10","date":"23 February 2024"}
{"title":"Guys where are these instant bad ratings coming from??","review":"I have rewatched the cartoon countless times since I was a 5 year old child. Being 22 now and holding this show near and dear to me, I can say the episodes I have watched so far have been GREAT. I don't know how there could possibly be this many bad reviews already! Again, I've only finished the first couple of episodes but so far it's awesome - the acting is good, casting is GREAT, the special effects are good, there is a good mix of humor and seriousness. Much more grown up than the cartoon too. Give it a frickin chance people. I really cannot understand how there could possibly already be so many bad reviews when the show was literally released today. There were bad reviews before the amount of time it would take to watch the whole thing was up. Jokers.","rating":"9\/10","date":"23 February 2024"}
{"title":"A show most definitively for kids!","review":"I have just finished watching the first season of Avatar: the last airbender. Full disclosure, I have watched the animation series before, but I don't remember it all that well. And also last Monday I finished watching the terrible season 4 true detective finale (It's so nice to see a series with an actual story and character development!). Anything I watched after that disaster would've probably been better. And yes this is a lot better!I quite liked this season of Avatar. It is certainly a show made for kids. I think my nephews would like this a lot more than I did. Nevertheless, I found it to be an enjoyable adventure story. If you're constantly making notes to all the differences between this and the original whilst watching than I'll do you a solid: do not watch this! This is not a like for like remake of the animation series. My enjoyment comes from me not remembering the original story and seeing this as its own thing. A lot of the actors in this are very young. As with all young actors it's really a hit or miss depending on the scene. Sometimes they nail it sometimes they don't. I do think that a younger audience (that this is clearly aiming for!) are more forgiving of the acting performances than I am.All right so I do have one minor issue. Out of our four main characters (Aang, Katara, Sokka and Zuko) I think Aang drew the short end of the stick. I feel like Katara, Sokka and even Zuko have had more character development than Aang did. I like the stories of Katara and Zuko the best. I don't remember much of the animation series but I do remember that Aang was constantly learning and not just learning the bending of the elements. His story arc has largely stayed the same this season. I think it's great that the side characters are getting good character arcs. But I do hope that Aang's story Arc will be central in next season!","rating":"7\/10","date":"23 February 2024"}
{"title":"Replace all the writers with Aaron Ehasz","review":"I did some digging and went through a list of the staff and credits. A writer for this series released a video on how she entered the screenwriting business. Apparently, she got in there by luck, had been a rom-com and fan fiction enthusiast, and was fixated on female-centric themes, whatever that could mean. In her Q&A she mentions how they pitch ideas in the writing room and try to be yes-men for each other. I can't imagine what else I'll find on the others to see how their hobbies and politics shape the show.The live adaptation, despite similar runtimes, deviates from the creative direction the original series laid out. They cram in cheap scenes between Monk Gyatso and Aang; chop and mix up the reunion sequence with King Bumi and the Gaang; expunge developed habits like Katara's motherly nagging and Sokka's negative thinking; rewrite Azula, the controlling psychopathic princess, as a victim; politicize an ancient Earth Kingdom legend; reveal Ozai's Angels and Fire Lord Ozai himself a bit early; cut out playful scenes like elephant koi and penguin riding; delete subtleties like Katara's necklace affecting Pakku's arc; swap Aang for Sokka in the Cave of Two Lovers dropping the romance; disclose the significance of the comet, etc.There is also too much exposition when they could be dramatizing an emotional scene. Which has more impact? Aang is constantly pulled on the opposite ends of destiny and freedom. He plays with his airball buddies, impressing them with tricks, then he's told, at the age of 12, he's the Avatar, and his friends begin to alienate him for it. The council's prediction of a looming threat, demands of high level training, losing his sense of belonging, and increasing obligations upset him, despite Gyatso's futile pampering, and Aang, scared and confused, flees into a storm. A century later, he makes new friends, astonishes them with his water bending, then suffers Katara's unpleasant question on his identity, and as he looks away he hits us with a painful answer, but is happily embraced because of it. Or Aang talks to himself. This is just one example out of many.By choosing the least creative path, you rob the viewer the chance to think and know, to love and hate, to weep and laugh. A story is always stronger by showing the physical actions and details of your characters. There is no shame in following the superior version; in fact, the adaptation relies on the strength of the original to cut seemingly negligible interactions meant to develop their characters. The animated characters had true undeniable chemistry. We don't witness rapport to that extent in the live-action cast.Aaron Ehasz, the head writer, did an excellent job in tidying up Bryan and Michael's original series. By now it should be clear you need people to shut down bad ideas too and Ehasz was that guy. Anyway, there is a lot to nitpick, like the casting choices, ticks like trembling or licking lips and vocal fry, cosplay tier costumes, etc. But I'd leave that to less busier minds.","rating":"3\/10","date":"23 February 2024"}
{"title":"I seriously don't understand how people can give it higher than a 6\/10","review":"I seriously don't understand how people can give it higher than a 6\/10. I'm only 4 episodes deep myself, but I've already seen such ridiculous storyline changes that I almost don't feel like watching it through.In addition to completely changing the chronological order of very important moments, they are constantly making things up. Copying the characters is very difficult because in the cartoon there are a lot of extreme cartoon-like facial expressions used, but that's exactly why it's so important to recreate the storyline 1 to 1.In short, the series is really made for people who have not seen the cartoon. The visual effects are impressive and the bending of the elements are really good. Unfortunately, this does not outweigh the flaws in the story. Once again, a flop....","rating":"6\/10","date":"23 February 2024"}
{"title":"Not perfect but very close.","review":"This is one of my favorite cartoons. Exciting story line, intriguing character development and so much entertainment.The live action movie was a total flop because you can not cram 61 episodes of content into a 1 hour 43 min movie.The tv series adaptation is way better, but not perfect.The same problem applies. Throughout the cartoon you get so much relationship and character building elements that justifies all the fighting and struggles. Also the audience gets a chance to connect with the characters. So much so that I actually get emotional at moments. That to me shows that this is a great show.Even though they take way more time then a movie and this is 8 episodes for a season, they still have to shorten the story and thereby losing that little bit of magic.That being said. I thoroughly enjoyed watching this and can't wait to see my favorite characters in the next seasons. If Netflix's doesn't finish the story I'll be so disappointed. They made an awesome start with this, I hope they continue.They have a great cast, a good special effects department, a steller story and characters to work with. This should be a great succes. Shows like this can show how important it is for movie and tv show to stick to the source material and do not take creative license to much.","rating":"9\/10","date":"22 February 2024"}
{"title":"No yip yip for this Avatar!","review":"The series failed to capture the internal struggle of Aang as to why he ran away. The series choses to cut the important moments which are monumental in deciding what Aang's willingness to take that important step.Most of the dialogs are forced without any real emotion to back them up. They totally aren't able to recreate the original series funny moments which were a key to their bonding.Moreover, Iroh is one of the strong characters but here fails to make any impression. First time watchers will soon forget him. Deviating too far from the original script is a decision which is back firing this season1.","rating":"6\/10","date":"23 February 2024"}
{"title":"Worth watching","review":"Before going into depths I would like to note that I could imagine how hard it was to work on a story, which was made long ago and has its large fan base. I mean I am a fan, and I think re-watched the animated series 10 or 20 times.In my opinion, the creators managed to let us view the story from new angles without hurting 'fan feelings'. Netflix adaptation looks kinda deeper into the motivation of each character and exposes them more to the audience. I enjoyed the way the authors of the adaption found ways to adapt some events from the original story into the series. It looked seamlessly. Special thanks to the battle scenes with a lot of action and special effects.As for the actors, some of them did not look sincere or experienced and their acting did not touch me. Curiously enough these were the actors playing the 'good guys'. On the other hand, the actors who portrayed key antagonists from the Fire Nation did their job really well. Especially, Dallas Liu who portrayed Prince Zuko, I would like to really thank him for the work he has done while playing this role. His play was balanced, sincere and professional. I would also like to note the depth of some dialogs or monologs especially involving Uncle Iroh, they were deep with a lot of meaning.All in all, as a fan, I should say that this is not that failure movie from 2010. It has disadvantages and advantages compared to the original story, but is definitely worth watching.","rating":"8\/10","date":"27 February 2024"}
{"title":"So much hype throughout the years inevitably leads to disappointment","review":"I'm halfway through the first season, and I've noticed a concerning pace in the storyline. Despite having roughly 400 minutes of runtime across eight episodes, the adaptation feels hurried, missing the depth of its animated predecessor, which had about 460 minutes spread over 20 episodes. Key character-building moments from the original have been omitted, replaced by new plots that, in my opinion, feel unnecessary or prematurely introduce elements from later in the series.So far, Zuko is the only character showing any real development. Despite the introduction of new storylines, the depth of character growth remains lacking. The performances, aside from those of Zuko and Iroh, are disappointing. The cast seems disconnected, as if their participation was reluctant.It's unclear whether the subpar acting stems from a lack of talent, experience, or poor writing. The dialogue comes across as monotonous and awkward, missing the original's playful humor. The decision to alter Sokka's character to fit modern sensibilities was misguided in my view. A few offbeat jokes in a fantasy series aren't reflective of the creators' views on social issues - changing this was unnecessary and led to diluted character interactions filled with bland, generic dialogue. I believe even an AI like ChatGPT could have crafted more authentic scripts, especially by preserving key conversations from the original.On a positive note, the visual effects surpassed my expectations. The team managed to convincingly recreate the bending techniques within a reasonable budget, a commendable feat for a live-action adaptation.Despite my criticisms, I've rated the series a 7 out of 10. I believe it could captivate new viewers or those who haven't seen the original series in years. The world of Avatar remains enthralling, with its rich lore likely to engage fans old and new. For me, however, having recently revisited the original series (few weeks ago), this adaptation falls short of recapturing the magic that made the original so memorable. I hope that the rest of the season proves me wrong.","rating":"7\/10","date":"23 February 2024"}
{"title":"Time to Give a chance","review":"After watching the whole season I can safely say this adaptation was excellent!!! I can see fans of the series being disappointed in some alternate plot details but I believe it's time to see the bigger picture. It's time for the avatar legend to continue and the live action can do that. It can create and tell new stories even after the end of the original, and even though some plots were slightly changed, I dare say it was for the better. I've watched both the original and the live action and as a fan of the original I can say that some plot details were depicted clearer and even more descriptively than the original. However it's time to let comparisons go, it's time to see the avatar world rise once more because if it does not, we might not be ever able to witness the continuation of this story.","rating":"9\/10","date":"23 February 2024"}
{"title":"Shallow but very pretty","review":"As a fan of the original I decided to give this a fair shot. Watch it with fresh eyes so to speak. So going from there I will start with the bad - the pacing is a bit weird (very fast) and consequently skips over character development moments, especially \"in action\". They talk a lot about what they're thinking and it doesn't come off natural. Simply - the dialogue could be a lot better. And the casting doesn't help. I like a few actors (disregarding how close they actually come to the original char), specifically Sokka, Ozai (probably the best) and a few \"supporting\" chars that are not present that often. The rest I can only describe as beginner actors. Especially Katara and uncle Iroh. Aang.. is also not the best but not as bad.Now the neutral - I'm not mad how they restructured the plot, that's fine as it is an adaptation. Very little humor involved, but it is there sometimes. Mentioning Azula here would be fitting - she's alright. But really Zuko and Azula look like little children to me which seems wrong. One more thing I cannot clear from my biased mind is Mai... She was such a badass skinny goth and they cast her as a slightly chubby yes girl. But I put those things in neutral because it's just my bias to the original. I could list a lot here but it's not productive. The original chars are just not what you can expect here at all.The good - the visuals. God they crafted a wonderful world. The environment, the CGI, fights - it is just amazing. I am truly amazed at this part and I honestly thought this would be the bad part, but it was actually flipped. I imagined the acting and dialogue would be HEAPS better and the world toned down but nooope. Everything went into the visuals.","rating":"6\/10","date":"5 March 2024"}
{"title":"DON'T LISTEN TO BAD REVIEWS AND GIVE IT A TRY","review":"For anyone complains about the rush story, you have to consider the fact that these cast AGE! Esp kids, they'll grow up really fast and don't have enough time to follow the original episode by episode, so I understand why they have to cut off parts.The acting is decent to me, natural, not over-acting or something, tho I admit there are some quite cringey scenes (especially romantic ones). Aang is perfectly casted, his smile is vibrant, truly Aang's nature. CGI's good enough. And I agree the story could have written better. But I can see the potential and this series is really worth trying! I'm an Avatar fan myself and I'm so looking forward to the next season.","rating":"9\/10","date":"25 February 2024"}

I was quite excited about this one but when it came somehow I couldn't find the connection.... No wonder studio made the VFX awesome (Kudos to the team) but rest is not at all satisfactory!! Maybe because I've seen the original series many times. Specially mixing and and reforming the original story line wasn't done properly.....\nTop of that I personally not ok with the cast.

{"title":"This Ain't It, Netflix","review":"Pros:It looks good. The costumes are pretty well designed with lovely details and a certain authenticity to them. The special effects have their moments of lesser quality, but for the most part they're quite impressive.It reminded me why I love the cartoon so much.Cons:Where to start?Much of the acting is, well, questionable. It strikes me as a directorial problem, as even some of the seasoned actors are awkward and stiff. But give poor direction to kids and you get 'emotional' scenes that you just have to wince your way through.The structure of the narrative has been chopped to pieces and shuffled around like a deck of cards. Parts of the plot from the middle of the original book 1 are dragged to the beginning. Even more egregious are the elements from book 2- and some as far as book 3- that find themselves being crow barred into the already shortened plot, resulting in a very rushed pacing that barely has room to draw breath. This also robs large parts of the unfolding story of their mystery and impact.The character arcs are vague at best and absent at worst. Unfortunately, that includes Aang. The innocent, carefree, playful, and jovial boy in the iceberg is not here. Nor are the layers of his fear, trepidation, guilt, and grief.Whether by necessity of the speedy pace or simply a lack of care, the writing leaves much to be desired. It leans very heavily on the \"tell\" half of \"show don't tell\", with swathes of dialogue that in the original was used for character moments and humour, now dedicated to exposition dumps.The cliff notes feel of the series, combined with a certain lack of polish and attention to detail, somewhat suggests that the creators didn't really understand what made the cartoon so great. It's missing those subtleties that added so much to the breadth of the world, and makes re-watching such a treat when you notice the fragments of foreshadowing you missed last time. Rather than letting the story and stakes rise and expand naturally, it ticks off plot points like a checklist before quickly moving on.I'm quite disappointed. It's a hollow but nice to look at shell of the cartoon, which I shall be watching again instead of this.","rating":"4\/10","date":"23 February 2024"}
{"title":"Not bad not good","review":"As far as I can remember, Katara needed a teacher and the people of a city or a country knew thier. Princess. To be honest, the third episode destroyed everything I wanted to see in the series, the characters officially changed,but the fights specialy in Kiyoshi Sequence are great and the acting I'm not an actor but i can get it when a actor is not good Aang and Katara could be much more real in acting performance,There were several sequences that were not in the anime and were in the series, which were strangely perfect for me, you know it's good but not someone who's been watching the anime for entire of his life.","rating":"6\/10","date":"25 February 2024"}
{"title":"the changes are justified but some kid actors need acting lessons before S2","review":"Overall, I'd say the changes were justified in order to produce a fast-paced plot that would give twitchy Netflix subscribers no excuse to click away due to boredom. Maybe the writers were a bit too paranoid about it, but it did hit #1 in almost every country Netflix serves, so they got what they wanted, and no doubt there will be a season two, where hopefully they can slow down, let the story breathe, let the kids goof around, and generally stop being so panic-stricken.Before then, the kids playing Aang, Katara and Azula need some acting lessons, and the writers need to sharpen up the writing for Azula so she is more convincing as a strategic genius who Daddy thinks could be a worthy successor, and who could lead a conquering army. So far, she comes off as a little brat. But they can turn that around in season 2.Favorite characters: Sokka, Zuko and of course the Cabbage Merchant. Looking forward to the next season.","rating":"8\/10","date":"2 March 2024"}
{"title":"Lacking some of the most important things.","review":"Excellent bending and CGI, some good fight scenes, some good moments from the actors. A few changes for the better. Gyatsu was so good that I cried during the first ep. Unfortunately Iroh, such an important character, didn't have the same energy as the original. I can't even talk about Bumi's personality. Several character arcs lost their essence, including Aang and Katara. Unnecessary narration, several unnecessary speeches. Some confusing and chaotic episodes. Many lines completely opposite to the character's personality. Calm moments are missing. Dallas Liu (Zuko) carries the series almost single-handedly, I have that to be grateful for.","rating":"6\/10","date":"23 February 2024"}

Acting is very poor unfortunate.#. The heart of story and characters that were created seemed to be missing.#. Camera works are just bad especially in action parts and often when bending unfortunate, this lead for me anyway especially in action parts hard to see what happening because shaky, jumpy & too fast moving from place to place so dizzying and unable see what happening. Even weirdly just for walking at times.#. Because parts changed and some left in didn't make sense with changes made just seemed odd.#. Some lines they said kinda made me cringe.#.

{"title":"Entertaining, but Lacking Beloved Elements of the Original.","review":"Visuals - 9\/10The visual effects and production values are spectacular. From the locations to costumes and makeup to bending and martial arts, everything looks incredible. I am removing a point for Princess Yue's garish wig and makeup, which makes her look like the Princess Yue from the Ember Island play .Casting - 7\/10Some of the casting is perfection - Kiawentiio as Katara, Ian Ousley as Sokka, Daniel Dae Kim as Fire Lord Ozai, Maria Zhang as Suki, Gordon Cormier as Aang himself are the highlights. Katara and Sokka look eerily similar to their cartoon counterparts, which is no easy feat. Danny Pudi makes a great cameo.Paul Sun-Hyung Lee as General Iroh is also a great choice, but IMO he should have made an effort to evoke Mako's iconic vocal performance.But some of the other cast members are a let down. Zuko, Azula, Mai in particular. I can't fault their acting, but they look very different from the originals, which stands out given how well the show has otherwise done to pick actors that look the part. Biggest let down was Zhao, who neither has the look or the strength or charisma of the original.Humor - 2\/10Humor was a major and much loved part of the original. Lot of that humor is lost in translation to the new medium. I understand it is difficult to replicate cartoon humor in live action, but the writers could have still tried to make it as funny in the way live action comedy can be funny.Faithfulness to the Original - 6\/10Adapting a children's cartoon (especially an eternal classic beloved by kids and adults alike) to live action for a more diverse global audience is a challenging act, which is why most anime adaptations fail. Changes are unavoidable.Some of the changes are good. As a fan of Avatar Kiyoshi, it was great to see her in action even it meant the Avatar getting a new ability. The darker events that the original avoided for the sake of its young audience, are portrayed vividly in this one. The opening with the events at the beginning of the war and the annihilation of the Air Nomads does a great job of introducing the villainy of the Fire Nation and the harsh reality of a world at war.But other changes are not so sensible. I have already mentioned the lack of humor. Along with the humor many other little details of the story are streamlined or removed altogether (for instance, the events of the Northern Air Temple are moved to Omashu) despite the overall runtime of this first season being close to that of the original's. Instead we have an unnecessary subplot involving the early introduction of Azula and her cohort. They should saved on the salaries of those cast members and the extra runtime, and used it for some of those missing elements.Conclusion - 7\/10While it is not nearly as good as it could have been, it is still a huge improvement on the previous live action adaption. It is entertaining in its own right, and I would happily watch two more seasons. So Netflix please don't cancel it. Take the criticism which this is inevitably going to get from fans and posers alike, and make it better next season. Flamio!","rating":"7\/10","date":"22 February 2024"}
{"title":"Keep an open mind and enjoy it!","review":"I like the live action. I believe every media has its own way of telling a story. Don't expect an animated project or a live action or a comic art or literature to tell a story the same way. Keep an open mind.The best thing this live action did was showing us the details that we didn't see in the animated series like the Airbenders genocide, Azula's arc becoming a perfectionist, the roots behind Sokka's issues with his dad and why he really wants to prove to him that he's a great warrior, and what happened to the solders who Fire Lord Ozai wanted to sacrifice and Zuko stood up for and had a dule with with his Father. The lives action tried to not repeate the original material but it stayed faithful to it by showing parts of the picture that we couldn't see and told the story in a way that's straight to the point and suitable for a live action.I like how the show handled the issue of the Northen water tribe regarding women not being allowed to fight. It ended by all women in the tribe standing up against Paku talking sense to him and the new generation of male water benders admiring katara's fighting.Not her fighting him then he finds out that she is his ex's granddaughter then she gets a pass! I wanted to know how later the women in the northen tribe became allowed to fight because we saw in the legend of Korra her cousin Eska was allowed to fight. I just assumed that there's a time after the war Katara changed the mind of the rest of the tribe because it seemed that only Katara got a pass.The point is things can be told differently and this depends of on the medium and budget and all those factors affect how a story should be told. You can't have fillers and extra side stories in a live action specially if it's ment to be short. This one is an adaptation. They tried to take the best elements of each episode and combined them into one story arc.If you want something exactly similar to the source material, just go and rematch the animated series period.","rating":"8\/10","date":"23 February 2024"}
{"title":"It tried","review":"It was better than the movie at least. Sokka and Iroh were well cast but really felt let down by katara, Azula and even Ang a bit. The show just didn't make the characters as emotionally dynamic as the animated version. They felt so much more ridged.Also the acting for the most part was just lacking. Hair\/makeup and costume needed some work too. With a show like this you just have to accept that to make it really work, you have to throw real money at the production and you can tell they just didn't invest at that level.Can't help but think of the original show creators had stayed on with this show, their vision would have been better. I have hope for the animated show.","rating":"6\/10","date":"24 February 2024"}
{"title":"Worth watching because you love the Avatar world And learning more about it","review":"I am a huge fan of the original animated series. I've seen it about 15-20 times. I always learn something new every time I watch it.This live action was brilliant in its own way. It stuck close to the original but also had creative freedom to dive deeper into the characters which I really appreciated and change the story slightly to make it flow better for an older audience. There were a bunch of things different from the animated vision that took me a second to get over and once I did I really enjoyed it and it kept me on my toes.I can completely understand why every episode wasn't verbatim because A) that would be boring as heck B) it'll be way too costly and C) it wouldn't work in live action. With that being said, I did miss the comedic parts from Sokka or how much of a child Aang is like when he wanted to ride the penguin seals and the Unagi. I also missed Uncle Iroh carefree tea-drinking attitude towards life. I also had to remember that the animated series was made for children and not adults. Whereas I believe this live action was more created for the people that grew up watching the original and wanted something more sophisticated. As for the love at first sight with Aang to Katara, it worked in the animated series but in alive action in 2024 a child liking an older girl and them falling in love would be weird. I think the writers felt the same.Zuko is one of my favourites and I liked how they dove more deeply into his character and his past. It gave him even more depth to what I already know about him. It was awesome to watch him become angry due to home circumstances. It was also wonderful to see how and why Uncle Iroh joined him looking for the Avatar. Adding the story about the 41st was an amazing addition. It wasn't just Zuko and Uncle Iroh that they added some tasty tidbits into their back story they actually did that with a lot of the characters. It added to the story, an unexpected bonus. I was also pleased that all the big parts that need to be there were there more or less.I also found the special effects really good while keeping that animated-ish essence. The world building was epic and the bending was top notch. Did you see the ostrich horses? So cool.What I found awesome was it was filmed in Vancouver Canada. Some of the actors like Gordon Cormier (Aang) Kiawentiio (Katara) and Paul Sun-Hyung Lee (Uncle Iroh) all great Canadian actors among other Canadians that had rolls along the way. Also, shout out to Tamlyn Tomita (Yukari). She was in The Karate Kid Part II (1986) as Kumiko. Great to see her.I believe the folks that didn't like this wanted it to be verbatim of the original or remember the other live action movie from 2010 as being crap, and it was. They already had an idea of what they wanted from it. Their expectations were doomed to let them down so, they hated it and gave it a poor rating and review. I'm not sure why any one would want to watch a remake carbon copy. How boring would that be? Go watch the original if that's what you're looking for.Is it different? In some parts, yes!Was it entertaining? Heck yes!Did it have the same essence of the OG? It sure did.I highly recommend watching this with an open mind and invite the differences as part of the Avatar: The Last Airbender world in, not because you want to hate on it but because you love that world. You'll gain some more insight into each character.I'm really looking forward to seeing how they adapt and meet new characters like Toph, Combustion Man or Hama. I can't wait to see Ba Sing Se and the Western Air Temple. Just like Pakku said to Katara: Change is good!! I can't wait to see what other things they add to build on each character as well.Bring on season 2!!","rating":"8\/10","date":"27 February 2024"}
{"title":"My summary","review":"They put Roku as a clown, Katara learned very quickly, Aang is irritating, he spends the entire series in a melodramatic way, I understand the first 4 chapters but the 8 chaptersI loved the development of the characters except Aang, Zuko God, I liked how they put together the story, the visual effects were god (sometimes not), the consequences of the 100 years war are better developed than in the comics but it bothers me that in almost every episode they repeat it to me, I I would have liked them not to repeat it so much, sometimes it seems that everything happens very quickly but in general for me Netflix broke with that live action despite the things that I didn't like, I mean, I was hooked from beginning to end.","rating":"6\/10","date":"24 February 2024"}
{"title":"10\/10 for the trailer team, every else only gets the participation trophy","review":"I got to admit, I did get excited after watching the trailers, so whoever put them together, absolutely great job. Everyone else disappointed me and all fans of the original show.Both Shyamalan and the writers for this newest adaptation have failed to realize what made ATLA special, i.e. The writing and atmosphere.Writing as in story, character development arcs, the little bits and bobs that brought them togheter, the pacing, the dialogue, the contrast between Aang's innocence and his actual duty, so many other things that will make this review a small book... The jist of it is, the writers spun the story and events to appeal to modern audiences and I feel that either they're extremely smart and think the entire population of the earth is intellectually challenged or they are part of the 2nd category themselves.Writers today heavily underestimate the viewers and their capabilities of following a story or they can't do it themselves and use exposition dumps just to make sure they never have to write something more complex, of which I remind you, they already had the material. They could've copy + paste the entire story and they would've been acclaimed as geniuses, but unfortunately, they did not... Extremely lazy writing and interpretation.In the atmosphere department, I will fully admit they did justice to the visuals, everything looks stunning and perfectly translated from the animation. What they screw up though is, again, the child-like freedom of the story. And the worst offensive is the generic from the shelf background music, used in almost every single scene, because apparently they didn't trust the kid actors to do their job ( and they were right unfortunately ) and needed further emphasis on what the viewers are supposed to feel at any given moment.Again, I can go into further detail, but this is already longer than it should've been. I wanted to keep it short, say how amazing it was and urge everyone to give it a go, but life is often disappointing.I'm only going to lightly spoil the first episode, but keep in mind that there are reccuring issues.They changed events that are iconic to the series. The \"come closer... Wanna come penguin sledding with me ??\" is gone. Gran gran became the exposition dump bender, far worse than in the series. Katara suddenly learns to waterbend way beyond what she w9as able to in basically 1 short scene. Furthermore, instead of the deck fight with Zuko where she freezes the soldiers ( the fight is again, iconic ) she is the one that stops Zuko's fireball aimed at them. Because she's not enough of a badass by the end of the series, she needs to be a girl boss right from the get go.Why show of how powerful Aang is, which is something she constantly acknowledges over the series until she also gains incredible power by struggling enduring and constantly improving, when she can learn starting in the first 30 mins of the show ? Why let the male actor have the initial glory ?Not to mention her motherly personality is a thing of the past...Look... You can watch it, it's.... decent. For some people distracted by pretty lights it can also be a 10\/10 since I fully admited it does look stunning.But, if you are a fan of the original or you don't like being talked down to, you'll not enjoy it. You are STILL better off watching the \"kids\" show, and that's just sad in my opinion. They had ample time to not screw it up and the absolute perfect material, and yet, unfortunately, they did...I tried, I really did. Too many things were changed and not in a good way. I truly believe the entertainment industry thinks of us as chickens, with similar attention spans. And I am so tired of it.Good luck to the newer generations...","rating":"3\/10","date":"22 February 2024"}
{"title":"Movie was much better.","review":"Expectation really do hurt. The Graphics were well put but the storyline and characters didn't suit well. Zuko and his sister acting are worst. Avatar could have shown more strength to his emotions. Sokka acting was too dull. I felt like I was watching a series with less purpose to dive in deep. I usually finish any series if I find it appealing and upto the story but this whole series I watch was rather like coping mechanism for me. Just for the sake. I hope the writers who are planning to write the story and work on the new season should really work hard on the storyline and especially the character which need to deem fit( ownership of character in the series needs to be reconsidered hard).","rating":"6\/10","date":"23 February 2024"}
{"title":"Let's see what unfolds next","review":"I gotta hand it to the crew that made this whole production, they did a helluva good job with ATLA, sure a lot of scenes were skipped, key scenarios and characters were combined in certain and very interesting ways, character dynamics changed, but I love the more mature approach to this. Showing that being the avatar is not all fun and games and antics, it's also not about facing dangers alone. The bending in this is a thousand times better than what Shyamalon did, at least these people kept the bending art, even make it a little more realistic with movements. I can't wait to see what more adventures await the series, what Togh will be like, Ba Sing Sa, metal bending, Zuko teaming up with Team Avatar.","rating":"9\/10","date":"24 February 2024"}
{"title":"Hoping for the next season","review":"The Avatar (The Last Airbender) series tells the story of a young boy named Avatar who must master four elemental powers in order to rescue the planet and defeat an enemy. I didn't know about Avatar before, but after watching it, it has quickly become one of my favorite series. I can't wait for the next season, so I'm going to watch a cartoon series instead.First of all, they did a wonderful job when compared to the previous Airbender film (2010). The show looks fantastic, with good plot, sets, and colors. The young actor who plays Zuko does an outstanding job. The action moments are spectacular in terms of battle choreography. The visuals are fantastic with Bending techniques, the way the elements link with the body of the characters, and the locations are all beautiful. They bring the world to life. However, that is not what Avatar is about. The live series missed significant character development aspects because there were too many plot points and characters to squeeze into fewer episodes. Above all, Aang's story revealed nothing special about him. If I changed perspectives and made Zuko the main character, the entire situation would change. And the story would become more interesting to watch. About the character's role and appearance, I'm annoyed by the Sokka character. I don't understand how Sokka was able to kiss two girls in such a short period of time. It doesn't make any sense to me. Moreover, Princess Yue reminds me of my grandmother. She has white hair, which does not suit her age of 16 years old, and she has tied her hair up, which makes her look much older than she is, which bothers me a lot.To conclude, for those who have not seen the original, I believe this series is worth viewing, but it should do better in the future. I'm hoping they have a larger budget from Netflix for season two, which will allow them to stay truer to the script.","rating":"7\/10","date":"3 March 2024"}
{"title":"Visually strong, weak script","review":"I feel like they had everything going for them, the set design, production, visual effects, even really good actors !! But the script and plotline fell flat. The actors are all pretty young and new to the limelight, and it was hard to see their potential but watch it go to waste with the awkward and almost forced words. The writers need to learn subtlety - well know its better to show than tell.I also don't understand why they need to make Netflix shows so short. It really is hard to condense the entire world of Avatar into 8 episodes, and I feel like fans will actually appreciate it more if they took the time needed to properly tell the story. Not even at least 10 episodes would've been ok? You can clearly see the writers struggle with this short timeline as seen by the rewritten plotlines that didn't mesh so well together in the end.Still halfway through and it seems like it's getting better. I'm hoping if there's a second season that they make major improvements.","rating":"7\/10","date":"27 February 2024"}
{"title":"Surprisingly good. Far from perfect but not completely bad","review":"The acting especially for the actors of Aang and Katara needs a lot of improvement. I'm impressed by the performance of Ian and Dallas portraying their respective characters. A lot of you may disagree with me but I'm liking Elizabeth Yu's performance as Azula, they were probably setting her character up and how she turns out to be a cold-hearted, manipulative person we all know. I'm kinda having a problem on how they portray Bumi here because in the OG series he is funny and sarcastic but intelligent and gives good advices to Aang at the same time and that's what make him a very unique character.The bending is also surprisingly wonderful. The movements are close to accurate from the OG series. They need a lot of improvement and problems to fix so they can give us a much more better season 2&3.","rating":"9\/10","date":"15 April 2024"}
{"title":"Replace them or get them in some acting classes","review":"The actors who play Aang, Katara, and Azula need to be replaced. None of them capture their characters. I did not believe any of them and their performances fell flat. No emotional intensity, believability, or anything which caused the character's stories to not be properly conveyed. It seemed like the ones who played Aang and Katara were reading off the script and grasping in the wind for the point. Parts where they were supposed to be sad, angry, or excited were subpar. And the one who plays Azula is hardly vicious enough for that role. The character in the cartoon version was ruthless and I didn't get that in her performance. The most I get is spoiled, pissed off brat. And that was not Azula's character. But otherwise, everyone else was great. Awesome special effects but I'm kinda disappointed the story really never went anywhere. Aang didn't learn any other disciplines or anything... Yet they skipped to parts of the story where he'd already been progressing. I will watch season 2, but they need to get it together. New Aang, Katara, and Azula.","rating":"6\/10","date":"2 March 2024"}
{"title":"Gets trashed too easily","review":"I loved the original cartoon. It was full of great lessons about strength, compassion, character and integrity. The goofy and silly side of the original cartoon is not entirely lost on this show, as many say.Aang gets to goof around a bit and the casting was fairly well done. Initially, it feels jarring to see them IRL, but once you get used to it, you really do get into it more.Why it doesn't get a 10 from me, like the original, is that it lacks more comedic moments. Momo and Aang provide some comic relief, but it's not as much as I would have liked.The replacement of Roku by Avatar Kioshi was not cool, imo. I understand why they did it, but she was a total ***** to him the second she met him and I feel like that was completely and totally unwarranted. Roku never dealt with him in such a harsh way and also manifested at the fire temple.The most of the changes they made make sense to me, because you're trying tot turn a MASSIVE show into a miniseries by comparison. You can't just cut things together - there has to be reason and I think that's why the show sometimes leans so hard on the emotions.Still watching and I'm really looking forward to Toph, so we'll see. Tbh, I think Netflix did a great job on everything.","rating":"8\/10","date":"2 March 2024"}
{"title":"I liked it, but I see why the original creators exited the project.","review":"Honestly, it was better than I thought it would be. In comparison to the 2010 live action take, this adaption at least adheres far closer to the source material while taking the obvious creative liberties.ProsDallas Liu's portrayal of Prince Zuko is spot on. A stand out performance for sure. In fact, I like everything the creators of the live action did with Zuko. They hit the mark every time with this guy.Joining Dallas Liu in character portrayal and delivery is Ian Ousley, who delivers a pretty good portrayal of Sakka's dry wit humor. Imo, I feel that Sakka is by far the trickiest character to really nail down in a live action adaption. He's largely comedic relief but then he illustrates spurts of brilliance and seriousness here and there. I feel like Ian did an excellent job navigating the nuances of Sakka's character for the most part.The Bending is fantastic and the fight choreography is pretty good.The dynamic between Fire Lord Ozai, Azula, Iroh and Zuko was very well done.ConsI found the depth between Team Avatar lacking. The actors who play Aang, Katara and Sakka don't have any on screen chemistry, no emotional depth. They feel more like stage actors reading lines at each other than actors owning their characters respected roles.Oddly enough, Aang and Katara don't have any on screen presence compared to their animated counterparts. Katara's personality is like she's an NPC. She doesn't have any real agency and she feels largely like a background character in her own story. Aang is no different. In this adaptation he doesn't FEEL like the main character and again, his character lacks agency.Prophetic dreams drive the plot. For some reason Aang's journey is propelled by a random dream sequence of the Fire Nation attacking the Northern Water Tribe... but in the animation, it was a rather very simple reason that triggered Aang, Katara and Sakka to journey up north and that was to find a waterbending master for the BOTH of them to learn from. That's it. That's what started it all. I get for the TV adaption, there is a need to create tension by illustrating certain doom, but this is also a lazy approach. The original animation already laid a simple groundwork that could have easily been lifted into the live action without the need of dream sequences to do most of the legwork.","rating":"7\/10","date":"3 March 2024"}
{"title":"I tried \u00f0\u0178\u02dc\u00ad","review":"Maybe it's because I just finished the animated series which I truly love rewatching, up there with my Justice League animated collection.While the visuals were powerful and impressive, the story telling feels rushed and dialogue feels really forced, esp when trying to fit in the catch phrases from the animated version. I can see why the original creators left the show due to creative differences.The casting was good though, Zuko is especially spot on and his acting lifts up the show properlyThat said, if you haven't watched the animated series, and are new to ATLA, then this show will be exciting to watch.","rating":"4\/10","date":"22 February 2024"}
{"title":"Trust Your Source Material","review":"I love ATLA (animated version), which means it is almost impossible to give this version a fair and balanced review. So this review is why I think this version does not measure up to the animated version. It is not a \"standalone\" review of this version.There are two key issues; a lack of confidence in the source material and interruption to suspension of disbelief.In regards to the first, each episode of the animated version is 22 mins long and each season is 20 episodes long (except Book 3) - approximately 6.6 hours , the Netflix version is 8 hours long. This would indicate an opportunity to get to know characters, build character arcs and build tension toward a climax - even more so than the animated version. But that is not what you get in the first season; you get additional characters (three past avatars, Ozai, Azula and her entourage). You get reveals from Book 2 & 3 from the animated version (the air ship) and additional plot lines (Ozai using Zuko to make \"Azula\" better).All of this creates 8 hours of \"what's this, what's next\", when it could have been \"wow, more depth\". The space that would have been allowed for character development is now gone, actions taken to create tension and huge emotional pay offs are now gone. I will give two examples; Ang does not bend water at all in the Netflix version, he also does not have the run in with Jun Jun that leads to him swearing to never fire bend again - this means through Book 1 he is not working on his plan to master all 4 elements to beat Soizon's comet, he is not learning fire bending at all and it makes his final decision to learn from Zuko so much more impactful. The second example is the introduction of Azula and making it seem she is evil because Ozia is making her evil - this means that in Season 1 we have three villains (Ozai, Azula and Jhao) to get to know, it diminishes the \"strength\" of Azula's character and how high she is regarded by Ozai, it also confuses the fact that Zuko's character is derived from Roku and Azula's from Azulon (Good vs Evil) so the final fight between Azula and Zuko is no longer so \"deep rooted\" in their characters in Book 3. As a side note: why does Sokka kiss Suki and Yue this season, now what happens in Book 3 with Suki?! I could also use a similar argument for Jhao and Iro - giving away plot points that build up to climaxes when they could be adding more history to the characters.The second point about suspension of disbelief is secondary to the first but important. ATLA is set in a fantasy universe; to have characters speak in plain American accents and too often resort to sarcasm hurts the viewing immersion in the show, this is especially the case when little character development time is given. I am specifically thinking about Iro & Jhao. I think that anything you can do to keep people \"in\" the fantasy world needs to be done; Iro's accent and style of talking is particularly jarring - he does not sound old, wise, war wary for 95% of the time. Jhao is sarcastic, portrayed as a inept and conniving - not the aggressive, rash but rising officer (which once again makes his demise less fulfilling). Finally by introducing so many characters so early there is no opportunity to create anticipation, and meet it, to further increase suspension of disbelief when the characters are talking.The rating given is for a standalone viewing, but when compared to ATLA this is a 4. The thing that made animated ALTA so good was the immense emotional, character, plot and action climax at the end of Book 3. That is what takes a children's story set in a fantasy universe to a whole new level. By the decisions taken in Season 1 they have significantly hurt the depth of the climax. In summary this story is about Aang & Zuko, not everyone else.Aesthetically; Zuko's scar is not \"severe enough\", where is Azula's blue bending (it is central to her character), Coe could have been so much better, Badgermoles bend not dig and Sokka's boomerang does not come back!Some positive items; Sokka is quite good, the Kyoshi warriors are good, Suki is good, Zuko is good, Aang is ok (finding a kid that can bend and act must be hard) and Boomi is good,","rating":"6\/10","date":"3 March 2024"}
{"title":"A (slightly) different take, but a welcome one","review":"To sum it up: GOOD: music, VFX, antagonist, character chemistry, world building. BAD: rushed story, earthbenders, some modern language.In the last 16 years, I've watched the original animated show about 4 times. I even gave it 10 stars here on IMDB many years ago. I don't call myself a fan, but I do love the original show.After the first season of this live-action show, I like what they did with the known elements of the Avatar world (pun intended), since I wasn't expecting an exact copy of the original, nor I wanted one. I believe this new product can be enjoyed separately, considering how complex and expensive a live-action can get, compared to an animated show.VFX was mostly superb, and few times was a bit lacking. Nature elements VFX can be resource-consuming, and although there's room for improvement, it's mostly well integrated to character's movements and other scenes. Landscapes were amazing in most cases. Sound effects and music felt quite accurate for the show.As for the characters, we will have to wait if audiences who didn't watch the show can keep up with all of them. They are a lot for an 8-episode first season, knowing that most of them should appear in the next seasons. Also, if this show keeps going, might be a good idea to make a movie for the final event.Character's chemistry was good, but could be better if it weren't rushed, which affected character development and relationships. It's a bit distracting the use of some modern language expresions, considering the epic and ancient tone the Avatar world has.While action scenes and fight choreographies were good (not much shaky camera, fortunately), martial arts movements related to element bending were a bit repetitive, and specially some secondary earthbenders' movements, were not solid nor tough (next season should do some justice to that and I'm looking forward how the will portray one specific earthbender). That being said, the personality of firebenders and earthbenders was intimidating and ruthless many times, which I appreciate they showed it. And the additional insight about airbenders was beautifully done.I enjoyed this show a lot, and I sincerely hope they continue and finish the story. Go Team Avatar!","rating":"8\/10","date":"24 February 2024"}
{"title":"Engrossing, but very flawed","review":"I have to confess that I am totally unfamiliar with the anime which is the source of this series and so I cannot comment on how faithful this adaption is to its origin. I recognise that for many watchers, the faithfulness of this adaption to its source is going to make a big impact on how they rate it. I can only comment on how enjoyable this is as a stand alone series. To be honest, I really did enjoy this series. The story is strong enough, the effects and the sets are good enough to keep the viewers attention and even to binge watch. The only down side I can see - and it's a big one - is that the acting throughout is awful. The cast seems to have been chosen based on how oriental they look, not on how well they act. It's hard to find a single cast member whose acting talents are even average. The young lad who plays Aang is one of the worst. Half the time, he speaks so quickly it's impossible to understand what he is saying. Thank goodness for subtitles. I don't know if the original anime was Chinese or Japanese (or otherwise Asian) in origin, but this series is pure Hollywood and America. That's definitely not to its benefit.In short, I enjoyed this but it is seriously flawed.","rating":"7\/10","date":"26 February 2024"}
{"title":"Better by far than 2010 predecessor .","review":"The best live action version to date. Although some changes to the storyline are made, none change the general story of the original series. The actor for Aang does a great job. Sokka is spot on. Katara is far better. All in all, a good 1st season. I suspect as the other seasons come out, it will do nothing but improve as the writers and actors settle into the roles and the story progresses. As with any new series, the first season can feel shaky at times. If memory serves me right, the origional animated series was stronger during seasons two and three. All in all, what I have seen so far keeps with the origional story and character building. I recommend watching this one.","rating":"8\/10","date":"24 February 2024"}
{"title":"I hope they grow","review":"This is a show that I think will work better for people who haven't seen the original show, however even from a writing standpoint, the narrative, direction and dialogue lack in a lot of areas.What the show does right is the world-building, casting, costume and action. It felt very faithful to the story in that sense. There were even a few moments that were quite touching. I simply wish they took more time in the other areas.The first half was perhaps the hardest to deal with in those areas as it felt like the writers simply added the exposition from the storyboard directly into the spoken dialogue of the characters rather than let the story and actions - or even inactions - tell the exposition. It felt entirely out of place in what I assume was to info dump to fit it in to the 1-hour blocks of eight-episodes they had while the original series' first season had 21 minutes for 20 episodes; there was a lot of dialogue that could've been cut or edited down.Other issues I had were in regards to direction: Sokka and Suki's story felt wrong in the way Suki was originally presented in her debut episode was not presented here, as was how they portrayed Boomy; more so even for Boomy. I don't know what they were thinking with his character. While the ending was somewhat similar, the journey there felt mean to the character.All in all, I hope the show gets picked up as the last few episodes they seems to find something of a balance, although maybe it was masked by the overall events of the first season coming to a close. I hope that's not the case. I hope they learn from this season and come back stronger in the second.","rating":"7\/10","date":"26 February 2024"}

And ask you, how many opportunities do you see a diverse cast ABCENT of leading white character(s) or a single white \"hero\" that saves a BIPoC cast... in original English language?SCRIPT\nThey largely maintain the course of events well and even with the blending of arcs, they overlap and weave together without feeling crunched. I do however acknowledge they unnecessarily messed with Koh (the face stealer), though; but not enough to compromise the integrity of the production.ART & VX\nThe costuming, colour timing, and editing are tight, and unrushed.The bending... omg the bending. The care they took to create a realistic effect is SO MUCH subtler than what people appreciate. (I used to work in film) they are using a combination of digital and practical effects which results in movement that seemingly obeys physics. There's weight, and resistance to create the effect the bender essentially commands the element move in a manner within those properties. EXCELLENT!LIVE ACTION vs ANIMATION\nThe motion and dialogue have translated well. It's difficult to find the right timing with humour. I think Sokka could have been a little punchier, but his sardonic wit is there, and I hope we see it expand as the character gains confidence with his place on the team.THEMATIC INCLUSION\nAnd now something I didn't expect, but it greatly suits the attenuated maturity of live action and not something that could be highlighted in an age 8+ animated show. THAT IS THE INCLUSION of war trauma and its impact on society, its people and how... generational it is.The particular moment with Iroh, comes to mind, but there are many to choose from. Regardless of how much we love Iroh, and regardless of his desire to seek redemption and balance-and later his allyship with the Avatar, he was in fact a war criminal. He acted on the behest of an Imperialist conquest. His actions brought of pain and a generation of trauma-even to himself. Looking someone in the eye about that was... well, it was complex. And I appreciated the show not letting him off lightly about it, and also weaving in the consequences of war-its impact, in other places in the show. Shown in this manner, it is UNIQUE to the live action.CONCLUSION\nAll in all, I think this is a great live action adaptation. It feels like there was great effort and consideration in the making of this show. I can appreciate it for its own unique merits without abandoning the intensions of its source work.7.5 - 8\/10.","rating":"8\/10","date":"1 March 2024"}
{"title":"Movie wasn't that bad, serie is not that good","review":"A serie has more opportunity to give depth to the characters and stay truer to the book(s) or in this case the animated tv show, than a movie. Somehow this serie is not as good as how bad the movie was. They're closer in rating than currently depicted by Imdb. Imho.Another review here mentions the abominable level of acting. I agree the casting could have been better on some of the characters, but it's too easy to blame the young actors. It's a sum of things. Some of the acting, the obvious fake moustache, the bad cgi parts, the weak dialogues.My conclusion of the serie is that I'd rather rewatch the movie than the serie. Equally pleasurable, less time-consuming.","rating":"6\/10","date":"22 February 2024"}
{"title":"So much better than 2010 movie.","review":"To be honest I never saw the movie only the trailer and a few clips. I knew that it was going to be a really bad movieNow as for this show I really like because it was reborn and also Netflix did the research which made me happy.Now the only problem I have with the show is that the script is very weak and corny. I am enjoying everything else but the scripts and writing is the only thing that I have a problem with. I think they did not think that the viewers would noticed LOL. Which laughable because this is the era of internet opinions and people can be picky half the time. But this time around I am a little picky also.If Netflix does do a 2nd season with this show then I hope they get better writers. Other wise everything in this show is really good.","rating":"8\/10","date":"23 February 2024"}
{"title":"Pretty close but certainly not there","review":"I loved avatar as a kid. When the live action was announced I was skeptic like many others. But I changed my mind after hearing the original creators were involved.However just like Avatar, they disappeared. Unfortunately due to a 'creative disagreement' with Netflix they left. Which is sad. Surely must be Netflix's fault because they change too many things nowadays.However, when the show aired I still wanted to watch it. I actually blew me away at the beginning, however after a few episodes in, I could see why the creators must have left. The visuals, music, costumes, sets and (most) casts are amazing. Firelord Ozai, Iroh Katara, Sokka, Aang and Sukki all fit perfectly.The show squirms a lot of episodes from the animated series into single episodes of the remake. Which makes sense because those episodes are short. However the 2024 remake does a lot of this. Plots points are changed, rearranged or completely left out. While still mentioned in later episodes. Meaning some happend off-screen. You'd guess they might leave things out so the show doesn't leave it's pace. However a pace isn't even truly set. The animated series was always portrayed as a race against time. Aang has a limited time to master the elements and stop the Firelord. However the live action doesn't bring up this 'race' until the very last minute. Aang has to learn the elements sure, but it felt like there were little stakes at play. They didn't even say anything about him Water bending until the last few minutes. Furthermore the show does shine bright where it can actually go into more details about the (side)characters. For example Zuko's crewmen.I'd wish they'd stick to the source material some more because almost everything but the plot and some writing is amazing. Except the casting for Azula and Mai. Shame.","rating":"7\/10","date":"3 March 2024"}
{"title":"The effects were decent","review":"I wanted to like this, but unfortunately it is a hollowed out shell of the story, with no charm or playfullness.Every line of dialogue feels like it was read of a piece of paper. It's all really bland and uninspired, and so contrived: no one acts like an acting human being, they all feel like npc's in a video game. Sometimes, characters in the background even stop what they are doing while two main characters are having a talk. It's just all so forced and unbelievable :(\nIf you haven't seen the animated original series, please do yourself a favor and watch that one. It is so much more than this. The little emotion i did feel while watching, was because of all the nostalgic resemblances to the original series, not because of any new or transformative work.I was looking forward to hearing the soundtrack, but i'm sad to say that it is not much better. The original themes are in there, and they are the highpoint of the score, the rest is just generic orchestral action and suspense stuff.But the effects were decent.","rating":"5\/10","date":"22 February 2024"}
{"title":"Watched with an open mind but still...","review":"While the VFX, bending and environments mostly look good, the usage of greenscreen is blatantly noticable and it feels like I am watching a big cosplay show inspired by the original ATLA. While I get not always being able to film on location, with how obvious the greenscreen is the immersion of the story just falls a bit flat in my opinion.And though design-wise the production team really nailed the creatures, wardrobe and environments from source material, through the way of filming and editing, a lot just feels fake. In comparison to an abundance of medium views and close-ups, it becomes noticable there aren't many wide-view shots to even visuals out throughout an episode.The biggest downer of this adaption hower is how the fun and lovable characters are completely gone or simply not compelling enough. The acting was not solid and watching the main gaang being all business 24\/7 leaves no room for forging believable bonds with one another and by the end of the last episode, it just doesn't feel as if the strong-implied-friendship made is real. The only actual chemistry felt in the whole show was between Zuko and Iroh.Next to that, due to maybe a lack of experience and weird scripting it also felt at times as if the main gaang were being outperformed by side characters such as Zhao, Teo and his father (honorable mentioms to them by the way.)\nThis also brings up another point, the awkward dialogue and blatant exposition in this adaptation is truly awful. Being spoonfed the lore of the ATLA world or having characters say their inner thoughts aloud is not the way to go for existing fans nor newcomers and honestly just dumbs down the series a whole lot.All in all, main plot is rushed, acting could be better, exposition and dialogue is exasperating, choreography, designs and visuals are stunning but cinematography feels off.This adaptation has the potential to be great, but not with how it stands currently.","rating":"6\/10","date":"26 February 2024"}
{"title":"Very enjoyable to watch but definitely not perfect","review":"Alright, so here's the tea on Netflix's live-action \"Avatar: The Last Airbender\" adaptation. As someone who practically grew up with the original show, I was hyped for this, but it's a bit of a mixed bag.First off, let's talk visuals. They nailed it! The bending scenes are straight-up epic, and the CGI is on point. I was legit holding my breath during some of those fight scenes-they were that good.But then there's the pacing. Like, they tried to cram so much into each episode that it feels kinda rushed, especially in the beginning. You know those moments that hit you right in the feels in the original? Yeah, they kinda lost some of their impact 'cause they sped through 'em.And don't even get me started on the changes they made. Like, I get that they had to switch things up a bit for the live-action vibe, but some of it just felt unnecessary. Like, why mess with perfection?But hey, it's not all bad. The casting was pretty spot on. Aang, Katara, Sokka, Zuko-they all brought their A-game. And even though they tweaked some stuff, they still captured the heart and soul of the original series. Like, the friendship vibes and the whole journey of self-discovery? Still there, thank the spirits!Overall, if you're a die-hard \"Avatar\" fan like me, you'll probably still dig it despite its flaws. Just go in with an open mind and remember to appreciate the good stuff. Plus, it's got me pumped for more adventures in the \"Avatar\" universe, so there's that!","rating":"8\/10","date":"1 March 2024"}
{"title":"It was ok","review":"It made me mad that some of the things were cut out like Aang and katara did no go into the cave with each other and to get their way throw they did not use love but they added sokka and katara instead and that's weird but whatever but what really got is how they had two episodes in one and how characters that did not even meet each other meet out of nowhere also\nWhy did they introduce Azula? That fast she came at the end of season one and what mad me even more mad is how book one is about aang learning water bending and katara taught him how a first and they did not in at all and how did they make it all the way to the southern air, Temple when they were first at the South Pole witch also does not make sense and.

{"title":"How do you remake the best t.v. show ever written?","review":"Although there are many issues with the remake, it is actually very impressive. This remake is darker and has new plot lines. The remake combines many of the original episodes. Some of that is done well some is done horribly. The casting is perfect, set design, music, and pacing is near perfect. The child actors do a fantastic job. This show is meant for individuals who didn't watch the original and original fans who have aged. The only major issue I have with the show is the lack of humor. I miss the potty humor and the goofy scenes that filled the original. Die hard fans of the original will have some reservations but will appreciate many different aspects of this modern masterpiece.","rating":"8\/10","date":"28 February 2024"}

I know that some things have to change but not entire storylines . Characters feel like that are missing something, set pieces look good . Moreover , they took pieces and little things out of everything and they tried to blend it all together with out explaining, just for the viewer to kinda feel nostalgic of the original . I am not hating it , but I cannot like this either . Some key moments from the OG feel forced and a bit rushed . Casting is excellent though.","rating":"6\/10","date":"23 April 2024"}
{"title":"The Right Way","review":"Avatar The Last Airbender. The most unexpected series I have seen on NETFLIX, my expectations heading into this series was not the best, with the reputation NETFLIX has on making animated series a live remake. This series pushed my expectations and burst it out of the roof. The pacing of the plot could be improved and with some adjustments it would be perfect, but visuals was the one thing that stood out to me, the colours was bursting with the story. Having proper actors and respecting the vision behind AVATAR was also important the casting director was good with their choices. Following the vision of AVATAR and staying with the plot is also important and i felt they respected the initial plot of AVATAR.","rating":"8\/10","date":"1 March 2024"}
{"title":"Lacking its own magic","review":"Comparing this show to the original animated run is an exercise in disappointment. The Nickelodeon series has a certain magic to it, and has a certain inimitable quality that, to a certain extent, puts any subsequent adaptation on the back foot.This Netflix series clearly has some understanding of this, and is framed in a different light as a result. Some viewers may lament the loss of a certain degree of levity and goofiness that was a feature of the original, largely absent from this version. In the tone that this series is trying to achieve, however, it would have been awkward, and inappropriate. Its a creative decision that is disappointing, but probably necessary.In my mind, that is why you should watch this version without constantly thinking back to the original - it grows in stature if you allow it to stand on its own.Visually speaking, I was really impressed. Set design and costumes felt genuine and tactile, and visual effects were fantastic. Special mention should be given to the choreography - each fight felt punchy (ha), without any of the floaty, uncertain movements of the 2010 film.In addition, enough credit cannot be given for the casting - there was clearly a concerted effort to represent each nation's inhabitants with accurate ethnic corrolaries. After the confused inconsistency of the 2010 film, seeing that consideration was wonderful, and it made the world feel genuine.None of this is to say that the series is without its flaws. The first episode is especially plagued with awkward, stilted performances and Shyamalan-esque writing. That being said, the acting is largely excellent in subsequent episodes, and while the dialogue is occassionally spotty, it certainly gets better.Cormier's line deliveries are a little breathless to me - he has a tendency to rush out the words all together, without a great deal of emphasis, and close behind the previous speaker. How much of that is the fault of the editing bay is hard to say - more likely than not simply the result of a young actor. Its not bad per se, perhaps a choice made on his part that sometimes doesn't quite ring true. Apart from that, his more quiet, reflective version of Aang remains a loveable focus character.My only other unresolved gripe in this area is the portrayal of Sokka. In this more focused, darker and altogether more serious Avatar, he is certainly the character that suffers most from the change. There are certainly attempts (albeit infrequent) to place him in his comic relief role, but they land pretty flat. Admittedly, I don't love Ousley in the part. He doesn't embody the youthful, physically expressive Sokka with his signature bravado well at all. Definitely disappointing.Katara is much better. Tarbell was well cast, and embodies the character and her growth over the season with a compelling performance. The pacing of her bending development is a little awkward, at least visually speaking. We do see her speak with Aang and Jet and read the waterbending scroll, but it's jarring to see her suddenly accelerated competence at the latter end of the series, especially given the fact that she and Sokka are mostly absent for two episodes, being asleep in the spirit realm.I was a little uncertain on Iroh initially. Mako's Iroh was a little oblivious, a bit doddering on the surface, which really gave him his charm. Lee's Iroh is a bit more focused, a bit more involved, and generally less philosophical. Its a change, but Lee's performance remains one of the best. I was a bit torn on the series' more active reference to his son, but it wasn't used in a superficial, expositional manner, but to lend a really compelling weight to his development with his relationship with Zuko - a respectful use of one of the series' most significant plot points.Speaking of Zuko, his portrayal is similarly excellent. I want to especially mention his physicality - I understand that Liu, through his martial arts background, performed Zuko's stunts and elaborate choreography, and that really shines through. It really makes the difference when you can tell its not a stunt double, the character's emotions can be expressed in the moment, so props there.My final word has to be on the series' score. Furukawa's composition manages to integrate the musical language and themes of the original while expanding the scope into this more epic format, and it especially shines through in the series' \"wow\" moments - for me: Aang emergence from the ice, Kyoshi's return through Aang, and Aang's return from the Water Sprit Avatar.While the show falls just short of really having its own identity, I'm still looking forward to the second season.","rating":"7\/10","date":"23 February 2024"}

Episode 1 showed that there's a chance that this will be an amazing season. But coming from someone who loved the cartoon series, I felt disappointed. Maybe I have expected too much.Could've been really better and they really should've focused on Book 1 alone. But hey the cinematic experience was still amazing!

{"title":"Bad Writing and Acting","review":"The first movie adaptation was horrible. This is significantly better, but still shares many of the same issues as last time. Weird pronunciation of words like avatar. The writing is not compelling. Actors are high school drama quality. Being good at acting is more important than being a black belt. The creators of the TV show left the project. Whoever decided they knew better than the creators should've been fired on the spot. This is why the quality of TV these days is poor.

{"title":"\"They had one job!\" *sigh*","review":"It is unfortunate to have a highly anticipated reboot falter, especially a second attempt at a reboot. I'm fan of the nickelodeon series and understood that a live action reboot may have issues story wise. Converting 20 stories into a single season that's palatable and long enough for the average viewer is necessary. But it's one thing to claim that you've MADE \"Avatar the Last Airbender\" when it's been stripped of its core.The biggest issue this series had was character development. Which is a laughable issue to have when you have a clear and concise blueprint already made. They've replaced the foil of each character from the original series with shallow issues that are resolved with a few minutes of poorly written dialogue.Examples of character development necessary to this story, that was removed or changed, include:Sokka's arrogance in his interactions with every character in the show.Katara's struggle with putting her bending over people's safety (the waterbending scroll).Aang's bending (Fire and Water) that inspires very good development with Katara and a developed fear of fire bending.Aang's ignorance and carefree demeanor that was reduced to a single line ( I'm silly and carefree) rather than showing his wanting to be a child and neglect his duties as the Avatar.King Bumi's identity and motivations revealed before trials and conflict.The premature introduction of Azula and her struggle with gaining respect from Ozai (she never needed that approval, she had the power and confidence when introduced in the second season and was shown to have fault in the third season.) Azula's character arc is the most interesting off all and it's been shattered now by an added layer of exposition that exposed her faults as a character and didn't focus on her power as a villain.Ozai's repeated appearance is a new feature. What makes the big bad a big bad is keeping it out of sight. If the characters are trying to stay away from the fire nation, don't show it and instigate fear within the story.The absence of Aang's crush on Katara (I figured they would at least allude to it) instead they give up one of the best scenes in the second seasons (SECRET TUNNEL) and shove it into a episode with 4 rotating storylines.Zuko's impulsivity and action based decision making, now reduced to whining.Zhao's obsession with fame and glory and inability to control his anger, reduced to a poorly written echo.Gyatzo's mentorship lacking a necessary feat for Aang's development; spontaneity and fun.Suki's confidence and stride now reduced to having a crush on Sokka.The rules of the spirit world and spirits were melded with; with Kho is was the lack of why he steals faces in the first place (he feeds off emotions), Katara and Sokka having the ability to travel into the spirit world.Taking away the Master aspect of the show, are we to believe Katara naturally gets better without a Master? And wasn't Aang supposed to learn from Pakku instead of being judged for not having learned waterbendeing?Hiding behind the excuse that the live action show needed to be different is weak. They promised ATLA and took away what made the show lovable, its characters. This was a messy rendition. The writers failed to create something new with old material, they reduced it. It's commercialized and lazy. You would think with a 20 million dollar budget on each episode, that they would have the means to make it worthwhile.These are a lot of examples, but it's everything I've noticed watching. The've expanded on a couple of themes and moments within the show that made it more interesting. Adding the consequence of Aang merging with the Ocean spirit was cool, and perhaps the most interesting part. I think they should focus on that kind of expansion on themes from the original source material a bit more. I would watch another season, but they need to do better. They need to stick with the original source material. And they would have to let Michael Dante DiMartino and Bryan Konietzko take the reins on writing.","rating":"5\/10","date":"2 March 2024"}

It was a weird middle ground that made you question who the audience was supposed to be. I liked some of the new additions but for the love of everything holy \"show don't tell\". The amount of time they spend talking with unremarkable dialogue and acting drags this show down when it could have been an 8 or 9\/10 show. I hope they get a chance to write the second season and have it be less messy and badly written. Make the characters more interesting. Right now it's just too bland and lacks direction compared to the original which managed to do it with 20 minute episodes each containing its own story. Their source material is so strong that it's surprising when they make a sloppy choice as if they didn't know a good way to make the scene make sense.","rating":"6\/10","date":"8 May 2024"}

{"title":"Taken as Independent Project, Entertaining and Fun","review":"The key to enjoying the show and seeing it for what it does well is to not compare it to the animated show. I found the visual effects of the first season to be beautiful and honestly was captivated on knowing what was coming next. I honestly enjoyed most of the characters and especially the more supernatural elements like the spirits and animals.What made me a bit upset, though, was how the characters were developed. Katara's entire water bending story was rushed with most of her new skills being gained off screen. Sokka had virtually no development other than his little \"you are an engineer\" thing. Zuko felt a bit dry and lacked energy it seemed at times, but honestly was not terrible. Iroh was definitely done well and new insights into his character made his character overall even better.What disappointed me the most was Aang and how he did not develop at all over the entire season aside from maybe small things. How does he not learn water bending at all during the first season? Why does he keep bringing up that everything is his fault every episode? His character was definitely not interesting despite this being his show.To wrap this up, I still find the show very enjoyable and the things they did with combining plots into one episode was honestly well done. How they approached the spirit world felt refreshing and honestly made me a bit terrified of it, in a good way. Aang contacting Roku, Kuruk and Kyoshi throughout the show was also fascinating, even if they were objectively not helpful and could have been ignored. The visual effects definitely help with keeping this show watchable, but for the next seasons, if there will be more, they have to focus on actually showing character development.","rating":"7\/10","date":"25 February 2024"}

{"title":"Avatar Live action is Mediocre","review":"The live-action Avatar series is... mediocre; many of its successes are overshadowed by significant flaws where it strips away the essence that defines certain characters, reducing them to something simpler and far from epic or transcendent, unlike its original series. Despite the effort to adapt a series with a lot of love and dedication behind it, this new installment feels like a mere compensation for the disaster that was its first attempt in the infamous 2010 movie. However, even though it's better than that, it falls short in creating its own identity that could serve as a catalyst for a fair and deserved adaptation on par with the original or, at the very least, evoke a fresh and new feeling that truly leaves the viewer wanting more. One thing I have to say about this new live-action is that it gives me hope that they'll deliver something where it's evident they put in more effort.","rating":"6\/10","date":"3 March 2024"}

{"title":"A Decent Adaptation","review":"As a die hard fan, there is no escaping comparisons to the original. This is a fairly faithful adaptation in many aspects but deviates from the source material in places where it really matters.To give credit where it's due, the environment, costumes, makeup and effects are stunning. The world has been brought to life and it is incredibly immersive - but also faithful. It's clear a lot of work went into making things look and feel modern without ruining the aura of the original. Every location is instantly recognizable to fans but it's illustrative theming works wonders for even a first time watcher. No complaints here. The fighting choreography isn't bad when it gets going but there are budget limitations without a doubt which do cause fights to end early and they often throw in more hand to hand combat than necessary to save on animation and digital effects that a long form bending fight would require.On the other hand, both the actors and acting are a mixed bag. The older and clearly more experienced actors do a great job. Iroh and Ozai for example mimic their animated counterparts extremely well in both likeness and demeanor. I'm not expecting a 1:1 copy; obviously these are human beings and not drawn characters so some compromises have to be made, yet many of the characters do land.With that being said, some really don't. And generally speaking it's the child actors which also happened to be the most important characters. Aang and Katara especially just do not align with how they are represented in the original. Whether it be a lack of experience, lack of direction or the changes to the script, it just doesn't work. Aang is probably the biggest miss which hurts the most.Part of this has to be that there are actors this time, not just voice actors. You can't exactly have a 20 year old playing a 12 year old on screen, but this is completely possible in animated works. There isn't a great way to solve this issue, but it still ruins many lines nonetheless. Zuko doesn't have the anger and pain in his deep voice while Aang lacks the fun loving and determined aura he always has. It is especially bad when multiple young characters are on screen together. I mean Azula, Mai and Ty Lee look and sound nothing like how they are supposed to and I honestly ended up laughing the first time they were on screen together.Lastly, the story. It got shaken up quite a bit but the key elements are mostly there. If you are a fan you will be scratching your head in many moments thinking \"that's not how this happened\" and it can be off putting. Stripping out \"filler\" content is inevitable when condensing the show to 8 episodes and you do lose a lot of character building in the moments taken out but it's not the end of the world. They did however make some pretty drastic changes to many of the reasons, beliefs and emotions that play huge roles in the original. This is the most unforgivable sin and it feels like the writers completely misunderstood the creators intentions. There are times when the motivation for an event is just completely at odds with how the original conveyed it and it ends up landing horribly. This is true even for someone who hasn't seen the anime because of how they failed to capture the emotional weight the scene by changing it up.Overall, it's not bad. If you aren't already a fan but like fantasy you will probably enjoy it. The script has its weaknesses and the child actors are a let down at times but the world building and authenticity does immerse you in a good time. If you are a fan, forget about the events matching up and the characters having the same emotional weight behind their decisions. It's no where near as good as the masterpiece which is the original.. but it's a fun watch anyway.","rating":"7\/10","date":"28 February 2024"}
{"title":"It's so bad.","review":"The hole spirit of the original series is completely gone. They put some key elements of the original one together and cold it an adaption. I'm sooo extremely disappointed. Everything essencial is completely lost, like Sokkas humour, which was one of the best parts of the series, kataras strong will is shown in such a ridiculous way, Azula doesn't show her socipathic tendencies, but is shown as a jealous sister. Besides all other side storylines don't go together. It's all just a mix up of the occuring events of the original series. I could just watch it until episode 4 before it was too boring to go on.","rating":"3\/10","date":"22 February 2024"}
{"title":"Soulless narrative, excellent production quality.","review":"Avatar: The Last Airbender\" has solidified its status as a cultural phenomenon, largely due to its meticulous world-building and the dynamic development of its characters. From its visually stunning landscapes to its captivating narrative arcs, the series initially captivates audiences. However, there are moments where rushed explanations betray a hint of lazy writing, undermining the depth of the storytelling.Characters like Katara and Sokka, while initially engaging, are depicted with an excess of purity, lacking the nuanced flaws and complexities that would make them more relatable and multidimensional. Sokka's early portrayal as somewhat misogynistic and Katara as overly motherly in the cartoon version added depth to their characters, reflecting the societal roles forced upon them. Similarly, Aang's characterization showed progress from someone who initially was unprepared and immature, but who remained good despite trauma. His lack of preparation became his biggest strength.This journey was extensive, and while the narrator understood it, explaining such complexities detracts from the depth of their journey, reducing it to a formulaic superhero trope that has been overdone in countless narratives. It's a risk that threatens to diminish the uniqueness of the series, likening it to other franchises that have fallen victim to the homogenizing \"Star Wars treatment.\" As much as \"Avatar: The Last Airbender\" excels in many aspects, there's a danger in glossing over intricacies that could elevate it to even greater heights of storytelling excellence.","rating":"7\/10","date":"23 February 2024"}
{"title":"Amazing! A lot better than expected. They did ATLA Justice!!","review":"It is not a 1:1 adaptation but that is a good thing because it's very good in its own way. It has been amazing so far. Ian as sokka is incredible! Gordon as aang is surprisingly great. They did such a great job. Once I saw one piece in August I had a gut feeling ATLA would be good. Then I saw the trailer and I KNEW it would be good. Then I heard some questionable things leading up to the release and I got worried but it's safe to say this show is AMAZING! The special effects are on point and it just feels amazing. It's a different feel from the animated version but this is still a high quality feeling I get from this show. <3.","rating":"9\/10","date":"22 February 2024"}
{"title":"Cool Concept, Bad Acting, and Logical Inconsistencies","review":"Haven't seen the cartoons so coming fresh into thisSo first, is it me or is Aang the laziest protagonist ever? I understood that he was supposed to be learning all the elements and in the entire first season he took exactly zero lessons on any element save air. It wasn't like he wasn't around any bending experts. Hard to root for the guy when he puts zero work into upping his avatar game.Point being, there are so many logical inconsistencies here that it's hard to ignore. Why is Aang afraid of falling off cliffs or through the air when he is an airbender? Why can't waterbenders just make people explode (I'm sure there is a good reason for this beyond a PG rating but I was never told)?The child acting is mostly poor and their script dialogue was left wanting. I get that this is a young adult show but at least give them a chance at dialogue that isn't overly wooden.The fights and adventure are fun, the scenery is beautiful, and the concept is great. The show sputters after episode 3 or so and begins a downhill slide.All that said, I got through the season and will likely give a second season a shot. Just a bummer because this could have been so much more!","rating":"6\/10","date":"8 April 2024"}
{"title":"Ignore these haters","review":"I watched the original Avatar and it's one of my favorite shows of all time. Netflix's live action adaptation is obviously not has good as the original, but what they're trying to do is great. They aren't trying to be just like the original and i believe that is why it's getting so much hate. A lot of these bad reviews are just people hating to hate because they have absolutely nothing better to do. If there isn't something to complain about they have to create something to complain about. But one of the biggest complaints I have heard from people is the CGI and I highly disagree. I think it looks great. It will definitely take some time to get used to characters like Azula and Zuko but I think people will eventually get used to them in later seasons. Music is perfect in this, action sequences are great, and the new additions to the story in this are some of the best parts. Where it does fall flat is making our main characters seem like close friends, in the original they seem like great friends right away and the dynamic is great, but in this the dynamic isn't really believable which is one of the best parts of the original. But I think if people stop trying to compare this to the original (Which is very hard to do) and think of it as it's own thing I believe people will really like this and I can't wait to see where this goes.","rating":"8\/10","date":"25 February 2024"}
{"title":"Good but rushed","review":"I love the animated last airbender and they made a good choice for the actors especially Aang. The laugh and despair is very well portraited by him.The special effects are done really well, although the flying Aang without kite is a bit awkward.Furthermore they can not make as many episodes as the cartoon ofcourse but it felt rushed. Not really character development or moments where you could see the friendship of team avatar grow. It all went really fast which gave it not as much depth. For example they did not show a lot of the chemistry in team avatar. Just adventure after adventure, not one episode where they were just travelling and talking and grew to understand each other more deeply.Overall like to watch it though, had low expectations and it was better than expected. :)","rating":"7\/10","date":"3 March 2024"}
{"title":"Feels like a fresh take on fantasy","review":"After finally watching all 8 episodes, I think I can give a valid opinion on the show, having watched the animated series twice and being a huge fan of Avatar.I'd like to preface with something I've heard, that the show looks fake. Especially because of the costumes. I disagree. It feels more lively. Gives me LOTR vibes, colorful and alive. And that's - I think - how fantasy should be.First of all, the casting deserves an 8\/10. Some characters felt a little off but the protagonists are perfect.Second, the writing and the way the story is told, deserves a 6.7\/10. That's because I feel like they skipped over some of the important -to the fans- parts, but it was still very engaging and interesting to the end. That's what I expected however, since it's just an adaptation.Third, the vfx and the costumes are simply amazing. Something I didn't really expect from an adaptation and a Netflix show. To that I would give a 9\/10. The CGI of the animals, Momo and Appa is on point. The costumes are exactly like in the animated series and the bending is how I imagined it would in real life while I was watching as a kid.All in all, it's certainly a fun little adventure to embark on, will entertain you and if you have similar taste as me you'll want more.","rating":"8\/10","date":"24 February 2024"}
{"title":"You guys can still turn this around!!!! Please!?!","review":"The casting and visual effects in my opinion were fantastic! So far I am impressed but nervous.I can look past cramming parts of the story together to condense the important parts of what makes this show amazing, and the weird interaction between Sokka and the Kyoshi warriors, but what I'm most nervous for is AZULA!!One of the most well written characters I've ever seen is currently being butchered!!!! I can't tell if it's the acting or writing but omg they have to fix this. It's like they're setting her up to have Zuko's character arc, when in reality she is Zuko's ultimate villain! She should be a narcissistic psychopath who commands attention and devotion, doesn't respect anyone around her, and slowly slips farther down the path of insanity. Where is her manipulation of people and her heartless power of reading and toying with others?? It's one of the best character developments and it's like the writers are trying to set her up to have a character change and be a good person by the end of the show.I really really hope I'm wrong and over reacting because this would ruin the show for me personally.One of the characteristics that made the original show so powerful is how it hinted at real issues we face in our own world. Genocide and war, the sick way the Zuko's father treated him vs Azula, the way women fight and have some of the best strength in the show. Each character is so uniquely developed and I hope that is respected because that is what made the original show so great, and will make this show great too. Please fix this so the villains are set up properly to make a great story.","rating":"7\/10","date":"3 March 2024"}

I was definitely sceptical when I heard this was going to be released because I'm such a fan of the animated version. But I can honestly tell you that I was pleasantly surprised. It was incredible. One thing we have to talk about is the music. Wow what an epic experience they created with the soundtrack. All in all, epic!!!!!!!!!","rating":"9\/10","date":"24 February 2024"}
{"title":"This is Zuko story","review":"I love avatar, I use to wake up and run downstairs to watch the OG show. So when this came out I was really excited. But after the first episode I was left disappointed. But continuing on with the show it got a little better. The special Fx are amazing, but the characters lack except for Zuko. Zuko and uncle Iroh carry the show. Instead of watching it for aang, I started watching it for Zuko. So if you dare to watch this show, start watching it for Zuko story and you will love it more. This show has a lot of true potential and I hope to see it grow. The first season is alright. There is a lot of work to be done but I'm excited.","rating":"7\/10","date":"18 March 2024"}
{"title":"Too many changes that don't make sense","review":"I was so excited for this. I knew there were going to be changes, but these changes don't make sense. The biggest slap in the face is replacing Roku with Kyoshi. This was a lazy & misguided attempt to adapt ATLA into live action. It's not as bad as the M Night film from years back, but it's still a big disappointment. It makes complete sense that the original creators walked away from the project. People who are supposedly passionate about ATLA made this. I wish I could've been in the room to see & hear why they made the decisions they did. Roles reversed, I would never have let these decisions fly. Another situation where the people adapting the story have to throw their own stupid ideas into the mix. Shame on the production team.","rating":"1\/10","date":"23 February 2024"}
{"title":"Katara's actress couldn't act if her life depended on it ...","review":"Honestly, I'd rather we got a darker rendition, marketed exclusively for adults, than this charmless attempt to capitalise on nostalgia...But, let's start with the positives. The CGI and technical effects were great and there were a couple additions that enhanced on the original material. The most notably welcoming one was having Zuko's crew be the battalion he argued against sacrificing in the rendition of \"The Storm\", which better explained why they'd end up respecting him. Taking the time to show the Fire Nation's attack on the Air Nomads was also a pleasant surprise.And that's pretty much it... The biggest issue with the live action is how they completely missed the mark with character design. Aang was not joyful, Sokka was not funny, Azula, the child prodigy, was shown to be highly insecure and neither her nor Ozai were menacing or threatening enough. Ozai's relationship with Zuko was also a miss.Character portrayal aside, the whole season felt rushed. There is no good reason why they'd cramp so many storylines in only a few episodes, yet add so many out of place elements (Wan Shi Tong, fog of lost souls, Mother of Faces statue, Guru Patik in spirit world, Avatar Kuruk and of course... emotions feeling baggermoles). Ironically, Aang didn't even have time to master waterbending...Overall, wasted potential.","rating":"","date":"6 April 2024"}
{"title":"Finding Magic After the Original: A Review of Avatar: The Last Airbender - Netflix adaptation","review":"Imagine you never saw the original before this?ATLA is somewhat decent adaptation that will likely seem average to many viewers, especially if you have seen the original. However, I believe this reception stems from the immense weight of expectations placed on it. The original animated series remains an undisputed masterpiece, and equaling, let alone topping, such brilliance is an incredibly tough if not an impossible challenge. Though this is a common issue for Netflix adaptations, ATLA also faces the unique pressure of living up to a series many consider nearly perfect as an animated show can be.Yet despite these challenges, I found ATLA to be worthwhile viewing overall, especially to new viewers. The adaptation makes certain changes that give it a distinct identity from the source material, add to that a refreshing takes on casting, visuals, and cultural representation being particularly impressive, when compare to the other live-action. In fact, when compared to other live-action, these elements make this adaptation look top tier. While I sincerely hope that the second season build upon the first and smooth out some rough patches, this initial outing delivers an experience that, at its best moments, recaptures a little glimpses of the original's magic - even if it falls short of fully reaching those great heights.","rating":"7\/10","date":"23 February 2024"}

True that it doesn't have the humor and fluffy warmheartedness of the original but overall a solid adaptation, especially when comparing it to the M Knight blasphemous version.

{"title":"This was so good.","review":"I am a fan of the original animated series. I am not a fan of the M Night Shaymalan movie. What makes this live action series great for me is the casting. The main cast character I fell in love with is Uncle Iroh played by Paul Sun-Hyung Lee. I thought that Mako defined this role, but I was wrong. Paul's Uncle Iroh is so endearing, supportive and cares and that caring goes beyond Zuko, he cares about the world. I feel Paul was born to play this role. I also thought that Daniel Dae Kim does an excellent job playing Firelord Ozai. He plays Ozai as a coniving, manipulative, power hungry character, that is a terrible father. I love the complexity of this evil character. The other standout character and actor is Amber Midthunder as Princess Yue. She played this character so close to the animated series, it was uncanny. I also loved the choices for Aang, Katara, and Sokka. They were right on the mark for playing these characters versus the movie. Gordon Cormier, Kiawentiio and Ian Ousley were perfect for the roles. I also loved animated Appa. This character is the best Appa of the three. I loved his tale and his face. Also, the special effects for the Water, Earth, and Fire bending is better than the movie. I do not expect live action to be as good as the animated series, but it comes very close and was satisfying for me in this live action series. What I could not believe happened to me, is that I was sucked into the series and I binge watch it the first time and could not stop watching. I was hooked on the series emotionally and was tearing up, laughing, yelling at the TV screen and all in all thoroughly engrossed in the characters and the story. I read somewhere that someone calls this a love song to Asian actots. Well, I loved all the actors in this series. The scenes that were especially impactful were finding the Avatar, visiting Kyoshi Island, finding the Southern Air Temple, visiting the Fire Temple, visiting with Bumi at Omashu and the climatic battle at the Northern Water Temple. I really hope that Netflix renews this for at two more seasons to play out the story. If not, at least I got to see this excellent live action remake and I like that they made it more for an adult audience. Thank you Netflix for an emotional good time.","rating":"9\/10","date":"26 February 2024"}
{"title":"Doesn't live up to its full potential- but it's getting there.","review":"A highly anticipated series lived up to expectations in its first season. Following the storyline of the original animated series, which resonates positively with me as a devoted fan, I therefore can say it's truly enjoyable to watch.The landscapes, cities, and characters are vividly portrayed, creating a realistic and captivating world. The action scenes and fight choreography seamlessly integrate into the series, providing an engaging viewing experience as you expect from the animated show. The CGI, visual effects, costumes, and ambiance contribute to a high-quality production, evoking a strong and immersive \"avatar\" vibe.While the acting of the main characters may occasionally feel a bit forced, this becomes less noticeable over time. The series comprises eight episodes, each offering compelling stories and well-executed action, avoiding any dull fillers or low resolution gaps between episodes.However, my main critique lies in the series' inability to deeply connect me with the characters which the animated show does verry well , leaving a somewhat shallow impression. Despite this, there's hope that the character development will evolve in the upcoming season. Overall, it's a great watch, though not reaching the level of being exceptional.","rating":"7\/10","date":"22 February 2024"}

All of the major themes are still conveyed, and no characters are butchered. The young actors are usually the downfall of shows like this, but the cast does a good job. The visual effects are downright impressive and the bending looks great.

It seems like the characters are reading off a script and sometimes the conversations make no sense.The series feels like it was written by a kid, since the minds of the crew seems more plot-driven than natural. It's no surprise the original creators walked off the project since this new director has no creativity, talent, or faithfulness to the original series.

Zuko's actor has some flash in the pan moments. Sokka's character is played fairly well. Lord Ozai is the only thing that's done really well.

About the writing for this TV Show they did a good job with the pace and especially the dialogue, Aswell with the filler scenes that we didn't get in the animated but that were mentioned in the animated.

If the actors were capable of actually acting, they could leave the camera rolling and have longer takes of matched up dialogue.But .. anywho.The CGI is shoddy, there's YouTube channels producing better CGI on a fraction of the budget.The greenscreening is awful, particularly in the first episode with a boat, it looks like something from a 90s kids show.Is it worth a watch?

The actors did their damn best and the team that CGI'd the environment gave it more than their 100%. I was pleasantly glad I got to see this show! Uncle Iroh and Zuko absolutely killed it, just a phenomenal job representing the greatest relationship and character arc that Avatar has to offer.If you're a returning fan, I recommend watching this with a new lens instead of perhaps comparing every little scene to the animation.

{"title":"Love it!","review":"People always have something to complain about. I don't understand these bad reviews. Yes it's not exactly the same, and yes maybe its not as funny as the original et cetera. But its impossible to make the live action exactly the same as the original, while also keeping the quality. A live action is just way different then a cartoon. Actually, the small changes in the story or the 'extra's', I like them.The story is almost the same, the acting is very good (reminds me of the characters in the original one), and the visuals are amazing.I recommend less people complain, so we get a season 2 and 3.","rating":"9\/10","date":"29 February 2024"}
{"title":"Pretty good","review":"The visuals were top notch, the stylistic choices were good too. I think it's unfair to expect a live-action version of something to be the same as the cartoons, the whole point of it is to make it different. If people want to see the cartoon, go watch that. The things I disliked most about this series was the acting\/actor choices for some roles. The azula squad was really bland in their acting, they played the same character it felt like, and there was no distinction apart from their dialogue. Also the acting of Katara was pretty bad.Zuko, Aang (mostly for his age it was impressive), Suki and Yue their acting really carried the show.","rating":"7\/10","date":"23 February 2024"}
{"title":"1 and done for me","review":"Just because it's better than the live action movie does not mean it's good.The acting is the first thing that stands out. Everyone is reading their dialogue like it was the first time they ever read it. And all the dialogue is expositional. I hope this is the exposition episode and in the later episodes they start to have real spoken word. Or this show is in trouble.Zuko is the best actor. It's still all expositional but he makes it work or does his best with it.Where's the humor? Where's the character development?I know we can't capture the show exactly, but give us some light moments, some fun. I know it's the first episode but like come on the movies dialogue is starting to seem better.What's with the weird thick filter at the beginning? It's like \"no you cant see the intro, but we'll let you make out the figures\" It's like it's trying to hide the bad CG.","rating":"2\/10","date":"22 February 2024"}
{"title":"Hot garbage","review":"This is my first review ever. This show is hot garbage. No wonder the creators ditched netflix. Stop thinking you can reinvent the wheel...what a dissapointment.Cg is poor, acting is worse, script...yeh...the only thing they got right is the cinematography. This will go down as mnight 2.0.Do yourself a favor and preserve the original memory of the show by skipping this one. Netflix needs to hire better directors and fast.Insert more dtuff about review blah blah blah...wish i could but there is nothing redeemable...i need 60p characters to leave this review...lets judt ramble non sense like this show...","rating":"","date":"24 February 2024"}
{"title":"Nice Visuals\/ poor story acting","review":"I wanted to like this show so bad but unfortunately I couldn't. The first episode was decent but soon after we encounter a lot of examples of bad and stiff acting that just don't make the scenes or the whole show flow and it really does affect your enjoyment of it. Most of the visuals are pretty good, the location cgi designs and the creature designs were great and bending vfxs weren't too bad either. The final avatar state scene was actually pretty well made which impressed me. Still, because of the way the story was developed and the poor performances I lost interest and probably wouldn't watch season 2.","rating":"6\/10","date":"23 February 2024"}
{"title":"Not perfect but a solid adaptation. It's faithful, portrayals are good & the bending looks great.","review":"Episode 1 starts off with a bang, a new addition like many, which adds more lore to the already rich story of the avatar universe. The adaptation does a great job of taking elements from the animated series but adds its own stuff.While I didn't enjoy some changes, for example, omission of certain characters and changing the arc of certain characters like Bumi, it still does good.The story has a slight mature tone but that doesn't mean it 's not fun, which was the right decision. If the series was a 1:1 shot remake, it wouldn't translate well as a live action.One or two episode seem rushed but all in all, it's a solid 8\/10 adaptation. The portrayals are mostly good. I thoroughly enjoyed Zuko, Zhao & Kyoshi the most. The bending looks great and as a big fan, I can say the showrunners did a good job.","rating":"9\/10","date":"24 February 2024"}
{"title":"An Overall Downgrade and a Definite Disappointment","review":"This by no means is a terrible show and is nowhere close to as horrible as the Shyamalan movie. In many if not all aspects this show is a complete downgrade to the original masterpiece.Cons-\nCharacters:\nMost characters are not even close in development to the original. Characters like Katara and Aang feel flat. The stripped Katara of all emotion and removed all the child-like aspects of Aang. They even removed Sokka's only serious character arc in season 1 by removing his slight sexist attitude. Making his character feel like he's just their to make the audience laugh. Zuko and Iroh feel fine.Another problem is the team isn't given enough screen time together to make meaningful connections to each other like the original has.Writing:\nThe worst part of this show, that is borderline inescapable, is definitely the writing. Netflix needs to fire all of their current writers or change something because this show was hard to watch at times. There are many instances of very beginner level mistakes in the writing. Someone needs to teach them the classic, but simple, \"show not tell\".I think the actors did a very good job with what they were given but the writing was very unprofessional.Another annoying problem I had was how much was condensed in this show. There were events that were condensed into one location that just didn't feel right. Like the love tunnel, the southern air temple, and the episodes in Omashu were all smashed into the city of Omashu. Nothing really felt fluid and pieces didn't add up. The same went for the spirit world, where nothing made sense.Pros-\nVisuals: Obviously the visuals were incredible given the Netflix budget and design team being insane. The bending didn't feel weak or subdued. All of the building and battleships and the overall set was very accurate and grand.Overall:\nI can definitely see why the original creators left the project so early on. Netflix's vision for Avatar feels to thin and bland. All character depth was stripped to fit a time crunch and all the good writing was replaced with cheap novice writing.","rating":"6\/10","date":"4 March 2024"}
{"title":"A great adaptation","review":"As someone who casually watched the original cartoon as a kid and binged the whole show a few years ago, I don't have the obsessive attachment to the cartoon that many fans do. Sure, the overall mood is darker, there's a few clunky lines of exposition, events have been moved around and some character arcs have been altered, but this adaptation still tells a great, heartfelt story with some great CGI and well-choreographed fight scenes. Some may say the story seems rushed, I say they removed the filler from the original show and stuck to its most relevant plot points.It's an adaptation, not a scene-by-scene recreation. Netflix's Avatar does its own thing, but in my opinion still manages to keep the core heart and messages of the original story.","rating":"8\/10","date":"4 March 2024"}
{"title":"bland adaptation withouth any spirit","review":"I am a huge fan of the OG cartoon and I think it is one of the best written animated stories ever.While Shyamalan's adaptation was horrible, this is just disappointing.It does not capture any of the spirit from the original. It is boring and jumbled. They took random parts of the original story and just mushed them together into one huge mess.Starting of the show had a red flag for me because they used a part of the story from one of the best and most important episodes in the animated version (The Storm) and used it in the beginning without any of the weight the OG episode holds.FX are not grreat but are good.Acting is very bad, specially for the Aang character. Dialogs are very generic, story is so forced and without any depth or emotions.Sokka character is so stipped down to its basics and is not really a character at all. Katara does not have anything that resembles the one from the OG show. The girl who had to grow up too fast and gets a huge responsibility thrown at her to look out for her brother. And she was one of the great examples of strong female characters done, not just right, but great.Iroh does not have any of the goofy old man and the wise one characteristics. Zuko is kind of OK, but his dialogs are also very bland.Although I never expected this to be as good as the original show, and after really liking the trailes, I did not expect it to be so lazy and removed of any depth or emotions.Last 3 episodes I watched in about 6 minutes while skipping most of it.I dont think I will come back to season 2.","rating":"6\/10","date":"29 February 2024"}
{"title":"As solid entry into what I hope to be a continuation of the full original series","review":"Important things first: the passion for the world is there, and they knew what they were adapting. While we already knew years ago that this wouldn't be a full 1:1, changes are always a pill to swallow for some fans, even when it comes to smaller changes. I am happy to say that the core of ATLA is there, but that this feels like you are experiencing through a different lens, as if you are looking at the same artwork painted by a different artist.Meanless to say, this project feels like it has a hopeful future and after hearing the director and the cast talk about being very eager on doing the future seasons, let's hope Netflix does continue on until the end.","rating":"8\/10","date":"22 February 2024"}
{"title":"Optimistic for Book 2&3","review":"The series is way better than the movie, but sometimes feels just as a copy of the animation. Which is ok, I'm glad that they respected the source material, but some additional emotions\/conversations could've helped the arcs. Everything felt too monotonic, robotic.On the other hand, the VFX and sounds are top notch!! Some people find the casting problematic, I'm in the middle on this one, I loved Iroh's and Sokka's actors, the rest may need a bit more time.I hope there will be more seasons, for me the Book 2 and 3 very way better in the animation series as well, i did not enjoy Book 1 that much, so I think from this point the series will just improve.","rating":"7\/10","date":"25 February 2024"}
{"title":"Heart of the Original. Solid fight sequences","review":"Captures the spirit of the original series while also sorting through the filler of the cartoon's first season. If you are a die hard fan there is plenty of 1:1 recreation shots you will love! The fighting choreography really stood out. And I was surprised with how much violence they got away with at a TVPG RATING. With that being said this cast skews a bit young, and the dialogue is a reflection of that. The dynamic between the cast really grows as the episodes go on. I hope it gets renewed for season 2 because this series deserves a finished story. You can't judge this series with a bias so please leave that at the door when watching.","rating":"8\/10","date":"25 February 2024"}
{"title":"Nostalgic at times, stiff acting most of the time","review":"As a fan of the original that I have watched way too many times, the nostalgia was good. I even laughed out loud a few times!HoweverThere are moments where the acting feels way too robotic\/stiff, some lines are just so blocky that I don't even blame the actors. Now, I know that voice acting and acting are not the same, but the lack of emotion is very present.I do acknowledge that we all hold the show to very high standards due to the Nickelodeon version being very special to most of us.But what makes the original show so amazing was the story telling, the emotion that the voice actors conveyed to us and the story. If this show didn't have the original show to depend on, I don't know if I would rate it as high, as I said, nostalgia is a big factor.I miss uncle Iroh's quotes.","rating":"7\/10","date":"23 February 2024"}
{"title":"more overrated than it should be","review":"Lets ignore the overblown positive comments who were pretty clever to drop a 10\/10 review after stating they never watched the original show. Let's also ignore the overly negative reviews who are just upset fans and see whether this show holds on its own with less biases as possible (especially the controversies of the original writers leaving the show).If you had somehow convinced me to watch this \"remake\" instead of the original, i would not hold you in high regards anymore. The show is mix bag of good decisions and really horrendous decisions.To sum up everything, this is just another mediocre fantasy series from Netflix if the original series had not existed. The characters are boringly shallow and have zero chemistry each other.Our lead's character is \"just a kid\"\nKatara's character is \"just a girl who society hates\"\nand Sokka's character is \"just Katara's brother\"\nand the rest of the characters are just set pieces waiting to give you exposition.They have absolutely zero personality or any character trait's throughout the entirety of the season, they are never funny, sarcastic, have flaws they need to overcome, hold any world views\/principles, playful, or anything that would consider them a human.I would have even more shade to throw if I were to keep this review biased, I don't even like to believe its the actors' faults ever since I have seen their interviews. Their real life personalities are MUCH CLOSER to original characters than they are in the Netflix version, I have never been more infuriated from this discovery. As for the side characters, their acting is like they're reading off a script. Its like Netflix has this go-to actors every time they want to represent native Polynesian and Asian cultures, clearly a lot of passion is put through these remakes.And speaking of the writing, for a show named \"AVATAR the last Airbender\" and 1st season titled \"Water\" I would at least hope to see the avatar do avatar stuff. Aang has never touched water bending until the very last episode, there's zero telling of how big of a deal the avatar is and because every one of his moments is taken by the SIDE CHARACTERS including the ones you will see in just 1 episode. How is it possible that KATARA, the girl with no water bending skill because society has barred her to do so, was able to lift a huge 70ft wave by herself instead of the avatar when she all had was 20 secs of pep talk from Aang. What makes the avatar even special when 1 of the 2 times he does do avatar stuff, he SWAPS BODY with the past avatar (not the chronologically previous avatar in the lore sense, just conveniently the fan favorite one.They should have named the show AANG: The Airbender, and the fire nation would have never needed to wipe out the air nation since there is NO THREAT of an avatar stopping them and therefore NO PLOT for the show to exist.The writing is beyond poverty, you know its bad when Aang has to go into his every 5 minutes soliloquy about his personality instead of being the said personality. Or when every side character is just there to tell the audience of what happened as if we are blind new borns. The showrunners had the audacity to compare this to Game of thrones while treating like the audience like children.As much as the new scenes and the visuals are welcome, the writing is for sure there to tell you're watching a mediocre fantasy show from Netflix.","rating":"5\/10","date":"21 April 2024"}
{"title":"It's not good.","review":"I watched the first episode yesterday and can't bring myself to continue.The show has very good costumes, sets (real and virtual), the visual effects are quite decent, but it's all ruined by awful script and directing. While watching this I had a constant feeling that the script-writers and directors were underqualified for a production of this size. I'm going to explain why I think that below, so if you're just intrested in whether you should give it a try - no you shouldn't. It doesn't matter if you're a fan of the originals or not - the show just doesn't deliver what it promised.My main gripe with writing\/directing is that it rushes or skips entirely important things (such as character development) and instead wastes it on needless plot events. For example, during the first 20 minutes we get 3 backstory introductions. One is a 10 minute scene where the Firelord explains his evil plan, second when we see his plan in action and third when our protagonist's grandma explains it to us (which is taken verbatim from the original show's intro). All of this before we even start caring about what's happening. In the meantime we get only the most basic character introductions.I have more issues with this show but without resolving this main problem they're not even worth mentioning.","rating":"","date":"23 February 2024"}
{"title":"Totally blown away.","review":"I honestly think a lot of people decided they weren't going to like this show before they even watched it. I can't say I had high hopes myself but I kept an open mind and I'm completely floored.The effects, the settings, the music are all absolutely top notch, but that would mean nothing without a good cast, and this show has an amazing cast. While it's true that some cast members are more experienced than others, this only adds to the feeling of a bunch of wide-eyed kids who haven't yet found their feet in life taking on something far bigger than they are. The feeling of \"people pulling together and doing their best\" is heavily accentuated by the greenness of most of the actors.I was delighted to find that Aang is no longer the ludicrously wacky cartoon character seen in the original. He has a great balance of being lighthearted without being a clown, and serious without being melodramatic.The guy playing Sokka feels like he was genetically designed for the part and feels much more believable and relatable than the original voice actor, who was way too hammy and derpy.I didn't think anyone could top the original Katara, who carried the show imo, but the new actress is truly something else and undoubtedly has a sparkling career ahead of her.Yes, the story is presented with far less depth than the original but the presentation suits the live action format brilliantly. I see this as an exceptionally well crafted companion piece to the original, and I feel sorry for those who fail to see the magic in this show.If they cancel it due to people who can't loosen up and enjoy something different to what they're used to, I'll consider it a great loss.","rating":"10\/10","date":"23 February 2024"}
{"title":"Greatness wants to be unleashed, but...","review":"The story is fantastic, the characters already established are fantastic, it has a Netflix sized budget\/production at its disposal, it even has a predecessor to look towards in terms of what not to do to be better and yet the acting of the younger characters is what really holds this show from being great. The script also is wooden at times and over explains rather than shows you that emotion, payoff, etc. Every episode had its moment to shine and some did while others felt like it was being rushed, made, or acted by mediocrity. I sure hope they focus on getting the younger cast to ask more authentic rather than sounding like they are reciting lines for a play. Fingers crossed!","rating":"7\/10","date":"29 February 2024"}
{"title":"A Wonderful Adaptation","review":"To improve on perfection is impossible. But this show does a hell of a good job of trying to keep up.Firstly we are spoiled by modern VFX. The fight choreography and bending CGI is nothing short of spectacular.The show did an incredibly good job telling certain stories like Sokka and Zuko.The writing for Ang was a bit off. They forgot they were writing for a wise child and the actor simply doesn't deliver a lot of the dialogue well.Katara is a badass but the show glosses over her bending journey turning her into a Mary Sue, which is a shame.Overall a great adaptation condensing lots of story.","rating":"8\/10","date":"26 February 2024"}
{"title":"As i barely remember the anime, this felt very similar","review":"Well, after the 2023 writer strike, this series felt like a very welcome viewing.Its got pacing issues , like sometime from one episode to the next , i was wondering about the transition. Some reviewer said its like 20 episode condensed in 8, wt critiqued alterations to characters and events. The original writers had a fight wt netflix about not following their stories.Still, it was definitely above average in everything. Sure i wish they would have followed the original anime , but that would be so many episodes,wt effects and crew, hard to make it profitable.I think they will make more seasons to complete the story but the kids and teenage actors will grow n change a lot, not sure how that will effect like a season 3, maybe the avatar will have facial hair ha ha.Seriously, for all the complains it get on imdb, and short 8 episodes(they should have go for 13), i would recommend this series to all lovers of fantasy and magic. Effects are good, acting is fine, it really feel like The last air bender world buil. Can have beed lots worse. Would hgave been great if original writers and netflix had agree together but that would have required big money investors or money launderers to injects lotssss of money.","rating":"7\/10","date":"24 February 2024"}
{"title":"The lace action is more... human","review":"It may not follow the 22 minute cartoon episodes that I've watched 4 or 5 times over the last 20 years. But there's something that human actors just bring to the story. Emotion. There is so much more depth to the story, more backstory you just can't add with a graphical representation that makes this so deep. The bending is well done and the characters are much richer when you can see the emotion in their eyes and posture. A script can only provide so much. The actors provide way more context than I could have hoped for. Forget about the differences and just hope we get to the final battle. I think the originals last four episodes will be worth seeing this one to the end.","rating":"8\/10","date":"3 March 2024"}
{"title":"Eeeehhhh","review":"I really enjoyed how Netflix adapted One Piece so I thought this would be good in good hands. I hate to admit this, but I actually prefer the movie from 2010 and that's not saying much. It's not the worst thing I've seen, but the acting from the majority of the cast, including the leads, leaves much to be desired. The CGI and costumes also do not look as a movie over that is already done a decade old. I made it to episode 4 before deciding I was disappointed and turned it off. I didn't hate it, but it was serving as background noise as I played in my phone. It was less than engaging, which is unfortunate, because it could have had the opportunity to have some food fight sequences and manipulation of the elements. Netflix missed the mark with this one.","rating":"6\/10","date":"26 February 2024"}
{"title":"Very enjoyable live action adaptation for mature audience.","review":"I wasn't really sure about this show since I was pretty much disappointed by another netflix's live action adaptation, One Piece. Many people probably don't agree with me, but for me, one piece was very juvenile and cartoony - even the costumes in the show were cartoonish. It was just another animation with real people. Why bother making a live action adaptation if they aren't gonna apply a real life seriousness into it? I can't lie that kids did enjoy One piece a lot. The reason why I have \"reviewed\" One piece so far here is because Avatar: The Last Airbender is complete opposite. I could see a lot of seriousness and efforts all over the show including the costumes. CGI on the world building and fight scenes is quite seamless. Those effects of bending elements in the fight scenes are very convincing. The overall production is quiet impressive, and sure enough to entertain mature audience. This show can easily rank in top netflix shows of all time. It's hundred miles better than One piece, and million miles better than Shyamalan's Avatar. There are some cons of the show of course, and acting skills from some of the actors were questionable at some moments. If I have to pick one con of the show, Katara in the show is way, way off from the original animation character.","rating":"8\/10","date":"24 February 2024"}
{"title":"I might not watch anymore.","review":"Avatar The Last Airbender really doesn't have a place or business being a live action adaptation and they really shouldn't have tried this AGAIN! After the Shyamalan disaster, WHY??? The only thing I will give it props for is going in a different direction with its story than the anime show originally did by showing the downfall of the Air temple\/Aang's home. I admire the different spin on some things, and how SOME of the bending looks and how they made an effort to make the characters look like their originals. Thankfully the rest of this just reminds us of how special and great the animated show was. What I hate about this: poor acting\/performances, BAD CGI when Aang flies through the air and the \"camera\" shows him up close, how bad\/dark\/thick Aang's eyebrows look, and how completely unexciting it is. My friends may watch more of this since they're real Avatar nerds, but I'm feeling so meh about it. NOT the kind of show I feel like watching more of...and not really sorry about it.","rating":"6\/10","date":"25 February 2024"}

Even the last Airbender film had better effort than this. Am i watching the same thing as the people who have rated it 9 and even 10 here? Modern media is a on a constant downward slope ever since technology made things easy for us. This is eye candy. All their attention went to cgi, costumes, pretty colors and of course *cool* camera zoom ins i e. How after every supposed moment the camera stays at the gawking dumb faces of some character for a few seconds until it focuses on the source of this amazement. Its just sad that people can form a positive opinion about these things. Laziness produced by easy life leads to poor taste in art.","rating":"3\/10","date":"22 February 2024"}
{"title":"Don't support this slop","review":"I did not finish this show. I watched the first two episodes before quitting. Thus, I am not giving it a number score. This is one of the most lifeless, passionless shows I've ever seen. This was not made because someone had a vision for what a live action Last Airbender should look like, this was made to capitalize on how popular the cartoon became once it went to Netflix. The acting is bad, the costumes look bad, the effects are mostly bad, and it has some incredibly goofy moments. The raid on the air temple in the beginning have a few, one where fire benders fly up a cliff, which looks like nuclear warheads launching. Another in which an air bender creates a tornado, only for fire benders to light said tornado and the air bender comically screams. Another huge issue is the order in which the story is told. Whoever wrote this probably saw Pulp Fiction and said \"why is it all out of order?\" Having the monks reveal to Aang that he's the avatar on top of showing the air temple raid immediately raise the stakes higher than they should be. Part of what made the beginning of the original series great was the reveal that the air genders were all dead, it seamlessly introduced grim elements into a series that had previously been entirely lighthearted. Also there's this weird issue with fire bending where it basically functions like air. People will get engulfed in flames, only to be shown with slightly tattered clothes and dirt on their face. I know the show isn't looking to be crazy violent but some amount of realism there would be an improvement. I don't plan on finishing this series, but from what I hear it at least doesn't completely butcher the source material like the previous live action movie did. But that doesn't mean you should watch this. Half of what makes the cartoon series so great is that is was animated, and trying to translate that energy into live action was what made this and the live action movie feel so awkward.","rating":"","date":"24 February 2024"}
{"title":"Pretty good except for the main cast","review":"The series looks better than I ever imagined. They nailed the architecture and looks of each civilization exceptionally well, especially with the Air Nomads and the fire nation. Also they expanded the world with new stories which fitted in very well and were overall interesting for an avatar fan. The acting and characters of suko, iroh and general zaoh was convincing and made me wanna see more of them.BUT the main cast of Sokka, Katara and Aang came very short. They didn't get many scenes to bond or to show their friendship. Also we didn't see much of their personality's and traits. Their chemistry wasn't very convincing so I had a lot of problems believing that they had formed such a strong bond in such a short time.Overall this series is pretty good. It expands the aviator story in a positive way and interprets the story in a new way which I really liked.","rating":"7\/10","date":"22 February 2024"}

{"title":"Solid, but not as good as the IMDB rating would have you believe","review":"Seeing a rating of 7.5 honestly got my hopes up, I thought that similar to One Piece this will also be a solid show, which while not a 1to1 copy of the source, will be a solid retelling.While this is a vast improvement over the older attempts at Avatar the Last Airbender, The fight scenes are great, well choreographed. Couple that with decent CGI and you get a very fun show. However, where it falls flat is choosing which parts to show and pace things properly. The acting is also absolutely abysmal, I find it hard to believe they could not find a more talented lead child actor with how many people start taking lessons early nowadays. The dialogues are also written very poorly. There seems to be a real disconnect between the teams and quality of people working behind them.Could it be worse? Sure. However, it is also not deserving of being called good. It is your average middle of the pack retelling of a famous media piece.","rating":"6\/10","date":"25 February 2024"}
{"title":"An overall great show that clearly was made with lots of love for the original","review":"Wow okay, as a huge huge Avatar fan introduced to the show as a kid, I think this show is the best possible remake we can hope to get. Remakes inherently aren't going to be a 1 to 1 direct copy, which I think people just need to adjust their expectations to a bit.I initially had holdbacks for any\/all changes to the show, but when thinking such changes through after episodes, they truly do make sense with the overall through line the show is developing. I love the first season of the animated show but this live action version certainly does a better job of establishing a consistent plot\/flow throughout the season (the animated season does have a lot of filler episodes, which I lovingly admit).The writers also clearly didn't make changes Willy Nilly, but with love and care. They reference loved aspects of the show they weren't able to fit in and even tie in tiny details from the comics. It's honestly fun to see the nods to the show we all love. And then they also do some of the most iconic scenes from the show almost exactly one to one (like the Masks episode was perfection).Another gripe I consistently see is from others is on tone and humor. I honestly think this is a very reasonable change that suits the live action format. It's like they made a more realistic version of the original for the now-adult fans to enjoy. The GAang has experienced so much hardship and trauma - and it shows. While I do miss a lot of Aang's bubbly nature, we do still see it peek through and his changes make a lot of sense for a kid who has just lost his entire people. I honestly think it might be a strength of the live action to be able to have that darkness that a kids show for Nickelodeon couldn't.And speaking of characters, the casting for me is fantastic: Sokka is perfect (me literally SCREAMInG at the Sokka-Suki scene - be still my beating heart omg). Zuko is such a perfect angsty teenager, with Azula being acted so well. I love Katara's clear growth over the season and am excited to see these actors, especially the younger actors like Katara and Aang's, settle and grow into their roles in hopefully a second season.Those are just the parts I feel like I need to defend, but the bending and art of the season is absolutely beautiful (even coming from me a CGI hater). The fight scenes are gorgeous and Appa and Momo are utterly adorable. And Hei-Bei?? So well done.Overall, I think it a truly enjoyable show that was made with so much quality and love. Of course I have my small gripes here and there but I don't think that negates the positives of the show. I hope people can watch with open minds and a bit kinder hearts: it may have changes but at its core, it's creating and expanding the atla world in ways we never would have gotten without the show. As a fandom who grew up with the lessons of adaptability and inclusivity from the original show, we should try to love this new version as just that, its own version.I'm utterly excited to rewatch and for a second season!! If you've made it this far, thanks for reading :)","rating":"9\/10","date":"24 February 2024"}
{"title":"Better than Shyamalan's","review":"The effects are great, performances are great, production design (blue screens\/Mandalorian background tech) is great. If you've never watched anything from this IP before, you're sure to have a good time.As a fan of the old series, each character feels very familiar in this adaptation, so for that I praise the casting department. However, I do feel like this series did almost too much fan service. They were too afraid to make any bold new attempts in its storytelling or directorial style. It's all too familiar, making me wonder... why was it rebooted in the first place if they were gonna go this route? It all just feels like the Lion King \"live-action\" film, which also didn't need to be made.All this series did was make me want to rewatch the animated series again, because if the live-action series continues this way, tonally speaking, there's no way it will even attempt to capture the charm and artistry of its predecessor. The original Nickelodeon show has aged all too well for it to warrant a remake, even one as shiny this one.But hey, Netty's version, while lacking substance, is still a good time. Give it a go.","rating":"7\/10","date":"23 February 2024"}
{"title":"Incredible Adaptation","review":"Let's start off with all the criticisms which are unfounded because a live action take on this awesome series will never be like the original show.1.) not enough character development. There are only 8 episodes so they have to leave some things out. They can't fit everything in and they did a great job selecting the elements that they did. There will be more character development as the series progresses. This is season 1\n2.) acting wasn't top tier. No it was not. Though, most of the acting was spot on for the characters. They did a great job of selecting the cast to the best of their abilities. Who else would you cast?Now let's talk about what was right - almost everything.1.) Graphics and animation were amazing.2.) They kept in the most key scenes and the storyline was spot on\n3.) It is much more intense and graphic then the animated series\n4.) They didn't reach or overdue the humor from the original animated series. They kept key jokes and phrases\n5.) The actors played each character well enough or even better than expected.I can keep going about how much they nailed this but see for yourself. If you go in with an open mind and don't nit pick every detail you'll love it. I'm a massive avatar fan and they did this justice.","rating":"10\/10","date":"24 February 2024"}
{"title":"Change isn't always needed","review":"Avatar: The Last Airbender (2024 TV Series) Season 1In this live-action adaptation of the animated series with the same title, we follow Aang, the Avatar tasked with preserving balance between the mortal and spirit realms. His quest for peace involves thwarting the sinister schemes of the Fire Nation.This adaptation endeavors to capture the essence of the animated series while introducing fresh elements and narratives, although achieving perfect balance isn't always attainable.On a positive note, this adaptation dazzles with breathtaking visuals and effects, showcasing a visually stunning world. The fight scenes are meticulously crafted, and although not always showcasing the diverse fighting styles of the animated series, the choreography, and presentation remain commendable.Change is not always accepted, especially when not done well or not being grounded in logical reasoning, and this is probably the biggest problem with this adaptation. The story told here has been reworked. New materials have been added; if stories aren't merged, they're imagined differently, and sometimes some storylines are tossed out. The most egregious is when the new storylines aren't followed through and forgotten. Some of the new materials here are good, for example, the backstory given to Zuko's character, but most will have audiences griping.Another element that sticks out is the portrayal of some characters. Katara here is stripped entirely of the essence she had in the animated series, and calling her a caricature seems like praise. While it's refreshing to see Azula introduced early on, her ruthless and cunning demeanor doesn't fully translate. Zuko's character, on the other hand, receives the most authentic portrayal, capturing all the qualities that made him beloved, and perhaps even enhancing themThere are other minor flaws to note. The choice of wigs for certain characters and how they're installed is poor. Dialogue is poor and sometimes infused with overdrawn expositions. Another gripe here is that it seems like fun has been sucked out of this adaptation, the characters hurry from location to location and ultimately leave comedy on the chopping block.In conclusion, while it may fall short of the masterpiece that is the animated series and evoke constant comparisons, this adaptation represents a positive step forward following the forgettable movie that preceded it.6\/10.","rating":"6\/10","date":"7 March 2024"}
{"title":"Don't believe the negative comments. It's good!","review":"Honestly, they did a solid job with this recreation. Anytime you make a live action from an animation you're going to have critics that only have negative things to say. You're never going to have an exact likeness going from a cartoon to actual people, you can't because it's a cartoon and the characters aren't real. Yet somehow they managed to stick as close to the original as possible and did a very convince job. Book 1 is not my favorite of the Avatar saga, but watching it in live-action was exciting and seeing that they didn't skimp on plot or character development was great. I'm eagerly awaiting Books 2 and 3 and can't wait to see who they cast as Toph. Bring on the metal and blood bending!!!","rating":"8\/10","date":"24 February 2024"}
{"title":"Imagine making a live action \"Speed Racer\"","review":"We all waited for this to come out -- in the light of the 2010 M. Knight Shyamalan version. If you enjoyed the cartoon (albeit, ok, watching it with your kids) -- no live live action production will ever pass muster. Did I enjoy it? Yes. Apart from watching all of the world events unfolding in our day and age, this was a nice escape departure. Not everyone will love or appreciate what it takes to create such production. Imagine re-creating \"Speed Racer\" in live action. You'd hate it, right? Spritle and Chimpkin wouldn't ever be \"funny enough\" or the ubiquitous \"the front circular saws on the Mach-5 can't really cut trees like that\"... The producers knew that risk and ran with it.

{"title":"ATLA Meets the CW","review":"I'm a lifelong ATLA fan - caught a few of these episodes when they dropped in the middle of the night.It's a shame that the M. Night movie set the bar so low for a live-action ATLA adaptation because anything else is bound to look good in comparison. The objective truth is this is a CW-level production - starting with the script.The dialogue is so on the nose, very often cringey, and these actors - main, supporting, and extras - just scream cable TV. I know this is a TV adaptation (steaming), but still, the source material deserves better.I hope I can see ATLA adapted to film one day by a real auteur - like what Denis Villeneuve has done with Dune. There are so many good references for ATLA in film, too: wuxia movies (e.g., Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon), Bertolucci's The Last Emperor, even Martin Scorsese's Kundun.Maybe I'm just disappointed because that's the live-action ATLA I'd like to see - others may enjoy this.","rating":"5\/10","date":"22 February 2024"}
{"title":"Worth a watch","review":"I get why people are upset, but it is getting too much hate. The show has great effects, great acting in its majority, and sticks to the original plot, with some changes here and there. Some things did get rushed and annoyed me, but don't see this as an exact copy of the original animated series, because it is not.Here are my comments:\nLove the costumes and scenary\/green screen,\nBending is done perfectly, except for air bending, feels too fake.I hate the chemistry between Katara and Aang, but Sokka is being portrayed perfectly.They are adding too much things from book 2 and 3 that are not necessary yet.Why add the tunnels part now? And the way that it was done was so bad. They even missed the iconic line on the song.The spirit world part was done very differently. I didn't liked it.We are missing the iconic side quests too like the pirates, Bato, the firemaster, and Aang not learning water bending yet????Character development is too lacking. The bounty hunter, Suki, Kyoshi, Appa, I don't really like Princess Yue here, and even Katara, feels like a background character. Azula also shows up for some reason??But overall, anyone can watch this, it certainly entertains and hopefully gets renewed for book 2 and 3 wich are the best ones.","rating":"7\/10","date":"24 February 2024"}
{"title":"Perfect companion piece to the animated series","review":"I see several negative reviews, mainly from people comparing this new series to the original animated series (let's pretend that horrible motion picture misstep did not occur), but recreating the animated version scene-by-scene in a live action production would be as stupid as recreating Hitchcock's \"Psycho\" scene-by-scene....Oh, wait....someone actually did that, didn't they? And see how well THAT turned out?I greatly enjoyed the original Nickelodeon series, and we have re-watched it many times, so it was with some trepidation that we began watching this series. It quickly became apparent that the people involved with this new series have the same affection for the original as we do. The casting is spot-on (although I do miss Mako's grown as Uncle Iroh), the storyline rings true, the performances are outstanding, and the effects - which bring \"bending\" to life - are fabulous.The only problem: the wait for the next season of episodes. One of my primary gauges of success for a motion picture or a series is whether I am wishing for more at the conclusion (still wishing for a sequel to \"Master And Commander\"!); this first season definitely \"set the hook\" and has us wanting more!","rating":"8\/10","date":"4 March 2024"}
{"title":"Good Special Effects but most of the Actors cannot act","review":"As someone who watched the animated episodes when they dropped week after week and then rewatched them again years later when they came on streaming, I was mostly let down by the series.The Special effects dept and martial arts training team did an excellent job, but like so many recent shows it tries to shoe horn in young Actors who cannot act and who basically just come across as Young LA high school students doing Cosplay.All of the dialog that made the original show funny is gone!All of the character building is gone!The actors come across as though they are being told during filming to smile or look sad or put on a goofy face. Nothing feels natural and nothing makes me feel compelled to like these characters except for the fact that they are playing the parts of my beloved Animate Characters.I will give some props to the Actor who played Sokka. He was the only one that came off as at least trying hard from the start to work with the Humorless material. I did warm up to the Zuko character a bit but the original Zuko voice and characters are so Iconic that it was hard to get use to the new version of him.Most of the older actors were great, I especially felt like I got back the closest version of Iroh that I could hope for.I see no way they can fix this show short of recasting and getting new writers. The recasting part is never going to happen so I think this is going to be a slog fest for Netflix.","rating":"6\/10","date":"4 March 2024"}
{"title":"I need more of this ASAP! LOVED LOVED LOVED","review":"I didn't have high expectations after the 2010 movie adaption but this exceeded all expectations. I was hooked by ep 1. The cast is finally accurate (love the cast), and the visuals are stunning! Everytime a new location is showed I just go \"WOW\"!It's extremely funny and not stiff at ALL. I think the show manages to balance seriousness with comedy amazingly. Sokka and Zuko are hilarious and play their characters so so well. I also love the genuine relationship between Zuko and Iroh. Katara and Aang are just adorable and we love them! Even little side characters like the guys who sing secret tunnel or cabbage guy, it's perfect. I even like how some of the bad guys can still make me laugh. That's when I know something is well written, when bad guys can crack jokes through sarcasm. I can go on and on about the cast and characters, but that would take all day so let me move on.The characters have a lot of depth and it's not just all happy. Some scenes give me chills, tears even.And the story flows along and doesn't feel forced. I watched the cartoon avatar around 2 years ago in 2022 I think, and I've forgotten most of it, but everytime something happens in the live action I am immediately reminded. Each episode contains core story and gives chronological progression accurately. I love small details that reference the cartoon like Aang's air bending move where he floats on a ball and crashes into a rock, Jet with the little stick in his mouth (my sister and I litteraly screamed when that happend).There's not a moment where I feel bored because I love avatar the cartoon and this is it, it's litteraly a perfect live action. This show is really great and out of all the shows I've seen on Netflix, this one has to be in my top 5! Well done guys, can't wait to see more of this. I just know this one took a lot of effort and the cast and crew really outdone themselves.","rating":"10\/10","date":"24 February 2024"}
{"title":"Mixed feelings","review":"I'm only halfway in so my opinion is subject to change, but I'm a big fan of the cartoon.This live action is visually pleasing the action is quite entertaining. I enjoyed the timeline of the first episode. I do not enjoy these mashed up plots that have followed. The dialogue is kind of corny at times which I don't mind so much as I mind the lack of comedy. The couple of times they try to have humor it doesn't land. That being said because of the mashed up plot lines there's details that are missing. I'm enjoying the show but I'd probably love it if they didn't just give us 8 undetailed uncomical episodes I'd happily have taken 20 minute episodes not everything needs to be an hour.Watch it! But if you're a hardcore fan with expectations stemming from the cartoon you'll be disappointed in some way promise.Revisiting this review and adding to it now that I have finished the show out. When I first heard of this live action reboot I heard confirmation the original creators were going to be involved. Turns out they and Netflix parted ways because they weren't seeing eye to eye. It shows, this series compared to an almost 20 yr old cartoon is quite dumbed down and rushed. The only thing this new series has going for it is great action sequences.","rating":"6\/10","date":"26 February 2024"}
{"title":"This is a amazing live action series","review":"I think this series is very good. It is true that this Avatar series has smaller differences compared to the animated series, but the special effects are very good and really great. I am satisfied with the choice they made for acting, but I am happy after watching the first episode. I was hyped and I am very eager for Netflix to continue this series for season 2 and 3\nThe series \"Avatar: The Last Airbender\" attracted me from the very beginning. What a beautiful and exciting world. The actors are great together, the fights look great and the actors are really outstanding. This series is a fun and new take on a classic and enduring work. The scenes using the elements were also shown well.","rating":"10\/10","date":"22 February 2024"}

Well for a very superficial view of the story only otherwise watch the animated show again.So 6\/10 as a standalone show 4\/10 as an avatar show.

Every main character and even some of the secondary characters in the series are pleasant to watch, Every story is well done, Not too heavy, with humor and action in every episode. Not to mention the spectacular landscapes and imaginary cities, the various imaginary creatures and the special effects...After so many disappointments from the fantasy and fantasy TV Series that have been made over the last few years, arrives this diamond of a fantasy TV Series, unlike other heavy, clumsy and mostly boring fantasy TV Series, made in the last years and during the last two decades, It is simply a pleasure to watch it and you don't want it to endA. Not to mention A second season, which is obviously the most requested, and soon please.It is simply an almost perfect fantasy TV Series, because there is no such thing as perfect. But this series, for me at least, has as few disadvantages as possible and as many advantages as possible, and I recommend anyone who likes action and fantasy to watch it. You will have a lot of fun and want more...May all the other creators of fantasy and fantasy TV Series learn from its creators, This is how it is done right, so that your viewers will enjoy watching it and not suffer from it and wish it would end already.Well done!","rating":"9\/10","date":"25 February 2024"}
{"title":"Fair adaptation but does not exceed the childhood magic","review":"Avatar: The Last Airbender Netflix version is a bit of a mixed bag; on one hand it fails to capture the magic of the original series, on the other hand it seems to stay very loyal to the source material from first watch. The best way to look at this show is from an open mind, there is no other way.Let's dive into the world of Avatar by examining pros and cons, we'll focus on the pros first:\nThe visual effects are stunning and look most impressive, same for the entire world and locations created from story board to screen. In general everything that has to do with the surroundings is at a most high level and I appreciate the care for detail.In terms of story, it seems the creators decided to go with a 'Game of Thrones' approach: political games, schemes and backstabbing, wars and careful planning. I for once am in favor of this approach and believe it fits well the world of Avatar (after all, there is war in the show, people die).Zuko's arc is very well crafted, mostly because it is the most interesting of the show (both original and Netflix). From being a banished prince to a man and leader of his own destiny. Dallas Liu portrays him very well and overall it seems he's the only character amongst the others who wasn't harmed by the script.There are other good things to say about the show but for now we'll move to the cons:\nThe biggest problem the show suffers from is that the creators focus mainly on the story and not the characters. In the original series, you had many filler episodes that focused on the dynamics: the episode Tales of Ba Sing Se, when the Gaang get lost in the caves with the group of hippies; Zuko and Azula going on a summer vacation with their friends.You have many examples of character dynamics; Katara and Toph arguing, Zuko and uncle Iroh on the run throughout Book 2. There are Also moments when the characters are just acting silly. I feel all those little dynamics were absent throughout the show it could have added much more depth.Because there were no filler episodes, there was no real chance at diving into the characters, after all Aang, Katara and Sokka are basically kids, so why not show them as kids having fun? ATLA is a show about kids on a journey, about friendship. Imagine the movie 'Stand by me' only at war times.Another big problem the show suffers from is the pacing, this season alone is only 8 episodes, for a show like Avatar it is way too rushed. In one episode alone we were introduced to King Bumi, Jet and The Mechanist. I know Netflix couldn't make a full season of 20 episodes of live action ATLA. It's like demanding a live action version of One Piece with 100 episodes each season - in terms of budget and production it is impossible. Even a 10- or 12- part season would have been fine. I really don't see the reason to rush the story and cut corners.In conclusion, I feel this show overall is a fair adaptation and possibly the best version of ATLA we could have got in live action. If Netflix wants this show to really succeed, they are going to have to put more effort in the script and characters, as of now this series is far from reaching the same level of magic the original show possessed.","rating":"6\/10","date":"8 March 2024"}
{"title":"It's so.... stiff","review":"I went in with an open mind and low expectations... it was pretty disappointing.The bending is better than the movie, but the dialogue and acting style lacks any emotion. Like...any emotion... from any character. It's almost as if they were trying to be more serious, and it just comes off as bored and dull. It's to the point it's cringy and I can't even look.I was waiting for at least someone to shine but I can definitely tell why the original creators left the show now. Aang is so different and the same with Sokka and Zuko too. None of the humor is there from Aang or Sokka and Zuko has 0 anger in his voice.","rating":"2\/10","date":"22 February 2024"}
{"title":"Growth of Characters & Unnecessary changes","review":"To start off, I don't necessarily hate the show. It was created for people who have not watched the original story, that's the vibe I got.One of the things that definitely bothered me was the acting. They should've not rushed the whole production and instead provided these child actors with lessons prior to having them act in a high budget show. They had potential but unfortunately, I guess that did not matter. You would have to hope to see some good acting. I believe only few actors those who were not primarily the main characters, were doing a swell job. For instance, like Bumi - the actor who portrays him is already an established actor, and he did an amazing job.Another unnecessary change was the story of Omashu, now if you watch the original show, it is between a man and women - but here for some reason, it is a story between two women. Priorities, I guess.This show storytelling could've been better, but it explains why the creators left.However, the effects and visual is just incredible! It makes you believe what you see could've actually what the world in Avatar could've been.If I were to say, I think watching the cartoon is definitely way better. However, this is not horrible but also not the best, they could've offered better.","rating":"6\/10","date":"23 February 2024"}
{"title":"A serialized adaptation of a story we love","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed the series and believe that people are overly critical of it. The original cartoon set incredibly high expectations, but it's important to recognize that the cartoon and the current adaptation have different formats. The cartoon was structured in an episodic manner, where each episode could be enjoyed on its own. However, when translating that to a serialized Netflix narrative, it becomes challenging to maintain the same level of childlike charm that some found in Book 1. Despite this, I believe the creators did an excellent job of serializing the story while still incorporating elements from the original cartoon, including some of the filler stories. It's crucial to understand that this is an adaptation of the original story, and as such, there will naturally be narrative differences. Ultimately, it's still Avatar at its core. I encourage you to give it a chance and approach it with an open mind. You'll find numerous instances where they reference other episodes, elements from the comics, and even Korra. Rest assured, the people behind the show are genuine fans themselves.","rating":"10\/10","date":"23 February 2024"}
{"title":"Descent","review":"Let me start off by saying that this is one of the best visually attractive works made by Netflix so if you want to have a good visual experience of a watch then I'd advise you to go give it a watch but that's almost pretty much it. Not a lot I can say really when it comes to the story and characters except for some of the bad guys but other than that, not really interesting catching back stories for each of the \"good guys\" and not really that many details given so you wouldn't really care or feel some kind of attachment to any of them so all in all, it's a descent watch thanks to the gorgeous visual effects that could give you a good experience and lift up some of the boredom.","rating":"6\/10","date":"23 February 2024"}
{"title":"PEOPLE ARE BEING WAY TOO HARSH","review":"The negative reviews make absolutely 0 sense to me whatsoever. I have loved ATLA since I was a kid and I have so far watched almost 3 episodes of this, with no zero expectations. Yes, they changed a few things here and there, and it's much more serious than the animated series - but if they had done everything EXACTLY like in the cartoon, it would've just ended up being cringy and ridiculous. People would've still have complained. I think this has so far done ATLA great justice! The effects are truly amazing, you can just see how much effort they put into the series. Please DON'T let the negative people ruin your experience without giving it a chance!","rating":"10\/10","date":"22 February 2024"}
{"title":"Good. Not perfect, but good.","review":"TLDR: It's good but not perfect, however compared to what we got from M. Night Shyamalan it's a masterpiece.I'm an adult fan of the original series. I didn't \"grow up\" with it, I was already well into adulthood when the animated show came out. I enjoyed it (loved it actually) and it ranks on my all time favorites and I personally am enjoying this adaptation. Compared to M. Night's version though, it's an absolute triumph. THAT version was horrible on every single level in terms of pacing, writing, acting, all of it.This show has its problems but it's not the dumpster fire other reviews are making out to be. The writing is a little on the nose but it's not horrible. I also see other complaints about the lack of humor, changes in characterizations etc but the changes are not the end of the world IMO.Yes, changes have been made to characters and plot points and while some of them I may not have agreed with at first, I feel the show does a good in-universe justification for them and I did get on board with the changes eventually.If you were a childhood super fan who grew up with this or are expecting a shot for shot recreation from the animated series to live action, then I can see how this adaptation is disappointing. If you have an open mind and are ok with them keeping the \"spirit\" of the original animated series despite the changes then you'll be fine. Again, it's not perfect. . . But compared to what we got in 2010. . . .it's a masterpiece.Finally. Iroh is still iroh. Love him in this.","rating":"7\/10","date":"22 February 2024"}
{"title":"I absolutely loved it","review":"For the amount of episodes they had been given, they truly did the best they could, some of the characters are spot on and their inexperience truly add value to the series. Which is amazing.The visuals are beyond. I am a fan of king Bumi now especially because he was played masterfully. I love that we got some awnsers that we haven't seen in the original series as well.I do however need to get over the the aesthetics of the firenation a litle. In the original they look quite a bit different because sunburn and such doesn't effect them. So i feel they missed the mark on their native aesthetics which is a bit of a shame. But besides that detail, i do think Zuko's mannerisms and voice are spot on. So well done.In the original series the firelord and azula are a lot more malicious (like hannibal silence of the lambs kind of vibes). But here they decided to make them a bit softer, almost more relatable. Which make them lose their wicked kind of charm.Hopefully they will get there in the following seasons!Even tho i do have some thoughts about it.I still give the series a 10!Like i said i feel like they tried to put an aweful lot of imported puzzlepieces vital to the series in that short amount of episodes and still find ways to tribute legendary moments from the original series to the main storyline,as well be a show on its own.I don't think they could have done much better!","rating":"10\/10","date":"24 February 2024"}
{"title":"It's not terrible, chill out.","review":"The reviews saying this is comparable to the movie are a bit dramatic.So far it is good and as an obsessed fan of the original I think they did the show justice in some aspects. I think the adaptations of the storyline are nice. I don't want to watch a minute by minute replica of the original show. I want to see a new perspective which I think they've done a fair job at. The chemistry of the cast is what is just making it a bit tough to watch. There is absolutely nothing for the dynamic of the group. Whether that come from the atrocious acting or just too many story lines I am not sure. They also introduced characters that I think should've been held off until the second season. It just seems overcrowded. I like the dynamic and sass of Sokka. I think he was casted well and does a fair job at representing the original character. The other two are not memorable. Zuko is what was expected. Iroh does a great job so far. I'm a bit disappointed on Azula being introduced so early on. Although Azula is probably my favorite character of the series, bringing her in so early sort of upstages the hardships Zuko has to face and his future character development.I would hope that it gets renewed for a second season, but won't be entirely hurt if it doesn't at this point. Though comparing it to that atrocity of a movie 10+ years ago is just not fair. That was unwatchable. They did fine.","rating":"7\/10","date":"22 February 2024"}

{"title":"Didn't see the need for it to get a live action adaptation. Still don't.","review":"I mean, the show is good enough. It doesn't fail it's fans, sticks to the main story line and at least tries to recreate the charm of the animated version. However, there is a reason why certain stories better translate through animation and not live action. It's about the suspension of disbelief.Most of the characters come across more like cosplayers, look very distinct from another, each having their defining features much like animated characters would. But in real life it just looks cheap, too pretty. The characters don't feel like lived characters, if that makes sense.The dialogue can also be very stiff and stale. Sometimes the effects look rather cheap, but I don't really mind. It is only minor things. When the big fights happen and bending is involved, the effects look really good. Also really brutal (esp. During the air temple attack and that one scene in the fire lord's throne room).I also found most of the actors did a good job: Iroh, Zuko, Suki, Azula. I also found myself chuckle at times when Sokka had some one-liners, but overall, the acting is... meh.I think it is impossible to view this show apart from the animated series and the live action movie that shall not be named. Compared to the latter it is liquid gold, but next to the original series it kinda just comes across like a fan made project with a big budget.Still, it was respectful of the fans, shortened or combined the story beats but stuck to the main ones. It doesn't disappoint, but also doesn't prove why it should exist at all.I don't want to come across as someone who hates this show. I don't. But if I were to decide between rewatching this or the animated version, I will always pick the animated version.","rating":"6\/10","date":"25 February 2024"}
{"title":"IT WAS PAINFUL TO WATCH","review":"The script and the acting is literally so bad you might wanna puke. Like you can tell theyre trying to act, especially that Katara girl.The script is horrible and cringe. No character development, theres no humour whatsoever and story is a bit rushed.Is it better than the movie ? Maybe.Is it a good series to watch ? I dont think soI think the director miscast a lot of roles here. The only decent actor here is that Zuko guyWell, i think netflix should stop making a careless anime adaptation like this because for ATLA fans its literally their childhood.It was painful to watch\nIt really was.","rating":"2\/10","date":"22 February 2024"}
{"title":"Worst than the movie","review":"I am so surprised seeing people gives high marks to this series which is much less than the movie that got a 4. I truly loved the movie, the actors played much better, the music was much better.Sometimes, I am amazed by how viewers judge the movies or series that even had a long tenured success.In this series, even the boy that plays the Avatar is not charismatic at all, I am not convinced by his playing. The only character I liked was Katara's.The dialogues like the spirit, it is so boring sometimes. It was so hard for me to continue watching episode by episode. I resisted only because I wanted to be able to leave a fair review and make justice to the movie.","rating":"6\/10","date":"24 February 2024"}
{"title":"The ATLA Universe is expanded, deepened, and enriched","review":"This adaptation was mostly good, but cheap in the wrong places. As a self-proclaimed lifelong die-hard fan, I went into this not at all wanting to draw comparisons. Knowing Michael Dante DiMartino and Bryan Konietzko left the production over creative differences, I embraced this as its own interpretation.With that, I'm left a bit bittersweet for what's lacking, but also awestruck at what was accomplished visually. My biggest gripes come down to this:1. The 'just a kid but also the world's savior' factor is downplayed. Aang is twelve in both the animated and live action series. Yet, in the animated version it's very obvious he's 12. He's fun loving, adventurous, and optimistic - despite learning and experiencing many hard truths all at once. In the live-action, from the get-go, Gordon Cormier plays a very serious Aang. Don't get me wrong, the animated character is totally leveled by an air of seriousness during climactic events in the Nickelodeon series, but he definitely has an airy, lifting spirit as well. This was the major lacking element for me overall, as someone who related to that personality type, but I can see how this may have been produced to match the live-action's overall serious mood and theme. I don't know that they had to lean into the seriousness of it all as much, but they did. In defense of Gordon, he played the seriousness so well! And his emotional acting throughout, especially in the beginning, really portrayed the loss of a nation, the loss of part of his soul. I can't wait to see him grow through the entire series!2. Flat girl characters. Sorry, not sorry, but I need more fierceness, more nerve from the live-action girlies. Again, the overall serious tone of the Netflix version really pigeonholed a lot of the narrative and character developments. We don't see a lot of hills and valleys at all. I understand the limit of eight episodes in under an hour each, but the lack of well-rounded and *ahem* balanced personalities, is killing me. Early on, Katara was a young girl venturing out into a big world unknown. But she had innate grit and ironically, fiery passion. She would always keep the boys in order and the team together by any means. I realize she got fiercer in the last episode, but she was a force way before then. Same goes for Azula. I have less to say because she was hardly in Book One, so the live-action storyline provides us more background, really. However, I really hope she amps up the twisted and, frankly, psychotic nature that is so iconically Azula. Of course, again, hills and valleys. She's not always crazy, but she is always evil.3. The storyline is a bullet train on acid. Let me first say, I appreciate that they were able to incorporate so many different, iconic parts. From Jet and the Freedom Fighters, to the Kyoshi Warriors and the Spirit World, and the traumas of all the main characters. It. Was. Just. A. Lot. I think that if I hadn't watched the show or been familiar, I would have no clue of what is going on in the live-action. Again, I like that they included so much, but it definitely caused the storytelling to suffer. I don't believe it's clear that Aang has the smallest window to save the world, or that he's about to embark on a journey of learning all the elements in order to do so. Additionally, there is so much time invested in revisiting past trauma. I get it, it adds depth and background and motive for what's currently happening - but it makes the overall mood heavy. We frequently transition from trauma to conflict to sadness to seriousness to inspiration. It just makes the lack of comedy and relief so stark. I'm not saying they shouldn't have included their trauma, because it's certainly integral, I just wish it was balanced with the comedic relief it called for. Too much wah. Not enough haha.And that's it for gripes! What I loved:1. The incredible world building. In every scene, every nation, every episode, I was simply amazed. I think a big pull for any ATLA fan is the world building. Literally every few minutes I would scream, \"The budget is budgeting!\" It was especially nice to get a glimpse of the Southern Air Temple before its destruction. Those scenes alone added so much depth to the ATLA universe and more value to the visual picture of Air Nomads. Even the costuming of the people of different nations is so rich and a really aesthetic appeal that is simply cinematically pleasing.2. The unexpected changes. Of course I missed the part where Aang meets Roku during the solstice and Roku unleashes his spirit fire power on the haters outside. But I feel like Aang's meeting with Kyoshi and her unleashing her power on the haters at the village - more or less - was an adaptation of that scene. I can appreciate it for maintaining how important it was for Aang to make that first connection with a past life in order to be routed to the North Pole. I appreciate it more for adding depth to Kyoshi and showing just how much of a badass fighter she was. Same goes for Omashu mashup. From the secret tunnel crew to Bumi's challenges and incorporating the Air acolytes, I thought it squeezed a lot into a little rather well. Again, it was a lot of whiplash moving between so many iconic scenes and connecting the dots while drawing new ones. But I appreciate how much they made it work.3. The bending is mostly unflappable. The only bending that had me smirking was when Kyoshi fully went Captain Marvel and rocketed into the sky and back to the ground like a comet. I don't doubt the Avatar has that kind of power, but it was pretty startling to see. Otherwise, I thought the bending across all the elements was wonderful! I'm also glad we saw a decent range of moves and maneuvers.Overall, my inner child is very happy with the live-action. I was 9-12 years old when the animated version aired in 2005-2008. To be 27 years old today and watching this complete elevation and transformation of the show is literally the most exciting thing for me in a while. I have my opinions and criticisms, but as Master Pakku said, \"Change is the key to new life.\" I love the animated original and I love this live-action version. The ATLA universe is expanded, deepened, and enriched by all those that made each series possible - and for that I'm grateful.","rating":"8\/10","date":"24 February 2024"}
{"title":"Better than the movie, worse than the animated series","review":"Vfx: Pointing out the obvious the animations look mostly great. I feel like fighting scenes are often too closely shot, which sometimes gives me a claustrophobic feeling and missing some of the bending action. Also with earth and air, its a lot of dust, but maybe thats just my opinion or a way for them to cover stuff, but could be less dust. Water is dripping a bit much imo too. But thats really my opinion and criticism on a high notch.Acting: It feels flat. Sometimes not enough emotions, and then way too much in the next cut. I dont wanna blame the actors tho. Cast was mostly fine, but I didnt vibe with Tai Lee, Mai and Azula. But lets give them time. BUT why azulas fire was red, is weird. But maybe they will work on a story line there. Dialogs feels flat too.Story: Its all over the place. Jumping between story lines a lot, getting confused, and also putting some 2nd book storys in the first book. Maybe they wanna mix things up, but didnt work in my opinion. Generally the approach at first seemed more serious, with showing the attack on the fire nation where people were burned alive, pretty intense, but then forcing in some comedic elements which just dont land. Delivery also lacking. I guess it would make sense to mix it up a bit, since a 1 on 1 copy would have been a bit boring.All in all its a nice attempt with many flaws. The good thing tho, they are all fixable. So hopefully it gets renewed for a second season where we can see improvements.","rating":"6\/10","date":"24 February 2024"}
{"title":"Not perfect but a great series none the less","review":"Recap. This series has always had high expectations and even higher apprehention. Music and graphics are tight. Even these 1 star reviews can't deny that.Ep1 was a little iffy. I was unsure abt the acting. Everything seemed a bit staged and stiff. I couldn't concentrate on the storyline and as a big Aang gang fan I was worried. As the episodes progressed they got better and better. By ep4 they had me in happy tears. I give this show an 8\/10. Good job guys. I love it.Nothing is as ever as good as the original, and with such devoted fans this series will always been impossible under such heavy weight. Y'all did great.","rating":"8\/10","date":"24 February 2024"}
{"title":"meh. Leaving too much out trying to fit too much in","review":"We can now do what used to only be able to be done in cartoons. This is okay, but it's a long way from the show we fell in love with decades ago. The cast tries and if we hadn't seen ATLA & KORRA it would be okay. But the humor is absent, in addition to the whole thing just being chaotic and frenetic and disorganized. Skimming the best bits from a few episodes and trying to make the whole thing work just makes nothing work.On the positive side, I believe Mako is smiling and nodding in approval at Paul Sun-Hyung Lee's performance.By and large the show is just another lackluster, ho hum reimagining.","rating":"6\/10","date":"29 February 2024"}
{"title":"Finally a remake done well!","review":"\"Avatar: The Last Airbender\" season 1 (2024) is a beautiful live action adaptation of the animated \"Avatar: The Last Airbender\" (2005). Of course only season one has been remade and it is gonna be a while for season 2 of 3.The casting can be compared to the casting of \"Stranger Things\" (2016). An all young cast with upcoming actors who will be in the hands of Netflix for the foreseeable future. I myself have little to no comments on the cast, they are all doing an incredible job and i can't wait to see more of them on my screen.It has always been hard to remake an already beloved show that barely has any flaws, they tried to do this with \"The Last Airbender\" (2010) but this was a big flop and did not do well. I am really glad they did not give up on doing this and tried again. They just did so much better this time around.Everything looked really well done, the visual and practical effects were amazing and they really brought the world of Avatar: the last airbender alive.One of my favorite things about this show was the music. Takeshi Furukawa did such an amazing job, using little bits and pieces from the original show it brought tears to my eyes sometimes. The goosebumps were constant for me while watching this.I cannot wait for the seasons to come and look forward to it so much!Good job Netflix!","rating":"8\/10","date":"27 February 2024"}
{"title":"Quite disappointing","review":"This series is much much worse than the 2010 movie. Netflix had 8 hours to tell the same story and it managed to screw up. I feel like the movie brought more information in only 2 hours. Without mentioning better actors, dialogue and plot. It is quite impressive how little Netflix can do with so much money. And once again the viewers will have to wait god-knows-how-many years for the continuation. Every time I watch a Netflix series I feel like I'm being pranked, they keep me watching without ever bringing the show to an end. Pretty disappointing. It is worth watching, it is a great story. But don't buy into the 10\/10 reviews, it is very very far from a 10.","rating":"7\/10","date":"29 February 2024"}
{"title":"Avatar: The Last Airbender (Season 1) - 8.7\/10","review":"1. Overall Plot - 9\/10\nThe overall plot is pretty much the same from the cartoon. Little story details get changed or moved around, but nothing in a way that ruins it. It is all still very good.They don't mention sozins comet as the time frame for the show like the cartoon does. This is because they have to account for the actors aging. So it's OK because there is a legit reason to do it.2. Entertainment \/ Engagement - 9\/10\nThe whole show is very entertaining. The first episode is a bit boring and cheesy. But with every episode it just gets better and better.Because it's the same overall story, so you know the outcome, but some of the details are changed, it's still engaging to watch, because it's still something new and fresh.3. Emotion \/ Investment in Story - 8\/10\nZuko carries the emotion in this. His development, and how we learn and sympathize with his character is so good. They did a great job bringing his character into live action.Other characters do a good job showing their emotions, but nothing really makes you feel to much for them as much as Zuko.Because of the things they change, it keeps you heavily invested, even knowing the outcome. Which I thing is great to keep people watching and wanting more.4. Theme and Depth of Story - 9\/10\nI'd say the theme of this season is determination and accepting who you are. We see this with almost all the main characters as they develop.This story is super deep. Especially with Zuko. There is a lot to learn, and I'm excited about the future seasons.5. Characters - 8\/10\nThey nailed most of the characters. Something to keep in mind with the characters is that this live action version isn't a kids show like the cartoon, so the characters are gonna inevitably be a little different. Azula was introduced early on in the season and plays a small part in the plot. This is a change from the cartoon, as she didn't appear until the last episode of the season. But I think they did a good job with it.There's really only three problems I have with the characters. The first is Sokka. His character is by far the most different. He is a lot more serious, and makes a ton less jokes. But that is also part of it not being a kids show so I don't think it's terrible. And he still has his Sokka moments. I also wish he used his boomerang more since it's part of his iconic character.The next is Admiral \/ Commander Zhao. His character is completely different. I think it's just the way the actor plays it, but he has a completely different demeanor to him. It is also changed a bit because he works with Azula, which doesn't happen in the cartoon. Keep in mind, that just because his character is changed a bit, doesn't mean it is bad. I still enjoyed it.The third change I noticed was pretty small. It's with Aang. He spends most of the season not wanting to accept that he's the Avatar, or complaining that he failed ad the Avatar. While in the cartoon he just gets over it a lot sooner.6. Acting \/ Writing - 6\/10\nMost the actors do good, but not great. They don't do anything bad, but just don't do anything spectacular either.I actually think Zuko's actor nailed him. It might seem like he complains and whines too much, but that is how Zuko started out. He is just a moody teenager after all.All the writing was pretty good. There was a few cringy and cheesy parts, but that was really only in the first few episodes.7a. Cinematography - 4\/10\nThe usual Netflix cinematography. They just make everything so dark and grainy. And I hate that. Some scenes look to bland, while others look to busy as well.The characters outfits look too new as well. Sometimes they just look out of place and too cartoony for the vibe of the show.7b. Choreography - 10\/10\nI'm adding this as a separate section because of how good it was. All of the bending looks freakin sick. I think they made it look as good as it can get. Especially when compared to the crappy bending in the movie.8. Score - 9\/10\nI love how they brought a lot of the original music back. The score of the cartoon is perfect and amazing. I just wish they used it a little bit more, and less of the new music. The new music is still good though.9. Editing \/ Pace - 9\/10\nThey did a great job editing this. All of the fights are edited good, and feel intense. There is also some very cool transitional shots that I loved.The pace is also very great. Because it's a live action, you cannot pace it the same as a cartoon. It just doesn't work. But they didn't cut anything you wouldn't want them too. This show feels like it was made by people who love the cartoon. So the pacing is great.10. VFX\/Practical Effects - 8\/10\nAll of the special effects are super good. All of the bending looks super real and cool.The only thing that is noticeably bad is when Aang is in the Avatar State. They do some closeup shots of his face, and the CGI looks bad. It honestly looks like a videogame cutscene. But that's because it's a Netflix show, so it doesn't have the highest budget ever.Average Score:\n8.1\/10My Overall Rating and Final Thoughts:\n8.7\/10\nI actually really liked this show. I think they did a good job of remaking it. If you think of it as a live action version of the cartoon, it's going to suck, and you'll hate it. But if you think of it as a fan that remade the series using all the same plot points and details in live action, then it is great. I am fine with how it is changed and in a bit of a different order from the original. At first I didn't like it, but then it got better. Episodes 4, 5, and 6 are so freakin good. If you like the cartoon then definitely give this a watch. Just have an open mind about it, because nothing will ever be as good as the original. And even if you don't like it at first, keep watching. It gets so much better.","rating":"9\/10","date":"24 February 2024"}
{"title":"Excited and disappointed at the same time.","review":"I'm excited for the series and the visuals were great. The story line although some changes from the animation was much closer and more enjoyable than the movie. But its just that if there wasn't the terrible movie to compare it to than this series would have been ranked lower for me. The acting and casting just missed the mark. Seemed like none of the actors were fans of the series and just learning the script for the first time. Everything seemed so robotic and all the fun and comedic feel was removed. Honestly the character choice for pretty much everyone just seemed off no one really felt like they fit the role they were playing. Which the exception of Fire Lord Ozai he was casted well. But Zuko and Azula were totally disappointing. I think of your a fan its still worth watching it will most likely be the best live action version we get but. Don't get your expectations up to high.","rating":"6\/10","date":"23 February 2024"}
{"title":"Watered down and simplified","review":"This adaptation has no resemblance with the original in any shape or form if you look at it from the story. It is so simplified and lacks any depth that it doesnt convey the multifaceted messages the original conveyed perfectly. It begs the question as to why would any sane person do this? They somehow thought the idea of taking 4-5 Episodes from the original from different seasons and different locations and put it in blender and just mix it into a mush that has no quality left at all. Also the acting is really bad because they cant act the way the characters are and have totally different personalities. The only good are the animals and locations like Omashu. As a fan i am deeply dissapointed and can completely understand why the Original Writers dont want anything to do with this. Clearly Netflix doesnt care. I just cant wrap my head around how this is popular. After watching this insult i had to watch the original to not explode from pure shock.","rating":"2\/10","date":"12 March 2024"}
{"title":"Incredibly flawed but better than the 2010 movie","review":"Its not very good but not the worst. The main issue was the dialogue felt forced and unnatural due to over exposition. This was the same problem as the 2010 movie and overall made most scenes a hard watch. Some positives would be the visuals as the costume and set design was impeccable. The world felt alive and they did a good job bringing the locations from the animated series to life. The directing and cinematography was also good however it felt very safe and was not inventive hence it did nothing out of the ordinary. Another flaw would be the pacing as it felt too rushed at times especially when getting to the north. In the animated series, the side stories helped with character development and that was lacking severely in the adaptation.","rating":"7\/10","date":"22 February 2024"}
{"title":"A brilliant ADAPTATION!! wasted on negative reviewers","review":"Geez, reading some of these negative reviews makes you think whether they have bothered to watched the Netflix series at all. The visual was amazing, the casting was almost spot on with a couple of exceptions, but overall, really really pleased and loved every moment of this adaptation. If you want to watch a like for like, then just watch the original animation instead.This series really captures the essence of the original animation - friendship, humour and how each character develops over time. There are true moments that brings tears to my eyes. Highly rate Aang and Zuko as the 2 best characters and their acting so far.Enjoy this with open mind instead and ignore the negative reviews. You can give these people a gold bar and they'll still think it's worthless.Cannot wait for Book 2, in the meantime, I'll rewatch again as I binged all 8 episodes in 1 go and may have missed some of the details.******* UpdateOmg!! Some 1 star ratings because they saw the trailer and the skin tone of Sokka and Katara were too pale and not enough diversity, so they decided to give the low rating without even bothered watching the series, this is just another level of ignorance and says it all. They are certainly open to their opinions, but it's like having a sniff of your food without tasting it and just throw it away, unbelievable.","rating":"10\/10","date":"22 February 2024"}
{"title":"Poor enunciation, bad acting, dull.","review":"I couldn't understand what most of the leading children were saying. Every line was delivered at a rapid clipped pace. Katara, aang, even kyoshi... Blurred dialogue delivery made the whole thing feel very amateurish. I needed subtitles to understand most of what was being said. Strangely, the subtitles added spaces between words that the actors did not provide. Lots of cringe. Zero fun. Also, I sat through 2 hours of this and didn't even chuckle once. Every element was rushed, the humor of the original was removed, and this live-action's reliance on amateurish live actors was a poor choice, given the talent of the chosen actors.","rating":"","date":"27 February 2024"}
{"title":"A missed opportunity to turn greatness into a masterpiece","review":"It was ten times better than the previous hot pile of garbage, but the writing could have been better.I feel the writers tried including what they deemed the \"key\" elements of ATLA, but they missed sight of crucial character and plot development that was subtle in the original production.I wasn't confused for someone who has watched the original series and knows the lore, but for someone who hasn't watched the original series, they'd be super confused. Things like how Katara's bending drastically improved, Aang and the Avatar gang's relationships, and Zuko and his dilemma between capturing the Avatar and wanting to please his father are all essential arcs in the original production that tied together to make an excellent series. I'm assuming the directors were given a time limit for the entire season and, hence, had to cut off parts, but this is where I feel they missed.They cut off parts from the original series at the cost of the characters' overall development and plot.Special effects and bending were out of this world. The music and editing were excellent. I'd give it between a 3.7 and 4 out of 5. It wasn't a remake that made my jaw drop, but it was a job well done.","rating":"7\/10","date":"23 February 2024"}
{"title":"Loved the big budget and casting but where is the ang's comical presence.","review":"Just finished binge watching the tv series. It had the big budget and production as i expected and it was one of the best and i think they tried to make their own vision of the series come to life but my big fat question to the creator is that why deviate from the source material at all. You could have met with a great review if you had just sticked to the script . I mean where is the ang's funniness and comical presence that he had shown from the very first scene when he said to katara that ' would you go to penguin sailing with me ' and in the very next episode he just did with katara. Where is the saka's goofied mixed reply whenever he was in scene in the anime . Where are the mini adventures that were unrelated to the mission at all. I mean you literally had a video script for this . I am happpy to have got the live action version but please and please try to stick to the anime script. Just to make myself happy and wash down the little disappointment from this series you made me again binge watch the anime version.","rating":"8\/10","date":"23 February 2024"}
{"title":"Did enjoy, but not as much as I hoped","review":"First, don't expect the cartoon show... it's close but not that close... you will be disappointed if you except the cartoon version. There was some aspects I liked that they added, but there are some I didn't... for example:The attack on the north was just a distraction... what we really were after was omashu.Distraction... Distracting who? Boomy knew knew they were coming and even told Aang and the gang. The northern watertribe don't leave their border... so distracting who?If this has you confused, you are in for some writing that makes no sense.Some* writing.Acting on Aang's & Katara's acting aren't great... especially Katara she definitely needs to grow as an actress.The graphics are good... except the air bending. Sokka wasn't bad, I hoped he'd be funnier, but was at least was at times. Aang blames himself for everything constantly whether or not it's his fault. Like everyone told him the northern watertribe was going to be destroyed, but the ending outcome was up to him... so when the city was destroyed... he blamed himself despite his vision, keoshi, Roku, and the water Avatar (forgot his name), telling him thus was going to happen, but the ending outcome was going to be up to him. Katara is a Mary Su & is already a master before even being taught anything and also never learned healing. Now the worst thing about the show is that Aang never even bothered to learn any water bending... or any bending at all. Like all 8 episodes just watched Katara learn by herself.Now... everything I did enjoy.Casting, everyone looks exactly like the show. Beautiful. The acting and story with Zuko & Iroh are great! They did them so well. His sister had more involvement which was done well. Commander Zhao was awesome, they did him very well. The side actors were great. The episode blending was done well. I like how the beginning of episode one felt like Star Wars: Revenge of the Sith... that was really nice. Overall, it was a 7\/10 for me, and would be a little upset to see what they will do with a season 2 learning from their mistakes.","rating":"7\/10","date":"23 February 2024"}
{"title":"Whats not to like?","review":"I literally loved everything about this series. I know people are loyal to the cartoon and had their fingers burnt by the awful film, but this is definitely not that. It is engaging, funny and told excellently. I would highly recommend this to all viewers!If I had one criticism I would say it falls off a bit halfway through, with a couple of episodes feeling a bit like 'filler episodes' but this is quickly forgotten when the action begins.I think people who loved the original are a bit closed minded to these things but truthfully this is a good series which could be enjoyed by all if the fans of the original could just get over it haha.","rating":"10\/10","date":"26 February 2024"}
{"title":"6\/10 for sheer lack of self awareness","review":"First, the positives: visually stunning and mostly true to the source material. While they did rework some of the stories from the animated series, this was usually well done and I am happy with the changes. The bending is visually appealing and the set locations are stunning.Then the negatives: the dialogue consists of cringy \"deep and meaningful\" conversations sprinkled with the occasional quip. The director definitely went the way of a tell don't show approach to character development that was tired and plain annoying by the end. Let's not get started about the acting.That all said, I hope that they continue with season 2 and work to improve the show. The groundwork is there, all they need to do is build better.","rating":"6\/10","date":"28 March 2024"}
{"title":"Amazing","review":"The first 30 minutes were hard to get into. After that the show really takes off. They cast characters that really look like the characters from the original show. I loved everything about it and I'm blown away by the negativity. They absolutely KILLED this remake and I hope they make more. Sakka and Ang both look exactly like his anime character, down to the expressions on Sakkas forehead. The bad guys uncle was also perfectly cast. I've been waiting my whole life for a good remake of this show and I think Netflix really delivered. This was definitely tailored to the people who grew up watching and loving the original show.","rating":"10\/10","date":"24 February 2024"}
{"title":"It's OK","review":"I started watching the show made it to episode 4 and lost interest. They did couple of things right, I thought the cgi was good enough and Sokka's portrayal was pretty decent, Zuko's as well. I don't think this show is terrible it's just that there is a better version of this wich is the original animated show. There are some things that bothered me like I don't understand why they made katara so bland and emotionless her expressions were just not there, maybe the actress for katara was miss casted. There is also lot of exposition wich gets pretty annoying. In conclusion, some people might enjoy this version but It's not for me and if you haven't seen the animated show I strongly suggest that you watch that.","rating":"6\/10","date":"1 March 2024"}
{"title":"Definitely way below my expectation","review":"Probably my expectation is too high. Everything is just so messy here and there. The special effect is not clean, it is not good at all . The music score is boring, sometimes the melody doesnt match the scene and it is kinda distracting. The script is not the best. The sound is not good.However my biggest problem is the cast choice and their acting performance. Gordon is okay as Aang, Ian is also okay as Sokka. I think the director miscast Katara and Zuko, I do not feel their character's energy, their face expressions are so blandThe only saving grace of this live action series is the acting performance from the senior actors & actresses.","rating":"3\/10","date":"22 February 2024"}
{"title":"Not the original, but not bad","review":"It's not the original. Get that in your mind to start. But for live action, it's certainly magnitudes better than M. Night Shamalayn's take on the franchise. The acting and story are definitely better, as is the casting. These characters actually feel like moderate reflections of the characters in the show, although admittedly a lot of the show was rushed. The original 1st season is 20+ episodes that are around 20 minutes a piece while this new series is only 8 episodes around an hour each. They should have let it have more episodes to show how these characters develop and react to the situations theyre facing as they travel. Also, some of the season 2 arcs were implemented into this season, such as Azula's training, the \"Secret Tunnels,\" and the end of the series where we see Bumi and Omashu defeated by the Fire Nation. I'm guessing this was done because they wanted to do it in case they didn't get a season 2, but it does show lack of faith in their project.At the very least the casting was good and they managed to weave together multiple episodes and stories together in a way that felt moderately cohesive. Honestly it feels like what we got in the original was the glamourous tale of Team Avatar's exploits, the legend and myths of their travels, and this felt like what actually happened in their stories. In this case, the original show is more entertaining because so many of the stories have been written that way, while I feel like this series is a detailed description and recreation of the events that took place, which means that ofc its not going to be as good as the larger than life stories we've gotten before, but certainly still interesting.For an Avatar remake? Not bad. As a show? It's pretty good, but the original is still a ton better. I'd say if you're looking for a decent summary of what happens in book 1 of the original series, this isn't a bad choice.","rating":"6\/10","date":"26 February 2024"}
{"title":"Amazing!","review":"This is a brilliant adaptation of the original animated series, it stayed true to the animation but also put a new twist to it. Yes it's not perfect but I don't think anyone can expect perfection, you can see the effort the people working on the show have put into it and most of the time I can respect the work they have done. The bending looks beautiful and some of the fight scenes were even better than in the animation, the story line works and sets season 2 up perfectly. It's not as good as the animation but nobody excepted that anyway, this show deserves so much credit for bringing a beloved show to life. Some of the hate on this show is ridiculous, Avatar is not for everyone but I love it and a lot of people can agree with me. I really hope this show does well and I hope we get a season 2 because all the true Avatar fans deserve it.","rating":"9\/10","date":"23 February 2024"}
{"title":"Take the good with the bad","review":"There's a lot to love of this series. Combining book one is okay by me since there was a lot in the animated series that they had to stretch to make a show. However it should've been at least 13 so it didn't have to be so rushed. I adore Zuko and Irohs character and their relationship. Everything about those two and their stories was done right and better. Sokka was just right. Btw, he's a mini Sam from Supernatural, now you can't unsee it! I'm sorry but Kataras character is so much more emotionless that when it came to \"girls can't fight\" scene, she should've been so angry, go after him right then and there to challenge the master. I cannot believe I miss the animated Katara. Bumi was so resentful that it was off putting. I honestly do not like the way they wrote Azusa's character; we don't have to see the unsure parts of her story, it's a waste. Yue's way of going into the spirit world is incorrect. And why change the Two Lovers, it's unnecessary. Everyone blaming the avatar for not being there for them for 100 years was actually so annoying. Aang could've been more goofy and yet people around him kept putting him down. So much shame and guilt and resentment. This show is also not meant for little kiddos like the animation. And I mean it when I say, Too. Much. Dialogue! So much repeating the same type of lines over and over again. They needed both creators to have made it more successful.","rating":"6\/10","date":"25 February 2024"}
{"title":"It's No Cartoon, But That Works Really Well","review":"This is actually a fairly decent series; I had never seen the animated series I'd enjoy it more. The acting is pretty good, and the writing is decent. There are some minor issues with the FX, but I'm emphasizing \"minor\"; I would have liked more practical effects but then Katara would have been shortchanged.While this is below the cartoon, it's well above the movie on every level. If you're looking for something to binge, it works, especially if you have kids.There are three basic issues, but I'm throwing in the caveat that this is just the first season, so I'm expecting some issues.1) It's trying too hard to follow the series. This isn't necessarily a bad thing, but it can actually get annoying every so often. However, it does deviate from the path and fills things in with just enough frequency to make it interesting.2) The storytelling feels too linear: It just doesn't flow like it should, and there should be more flashbacks, and the flashbacks that are there are just too brief. This is more of a personal preference, but this is one story that needs those eddies and vortices.This also applies to the introduction of Azula and Co. However, I do like her introduction this early into the series, and letting her develop a little more than she was allowed to in the series. It's also nice to her evilness develop.3) The character development is a little slow, but it is again the first season; let's establish the basics first. However, I do like what they are doing with Osai; it makes him a better villain when you can see the development of his villainy contrasted with how good of a father he is.Like I said: This is actually a fairly decent series, and it can work outside of the original series. It's well worth watching, even if you are a hardcore fan of the cartoon.","rating":"8\/10","date":"2 March 2024"}
{"title":"Not quite it","review":"For a show called Avatar: The Last Airbender, Katara feels more like the main character rather than Aang. Also, this season is meant to be Aang learning water bending but he doesn't even try to learn it the entire season, making him pretty useless. Very weird.Anyway, they removed so many important plot points such as Aang learning about the comet from Roku which kickstarts the whole show giving him a time limit to learn all the elements, it just doesn't happen. Finally an episode combines 3 stories into one (the panda, frogs and blue spirit, and visiting Rokus island) and it all feels very rushed.It's still enjoyable but it's not good. Just an okay show.","rating":"6\/10","date":"27 February 2024"}
{"title":"CAN'T WAIT FOR ANTOHER BOOK STORIES!!!","review":"Everything is good, although there are still some things that I feel are not quite right, such as the players who play Azula, Mai, and Ty Lee look like middle school students who like to gossip. There are several scenes that in the animation look important but in the live action version they appear, such as when Aang first became an avatar in the water and when Aang went to the Avatar Roku temple and told the world that the avatar had returned as a form of hope for peace, I also really liked it. Suki's character has good chemistry with Sokka and can't wait to see him again in the next story. Hopefully this live action version of Avatar TLA will be even better in the next story.\uf8ff\u00fc\u00e5\u00e4\uf8ff\u00fc\u00e5\u00e8\uf8ff\u00fc\u00ee\u2022\uf8ff\u00fc\u00ed\u00ae","rating":"10\/10","date":"24 February 2024"}
{"title":"Excellent graphics, Decent performance maybe script could be better","review":"Agree with some reviews and don't agree with some. Any adaptation of this nature is difficult and this is not the best by far but definitely good and decent. Strangely I got connected to the antagonists more than protagonist performance, probably due to the script or character selection. But Zuko and Iroh has done great deal of justice, the way they play through emotions for every flashback is enthralling for a fantasy series. I can't find fault with fire lord ozai himself or other antagonist roles. Having said that the protagonists definitely grow on you as the series progresses. Please watch few episodes before making your judgment. It deserves least one sit through and definitely entertaining.","rating":"7\/10","date":"7 March 2024"}
{"title":"Expected a lot worse! I'm very happy with it honestly.","review":"I'm a massive ATLA fan, ever since I was a kid. And I was super skeptical since the previous movie sucked, but I will say that it succeeded my expectations. The cgi was amazing, the visuals and the cinematography was incredible! I was pleasantly surprised, but now here comes my disappointment with the show - the acting.Though I definitely don't want to bash the teens who probably worked so hard to act in this show, like Gordon and Kiawentiio, however some of the older actors acting was pretty bad. Not to mention the way a lot of the dialogue was presented, it almost felt emotionless, extremely corny or sometimes rushed.Next is the clothes and prop designs - some of the costumes were amazing, yet many were almost like a cosplay design - cheaply made and just ugly and unrealistic. It even made me laugh sometimes.But otherwise, this is an amazing adaptation, and I expected something completely different and honestly, a lot worse.","rating":"8\/10","date":"22 February 2024"}
{"title":"We need more, but...","review":"As a devoted fan of the ATLA animated series, I anticipated some alterations to the storyline, but the extent of the changes caught me off guard. While the visual effects are undeniably stunning, I must admit that the graphics occasionally fall short, particularly evident in the initial episodes featuring Appa's flight scenes. Nevertheless, the overall execution of the visual effects and CGI is commendable. Regarding the performances, while some actors struggle to convey emotions effectively, it's worth noting that for most of them this project with such a big fan base is one of the first, so I remain hopeful that they will improve in the future.(SPOILERS AHEAD)\nAs an ATLA enthusiast, I found certain aspects of the second episode, particularly the depiction of Kyoshi, intriguing. However, other deviations from the original narrative were less appealing. For instance, the prominence of the owl in the spirit world and the minimal presence of Hei Bai felt somewhat misleading, given their prominence in promotional materials. Furthermore, the amalgamation of events from the Northern Air Temple, Jet's storyline, and the narrative surrounding Omashu felt disjointed. It's apparent that the writers themselves were occasionally uncertain, leading to inconsistencies that detracted from the viewing experience. The significant alteration of Bumi's character was disappointing, portraying him in a more negative light than his animated counterpart, imho. Moreover, the fact that Aang, the Avatar - master of all 4 elements, didn't even try to start mastering waterbending even after eight episodes was kind of ridiculous. When the moon spirit was killed and Aang went into the avatar state, he couldn't bend the water and was fighting the whole fire nation army BY BEING A GODZILLA?? Netflix, you can do better.In conclusion, while there are elements to appreciate, such as the bending visuals and some of the cast performances, the series ultimately falls short of expectations, earning a rating of 3 out of 10 from my perspective as a long-time fan.However, for viewers unfamiliar with the original series or willing to overlook significant deviations, the show may still hold appeal. It offers an engaging narrative, albeit with some inaccuracies, and features sharp bending sequences alongside a mostly competent cast. Overall, it serves as a decent option for those seeking a fantastical escape, earning a rating of 7 out of 10.Obviously, comparing it with the ATLA movie from 2010, this version is tremendously better, and despite the negative points of this particular show, this time I'm horrified, but still mostly excited and can't wait on what they'll come up with in the next season.","rating":"7\/10","date":"23 February 2024"}
{"title":"Visuals great, acting awful.","review":"I am an avid fan of the cartoon but even I know translating this into live-action shouldn't be shot-for-shot. Everyone's expections watching live-action are different than animation. This show had so many cringy moments that don't work in live-action. But the visuals were well done and the special effects didn't look cheesy. But, boy, was that dialogue cheesy. I found myself laughing at the poor acting. This is the blame of the director. How do I know that? Because I've seen some of these actors in other projects and they didn't act that poorly. It ruined the show for me. I'm hoping continued shows will improve acting and directing.","rating":"3\/10","date":"2 March 2024"}
{"title":"Mostly true to the source","review":"I just binged the entire first season of the live adaptation of Avatar the Last Airbender in a single day (don't judge me). I've gotta say, I was pretty giddy at seeing the characters that I knew and loved brought to life. Did they capture the core personalities of each? I'd have to say no. Sokka was neither sexist nor fundamentally funny. He had some laughs to be sure, but he wasn't the true Sokka. Katara was... not the physique of the animated version. Almost nobody was! These are supposed to be kids or teenagers in prime physical shape. Yet almost everyone is... well, not. They're all chubby Americans, true to stereotype. You'd better put them on the treadmill before they have to shed their outer layers. Bumi was disappointing, as was Koh and the story surrounding him. In short, I now understand why the original creators parted ways with Netflix, but it's still pretty good. I give it a seven.","rating":"7\/10","date":"23 February 2024"}
{"title":"Incredible in my opinion. Totally doesn't deserve that rating","review":"Well done for what it sought out to be, if you're going into this series hoping for a shot for shot remake of the acclaimed original then you will be let down. If however, you're going in with an open mind, it's a wonderful love letter to the fan base while still having its own new twists and plot points. While it's not a copy of the original series, it gets to the same plot points in its own ways. Young actors could use some work on certain scenes and some changes seem unnecessary but overall, it's perfect for what it's meant to be. Avatar has always been a great story but cartoons aren't for everyone. This series does the story justice in live action. Which is such a good feeling after having to live through the M Night Shyamalan disaster.","rating":"10\/10","date":"23 February 2024"}
{"title":"Many mistakes are acceptable, but I wish you hadn't made a Bollywood mistake that made the flow illogical.","review":"We watched an imbecile avatar watching the Ying and Yang fish being caught. He watched the fishing for two minutes.If there was an avatar who couldn't keep up with this scene, everything would have made more sense. A 10 year old wouldn't make such a big script mistake. At least if he did, we wouldn't be disappointed with this result. Many mistakes are acceptable, but I wish you hadn't made a Bollywood mistake that made the flow illogical.The characters of katara and sokku are more consistent than ang and katara's evolution is definitely more striking than ang's. The firebender uncle and the exiled son are equipped with all the ingredients of western and eastern myths and I would have been unfair to myself if I hadn't written the big script mistake I mentioned above.","rating":"6\/10","date":"26 February 2024"}
{"title":"better than the movie -- for hardcore fans who already know the canon","review":"Let's be clear. In my many reviews, over 2000, I have stated unambiguously that the original animated series is possibly the most perfect entertainment product ever to be offered in series form. (Much like Scott Adkins' infamous MMA film character was presented as the \"most perfect fighter.\") So how do you improve on perfection? Well, you don't do it by taking a pile of cash and producing one of the worst movies in history. Shame on you, M. Night Shyamalan. This current live action adaption clearly lacks the \"secret sauce\" that touched so many hearts, young and old, in the original. However, an oasis in a desert is still not to be spurned. As modern society in this decade implodes from within, there are worse fates, especially for fans, than finally getting live-action versions of characters and events that we once could only imagine. Not perfect. But a nice way to pass a cold winter's night. Yip yip.

{"title":"Great production value, super dry, bad directing","review":"Ok, I'd like to start of giving this series credit where it deserves credit. The special effects are excellent. The bending looks really fantastic. The animals are designed beautifully! So are the villages and landscapes.Ok, now to the meat of it. The whole thing was a drag. They basically dried up all the flavor of the Anime. The dialogue was super unnatural and came off more like a high school stage play or soap opera. To me, I blame this on the director.The plot was changed and wrecked some important elements of the original storyline. They basically did nothing at all to advance Aang's skills. They didn't really properly do Katara either. She basically went from no skills to instantly pulling off a million gallon water wall in a minute.They still made a lot of the same mistakes these creators make- don't change the parts we love! Keep the overall plot and characters the same. What I would approve of is making situations, emotions, reactions either more extreme of more visceral. The only advantage making a live action would bring is in these elements. Anger, surprise, grief, pain, stress, struggle- you have an opportunity to show these things in ways the anime can't. They actually went the opposite direction and made it so dry I was honestly very bored and had to force myself to finish it.I respect that some people involved in the project really tried and it's because of those elements I gave it 6 stars. It was a failure of writing and directing though. Overall it's better than the M Night Shamalan movie, but slightly less entertaining. A snoozer extraordinaire.","rating":"6\/10","date":"10 March 2024"}
{"title":"Why people hate everything is beyond me","review":"This series is 1000 times better than that movie. It doesn't give the same feeling as the cartoon but it offers so much more. Am I the only one who is getting crazy happy just to see our bold monk. By the way the cast seems ok and they might be better maybe the aang but he captures the essence of the role and as for fire nation they are so on point. I liked this show and I advise everyone to see it. Please don't hate on new tv series they are only made because we love the first one so much.

{"title":"Not as bad as I had feared, not as good as I had hoped","review":"Like many fans of the original show probably, I was looking forward to this show with cautious optimism. It had the potential to be great, but we had been burned before.And after watching the show I must say I'm slightly disappointed. It's not a bad show per se, the visuals are great and the story follows the main plot more or less. But there are a lot of changes that while they themselves are minor, due to there being so many collectively they do change the tone and story a lot.I won't go into details to avoid spoilers, but a lot of these changes seemed unnecessary and felt like they were made just to change things from the original and not because they served a purpose. Or to include as much as possible from a 20+ episode cartoon into an 8 episode live action show. I appreciate the intent, but mixing storylines or giving them to other characters doesn't always work and I wish they would have left some things out, instead of forcing them in there.Overall it's not a bad show, but it leaves a certain bad aftertaste in my mouth. I'm giving it a 6.5\/10.","rating":"7\/10","date":"25 February 2024"}
{"title":"Netflix, don't drop this show!","review":"I thought it was over for any live action version of avatar when I saw the terrible 2010 movie. It was bland and left a bad taste in my mouth. But this show.. It actually has seasoning. This is avatar, at least as well as it can be portrayed as a live action.We were definitely let down in the past, but let's be reasonable about this show. It's in my opinion unfair to judge the new remake so quickly and dismiss any new version of a live action based off of a past failure. I also know we tend to hype things up before it ever releases and set impossible expectations for the creators of the show.This show deserves way more credit for how accurately it adapted to the nickelodeon cartoon we all love. If they had to remake it again, I don't think there would be anything better to incorporate that this show didn't already think of. They remade core episodes in the correct order and did it so graciously. This felt very similar to the cartoon. The longer you get into the story, the more you don't want it to end. With the old movie, everything was rushed or even narrated.The cast... I mean seriously, where did they find the real life sokka! It's like he came out of the cartoon. Aang is an adorable character and the actor played the role very well. Zuko, Katara, honestly just everyone was perfectly casted. Even small background characters like the cabbage man made his comeback. The wardrobe, effects and scenery, just brilliantly done. Chef's freaking kiss. This show felt like watching the old cartoon again in a fresh light. I appreciate how funny, emotional, and even terrifying this show is. It didn't feel like it's made just for kids, but also for the fans who grew up with it.I am truly excited about this show and hope we get to see more of it.","rating":"10\/10","date":"24 February 2024"}

Is there bad? Yes but when is there a perfect show right off the bat. Just look at the show with the eyes of \"hey this show looks nice it's about a world where people can control elements and one kid can control all 4\" that's it. If you keep comparing a show to a show that's 10\/10 everything will look ass in comparison. So just look at it with fresh eyes.

The acting is terrible and the story is butchered. The character growth isn't there. Aang and his crew do stuff just to do stuff and it's so unbelievable. There's no rhyme or reason to the show. I now fully understand why the original creators of the show left. Netflix just doesn't respect the source and their fans. I'm really dissapointed I expected a good show once it was announced, after the creators left I was skeptical, I thought maybe they just left because of new animated shows. After the articles came out I was scared. But I wasn't scared enough. This show is terrible!","rating":"1\/10","date":"22 February 2024"}

It's almost as if the actress is having a hard time believing she's playing the role of katara and won't fully divulge into who she's playing. I think a couple more classes will really help season two feel real and authentic. I like the duo between aang and sokka.I genuinely believe the show did a good job at setting the scenes right and most of the characters are actinggggg. Zuko was actually a great cast because I feel like he has the attitude of zuko down. Would like to see the following seasons taken more seriously especially from the actress who plays katara. Feels too silly for her.","rating":"6\/10","date":"11 March 2024"}
{"title":"People expected too much","review":"I like this show, no it isn't exact to the animated series but that isn't essentially a bad thing. It follows as close as possible with having a stellar look-a-like casting choice and you can tell the heart is there. Media change is probably the reason for the rushed development, they had to squeeze in the budget and time frame. Whereas on an animation you can draw what and who you like.I like to see this as more of a \"This is what it would look like to turn the animated series into live action\" and that's what we got. The world of Avatar: The Last Airbender in stunning CGI and real people. You have to give it to the actors for really trying to resemble their animated versions, even if their dialog is a little wooden. The 'Cabbage Guy' in episode 3 was more of a cameo gag but i understand why it was in there. The writers really tried to map the cartoon but it unfortunately comes with it's problems. Same goes for most of the dialog from certain characters.My point is, don't let yourself get annoyed at the fact it isn't copied (as someone said in another review) \"frame by frame\", because it would just be daft to. Media change changes all aspects, it's not easy going from cartoon to live action, different rules apply. Different availabilities. Just sit back and enjoy some cool effects with still a good story.

It takes itself too seriously and not seriously enough at the wrong times.A better effort than the Shamalan adaptation and at time enjoyable but it fails to capture the soul that made you fall in love with the characters. Some of the new additions are welcome and the need to mesh storylines is understandable but the series tries to bring themes that are developed over three seasons of ATLA to the forefront too early and Aang's character arch is not mature enough to handle it yet.","rating":"6\/10","date":"27 February 2024"}
{"title":"Best Anime Adaptation since the Samurai X movies","review":"Proof once again, that it is possible to adapt anime into live action.It just takes great casting, great costumes and set designs , and a time of writers who understand the show and know how to summarize a story to fit the time constraints of a live-action setting with real, actors that age in real time.Just as how the Samurai X movies combined certain storylines from a 90episode cartoon into a successful trilogy.... so has this New Avatar series, successfully summarized a whole season 30min cartoon...into 8 live action episodes.For example SPOILER:\nI am only going to include 1 spoiler. In the original cartoon, the start of the main conflict is explained in a flashback. However in this series, the start of the conflict is shown in the first episode. I feel this worked much better for the pacing...as it allowed new audiences to immediately understand the story.This is just one example of a smart change.I hope they can greenlight this quickly and finish up the rest of the show before the child actors age out of their roles.We need to see this to the end.Congratulations to the team !","rating":"10\/10","date":"24 February 2024"}
{"title":"Mind-blowing VFX but....","review":"Coming into this show without having seen the original cartoon, I found myself captivated by the amazing visuals and action sequences. The special effects are truly top-notch, constantly delivering eye-catching moments that kept me engaged throughout. It's a feast for the eyes!However, there were some aspects that left me wanting more. The characters, while visually interesting, didn't have the same depth and connection that I think they should have.Pacing was also a bit of a rollercoaster. Some parts in the middle felt like they dragged on, slowing down the overall momentum. On the other hand, some scenes, particularly towards the end, felt rushed, leaving me wanting more development and emotional payoff.While I appreciate the potential for further exploration, I think the show would have benefitted from a more conclusive finale that didn't blatantly set up a sequel. It could have provided a stronger overall impact with a more definitive wrapping up of the story arc.Overall, for someone completely new to the Avatar universe, \"The Last Airbender\" offered some stunning visuals and exciting action. However, the lack of character depth and the uneven pacing held it back from reaching its full potential. I can see why fans of the original cartoon might be disappointed, but for newcomers like myself, it was a decent, visually impressive adventure with room for improvement.","rating":"7\/10","date":"5 March 2024"}
{"title":"Expectations blown","review":"I love it, this exactly the adaptation it needed. People are complaining about the lack of charcter development but you have to realize budget exists and a tight time constraint. These actors age so its really hard to put more extra scenes. But people gotta realise this is not a 1:1 recreation and im gald its not, we have so much new information, for one why Azula's fire changed color, of course still in theory, but got big clues. Honestly I could write a very lengthy review. The way they combined episodes was genius, they blend so seamlessly like they where meant to be one. I enjoyed the new take on Bumi, however one complaint is that they didn't show enough love for each other because Aang will name his son Bumi so they should've shown they are true friends, but i get it not enough time. Overall everything was exciting, you thought you knew the next scene but they where all refined, personally The story about Zuko and his 41st battalion, he risked everything for his people and he didn't ever mention he lost everything for them, so when Iroh tells them its even more impactful compared to the original. I just love this.","rating":"10\/10","date":"24 February 2024"}

What made the original series special was carefully crafting how the characters evolve and revealing why they are the persons now. Hints are spread through seasons for all main characters creating a strong bond with the viewer.If the aim was making the show shorter, just leaving some parts out could be a better solution instead of just throwing everything in a confused mix.I wish they made a series for a past or future avatar with all this budget and cast instead of a remake.

Big lack of kindness, compassion and solemnity. Fierce doesn't equal mean and agressive for Kyoshi. Kuruk is disturbed, not helpful. Roku is not supposed to look like a 90s character half funny half relevant. His wisdom, his greatness are very important in the original. Completely messed up by Netflix.8 episodes is not enough to wrap up action, intrigue and characters psychological development.BUT...Zhao, Azula, Arnook, Bumi, Ozai and Gyatso are AWESOME.Visual effects and bending look fabulous.This show really has a potential. I really hope they adjust to perfect it.","rating":"6\/10","date":"26 February 2024"}
{"title":"Flat as a flunder","review":"Sorry I say this, but most of the acting of the diverse characters played by teens is bad, and of the adults, to be true, minimum the half too. Little actors were convincing, main characters so and so, but often the secondary ones were really bad. Not always its the fault of the actors, it can be casting, and it seems mainly to me that directors did not care much about that part. Or writers, seems they did not care much either about giving dialogues depth. If they cared, it did not came through too often.I was constantly thrown out of the story by the acting...CGI good, but what made that possible is the good art design. There often was detail and I would say love in designing the tribes & their logic, spaces, clothes; specially the ships. Also the bending choreographies were coherent.","rating":"3\/10","date":"12 March 2024"}
{"title":"wtf is going on with the voices?","review":"I couldn't make it through the first episode because the voices all sound like a terrible dub. What is going on? If you are going to dub over actors who are literally speaking the lines on camera, it needs to be done FLAWLESSLY. Though I'm not even sure that this is dubbed? The voices and levels on the voices of the characters just sounds super bizarre and unnatural. It's literally so bad that the show is unwatchable. How did this get the green light? Am I taking crazy pills or does it sound like the actors are speaking from inside a low budget sound booth? I'm padding this review for length, sorry.","rating":"","date":"10 March 2024"}
{"title":"No \"thank you for penguin sledding with me.\"?","review":"I feel disappointed with so much mix and match of events. Every story in avatar is worth telling, and doesn't deserve to be tangled with other events to shorten them. Even The Great Divide is worth telling. They skipped so much. I mean, where is Jeong Jeong? The comedic element is almost negligible.I think it's very fast paced. And there are some major restructuring of storytelling which is achieved by taking shortcuts. It's like movie version of a detailed book. You lose so much in a movie but if you read the original book, you find so much more depth to every story. I can see why the original creators of the avatar universe parted ways from this project. They did make some changes to the story too. The fandom probably won't like those changes. Not major changes but ATLA fandom is very religious about the show. Like, penguin sledding is quite a significant event in a hindsight.There won't be many surprises or plot twists for you if you watch the animated series after you watch the live action series. Actually same can be said about the live action series but the level of detail you get in the animated series makes it worth watching it first.Acting is good for the most part. Visuals are great! Casting could have been better.As a standalone series, this would have been rated a lot higher. So, there is surely a bias when reviewing this series, not just from me, but from the whole fandom. And I would say, rightfully so. We know what it could've been if done correctly. It only reflects how amazing this story and universe is, even when the whole story isn't told correctly, if that makes sense. As Zuko often says, all hope is lost (for future seasons).

This live action doesn't disappoint and the characters I fell in love with in the anime version of the show are full of life. I like that they kept the foundation and made interesting changes. Netflix in my eyes continues to deliver. The special effects are so realistic they definitely blew my mind. The story writing is fun definitely creative.

{"title":"Actors ain't all that","review":"The show's effects are really good and they blend the plot of the original show together well, yet the actors seem like they're trying too hard to copy the original characters. Also, the children and young actors can't speak concisely and their sentiments sound forced. It may seem harsh bashing child actors, but with them being the main characters and focus of the show, there isn't a huge amount of wiggle room for mistake. With that being said, the show is a big step up from the movie based on the cartoon, and as a happy consumer of the cartoon, the 2024 show is very nostalgic and (most of the time) it makes up for the mediocre acting jobs.I would also like to add that, as a kid, acting never bothered me and I'd bet if you showed this to your kids they'd think this show is the best thing ever.","rating":"7\/10","date":"27 February 2024"}

Including all major side characters!!! Yessss some stuff gets cut out but likeeeee it's fine. The best live action remake I've ever seen for sure.

{"title":"Pretty decent","review":"Obviously nothing will be better than the original.Graphics are good!Watch with low expectations. And don't expect great acting or the story interest. If you go in With expectation of the 2010 movie you won't be disappointed.Stuck to the story for the most part. Ang doesn't learn anything in season one.In the original he had water bending down somewhat.Acting is a little lack luster.I would say Acting overall no one stand out as a good actor\/actress.Also so dumb that the avatar must bear the burden alone narrative. Like why is that part of the story in season one. The the big part of season 3.They did king boomy wrong. A wise\/crazy man. Just is a crazy mad man.Sakka was nerfed a lot. Season one grows a lot into a great worrier. By the end still kinda weak. He is also not as funny. He was brave! They seems to have strip a lot of his good traits and gave them katar.Ang doesn't seem to care about learning any other form of bending. Part of the greatness of ang is his silliness and willingness to learn. Dude don't want to learn any of the basics at all and is a little to serious. And never learned any other bending in season one. He could at least do some water bending.Katar: acting is probably the worst, but her character is the closest to the actual character in the show. Just poor acting and Adding extra stuff to her. Also a little cheesy when all the water bender women \"let us get the job done\" stuff. Like cringy. End of season one she's leading with zero experience is defenses military stuff. That's always been Sakka thing. Seems like they took all the positives of Dallas and gave it to katar. You found a master \"you're looking at her\" so cheesy!! I don't understand the issue with her having a master. Nothing wrong with learning from someone. Honestly almost turned it off after that dumb line.Zulu: a LOT OF CHEESY stuff. \"Which do you choose\" line when having to get any or general iro. He himself wasn't to cheesy but everyone interacting with him was ugh..Positives: some different twist on how the stories play out. Little sad I don't get to me the swamp water benders.

But I did not go into this LA iteration with the ridiculous expectation of seeing a shot for shot remake of the original. Rather, this series finally delivered on what I have dreamed of for almost 20 years, a faithful, more mature, and ultimately fun adaptation for a beloved fantasy series delivered by a cast and crew that clearly hold as much respect and love for the series as the fans.","rating":"10\/10","date":"24 February 2024"}
{"title":"A watch for Unfamiliar Viewers","review":"Netflix's live-action adaptation of \"Avatar: The Last Airbender\" arrives with a hefty weight of expectation. The beloved animated series won hearts with its action, humour, and emotional storytelling.Unquestionably, the series has strong visuals. The essence of the world is successfully captured by the breathtaking sceneries, expansive art direction and costume design. Some performers are not able to portray the original roles, while others, like Daniel Dae Kim as Fire Lord Ozai, really stand out. But then the story falls flat. Fans of the animated series will get confused by significant changes made to the narratives and departures from the original material. Furthermore, the bending action moments don't have the same powerful smoothness as the animation.The show upholds the core themes of friendship, hope, and balance that struck a chord with viewers despite these flaws. The first few episodes do a good job of setting up the show's universe by introducing the various nations and bending techniques. Nevertheless, condensing the first season of the animated series into a small number of live-action episodes leads to a superficial exploration of the characters and the world in which they exist. The humorous timing and charm of the original are also lost on the show.\"The Last Airbender\" on Netflix is an overall visually stunning but erratic rendition. Although there is a clear attempt to mimic the spirit of the adored program, the narrative is greatly impacted by the hurried pacing and artistic license. While new viewers could be captivated by the world and characters to keep watching, fans of the original series may end up unsatisfied.The series boasts some undeniably impressive moments, particularly in the action department. The fight choreography, while not perfectly mirroring the animated series' fluidity, delivers well-rehearsed and visually striking sequences. Witnessing the bending techniques come to life, with bursts of water, swirling earth, and controlled fire, offers a thrilling spectacle. These moments, coupled with the show's captivating landscapes and costume design, provide bursts of visual entertainment for viewers seeking action and a glimpse into this fantastical world.","rating":"6\/10","date":"15 March 2024"}
{"title":"Nostalgic, but not great on its own","review":"I certainly feed the nostalgia of the animate series, but if I hadn't seen that, I would not have watched this past the first episode.The special effects are overall pretty good, although they are quite noticable at times, but it's miles ahead of the Shyamalan movies.The main issue here is the dialogue and the acting. You can't just carbon copy an anyme to live action, because everything will feel extremely cringe and wooden, which is exactly what happened here. Anime characters tend to feel older than they are, but something feels off when a 12 year old is saying something profound or a 15 year old is in charge of the military.The acting isn't very good and everything feels like lines being read from a page.There are worse things out there, but this isn't the amazing remake people were hoping for.","rating":"5\/10","date":"3 March 2024"}

The minor changes make sense, and if people are down scoring it because it's not the exact script from the cartoon, then they're delusional. The writers got rid of some side quests, fleshed out the characters a bit more, and added grit. I absolutely love the portrayals of the cast. Aang is top-notch. Sokka is brilliant. Katara is great. Zuko is wonderful. And Iroh, who is my favorite character in the animated series, gets better and better as each episode progresses. And to the people who say this was worse than Shymalan's.....you've gotta be kidding me.","rating":"10\/10","date":"24 February 2024"}
{"title":"It's serviceable","review":"It was a mistake having to go into this with expectations even knowing that it wouldn't even be anywhere near the level the animated series was on. But it looked well enough for it to be considered as a worthy adaptation and honestly looking back at the season, it does try to make it be that way, but it runs into the habit of \"biting more than it can chew.\"To say it's a disappointment can be understandable but I've also always been under the perception that adaptations or remakes need to be viewed under an entirely different lens as it's essentially a new take of the story it's basing it off of. I can cut it some slack but even still it's hard to go through some of these scenes because there's a lot that's being poorly merged together even though it shouldn't really have done that to begin with.You have several storylines that are trying to fit into the main narrative and multiple episodes basically acting as two parters. The structure feels off especially when you get to the halfway point of the season and I feel as though a rewrite could have been needed to improve the overall pacing. There's certainly some things they did right but it was like when one good thing happens, it's followed up by five bad things.","rating":"6\/10","date":"29 February 2024"}
{"title":"THE TRUE ADAPTATION WE ALWAYS NEEDED","review":"Amazing storytelling, this might be different from the animation in quite a few ways but it still feels like ATLA, the visuals, the phenomenal bending, the amazing action scenes, the surroundings, the costumes, the worldbuilding, the creature designs and not to mention the phenomenal soundtracks courtesy of Takeshi Furukawa and his amazing team. Sure there were some iffy moments, like the constant exposition in episode 1 but I made it pass due to the fact that I knew that was for new viewers who haven't seen the Original series before which was always going to be needed and was always going to be annoying to those who already knew the story but that's okay and there were also some scenes to nitpick but not enough to take me out of the story 9.5\/10.","rating":"10\/10","date":"22 February 2024"}
{"title":"Mostly negative impressions saved by probable nostalgia","review":"Although seemingly a high review for a show with more negatives than positives, I feel pretty comfortable rating season 1 with a 7.I can't exactly pinpoint any redeeming features aside from nostalgia towards the original animated series and huge and drawn out excitement over this shows release (which wasn't entirely 100% sabotaged, like some other live actions).To start with I will go over what I did like about the show.. It was fairly accurate to its original content, by that I mean they didn't totally change or re-write things that have happened. What I actually immediately and much more frequently noticed was content being missing, rather than being inaccurate or revisionist. This is an overall plus to me, because one of the worst offenses (in my perspective) when creating a live action show based on cartoons, is when writers start changing things. It's offensive to the original creator and also egotistical to think they know better. This show wasn't so much a victim of that, not nearly as much as others. I felt it was true to the original - just not comprehensive or whole.Now for the bad..The actors, or characters were ALL very bland, dry, and didn't really portray their cartoon equivalent very well at all. The closest character I felt to the original was probably Bumi who played a relatively small and undercut role. More on this later but Bumi entire story was cut short and parts are missing (unless are yet to come, in which case would be out of chronological order). It felt to me as though they made these characters more appealing to kids (or too PG) by removing any sense of identity and likeability. I can't really nail down the specific reasoning, but I just get the feeling by making these characters more kid friendly they took away any sense of identity and personality. This was specifically an issue with Aang, but also noticable with others such as Katara and Sokka. You get the sense of the characters Katara and Sakka are meant to be portraying (such as Kataras bossiness or Sakka's silliness), but they don't really get the desire effect. It's half hearted at best. After watching the entire series I still can't decide exactly say if this is a writing problem, directing problem or a casting problem..Without any spoilers I will just say that whole storylines from the original are removed or heavily condensed from this series, I guess in order to make a more coherent storyline given the limited timeframe of episodes and trying to reach a certain point in the story by the end of the season. I personally think this along with the dry acting were the two biggest downfalls of the show.It felt as if they tried to cover way too much of the Avatar storyline in too few episodes of this new show. It's like as if they wanted to get as much out there in the chance that they won't be able to make it any further (the show not being renewed). I don't really understand the point of this. It pretty much ruined the storytelling and character arcs up until this point. Not seeing certain arcs completely changes the way you see different characters or the way you feel about them. They also come off as 'less real' if possible, considering they are all fictional characters. More interestingly they waste time showing life for Aang before being frozen, which was never featured in the original. One place where scenes definitely could have been cut for more integral storylines that were cut.I think the show would have been better both in its current state, and in the future if they just took things more slowly. I think that season 1 should have ended somewhere around the time the southern water tribe was attacked, prior to the whole adventure even unfolding. For context - that was the end of episode 1. So realistically they covered what I think should have been an entire season in just one episode.. Why? Was it because they thought the show wouldn't make it to the end of the story otherwise? What other possible reason could they have? And wouldn't slowing things down given more job stability in the future? In other words, the longer they could have drawn the series out the more work they have for longer..It's not just that things happen too fast. The problem lies in that whole storylines are condensed, removed and basically ruined. One part where this was extremely evident to me was the compacting of the story of the 'blue spirit'. In the cartoon there are several interactions before Aang finds out who it really is. In the live action he finds out way too soon which ruins the entire plot of that arc. There are several other instances of the same thing, basically every arc with some being worse offenders than others such as the sokka + princess Yue arc. You really would need to go over every character and their interactions to see what was missed.Also they removed\/cut very integral scenes - one that sticks out like a sore thumb is the (literally infamous) 'Yip Yip' scene from the animation. I have a hard time believing this wasn't at least filmed and ended up being cut.. This was absent from The Last Airbender live action - but funny enough got a reference in the recent animated series 'The Dragon Prince' having one of the characters jokingly call out 'Yip Yip' in order to get a dragon to fly.. and it works.Given that I had been looking forward to this show coming out for literally years now I think that also adds to the disappointment, or created unreasonably high expectations.. Maybe not everyone followed so closely, but this show was originally announced in 2018, so from it's announcement took almost 6 years to produce. The longer you have to wait for something the better you expect it to be. Otherwise things come across as 'overhyped' which sadly to say I think the Avatar live action leans towards in my perspective.It also hints at the next problem with this show.. Although there were strikes and other setbacks like covid during the making of this show - it took a really long time to come out with this first season. Not even renewed for a second season as of writing. So we are looking at quite a wait for a season 2 potentially. I can't exactly blame the show itself for this but I think it compounds the problem of rushing storylines... We wait all this time and you're going to miss stuff and rush through content?Despite the seemingly negative review - I still personally enjoyed it. I doubt I would recommend it to anyone who didn't watch the original cartoons, I don't think it is a good watch for people such as that. I think it provides the nostalgia for those that did watch the cartoon (and probably several run throughs at that). Even given all of that, I am personally looking forward to a potential season 2 still. Given the issues at hand there is still time and possibility to fix the mistakes - I don't have much optimism that will happen, but still gives you something to look forward to.","rating":"7\/10","date":"25 February 2024"}

{"title":"A MIXED BAG, but not a total disapointment","review":"Being a childhood & life long fan of the original series & similar to many others who have said it before me it's a MIXED BAG, although a massive improvement from the movie it still could have been way better at paying respect to original series.I wouldn't completely pan it as some have, as an original series it is good with some forced dialog that seems uncomfortable (specially in the first episode). However the visuals, action scenes (even though some changed), were great and even had a few good changes to the story & dialog to bring in some emotion, but you have to say some of the vital & best parts have been cut out or cropped together or changed in an uneventful way that it loses the brilicance which we all loved about the original series. I unerstand you can't expect the exact blue print of the original animated series but the lead charaters story lines, traits & important story shouldn't have been altered and should have payed more respect to the original adaptation. Now I understand why DiMartino & Konietzko left the project.Someone watching this for the first time without watching the animation series will enjoy it, but if you are a hard core fan you need to watch this as a completely original adaptation not as a bring to life of the animated series, you are only going to be underwhelmed. I'd re watch the animated series many more times but will not be rewatching this anything in the future again.Personally as a hard core fan I expected more 8hrs of episodes is more than enough to bring to life much of the important parts of the series but it focuses on few unimportant additions. But I am happy it's not a total failiure as the movie. If season 2 is green lit I hope the story, writing & better homage to the original is improved.","rating":"7\/10","date":"23 February 2024"}

{"title":"sadly disappointing","review":"Just because it's not as bad as the 2010 movie does not mean it's by any means good. There are so many unnecessary plot changes that instead of enhancing the original masterpiece, somehow make the story worse. Azula showing emotions other than arrogance is supposed to be saved for the last season when she truly looses control. The pace is so rushed even though they have practically the same amount of time as the cartoon since each episode is almost an hour long, rather than 20 minutes like the original. The actors are doing all they can with the poor writing they aren't to blame when they aren't given good direction. I completely understand why the original creators left. Roku is funny and making jokes when in the cartoon when he's older he's much calmer than younger him. Also, the wigs, it is 2024, and they have a multi million dollar budget, it's honestly unacceptable. My only hope is that they learn from this season and aren't so prideful and egotistical that they won't take the critiques to heart and improve the next seasons to be released.","rating":"3\/10","date":"3 March 2024"}
{"title":"A disappointment compared to the original.","review":"It started nicely but degraded with each episode. Don't expect the quality and depth of the original series. Also they tried to condense the story and for me it didn't work. The character development is completely missing. The fights are sparse and slow and unimpressive.The effects are decent though. And they have added some very nice backstory elements (Zukor and the 41st for example).It is worth watching. I understand that making a live action series that was completely true to the original would probably cost an excessive amount of money due to the sheer amount of fights and effects that would be needed. But still I think that the only way to do this justice is to spend a lot of money and make no compromises to the story and characters.","rating":"7\/10","date":"25 February 2024"}
{"title":"Really good Adaptation, Don't Trust the other biased Reviews. Come with an open mind and you won't be dissapointed.","review":"Come with an open mind, not expecting a like-for-like adaptation and you will see an awesome series. So many plotholes or meh-looking motivations of the original animation series have been fixed, and the motivations are a bit more serious.******SPOILER ALERT******There is that childlike innocence for the Avatar but fear of not knowing how to do what he has to do but following his nature at the same time.The visual effects and bending are awesome. The child actors emotions can look a bit underwhelming at the beginning, but it gets really better as the episodes go on and the best emotions come out in the last episode.The fear generated from the fire nation, Azula being pushed to the utmost of her mind tether, setting up for how showing us why she is the way she is, and why she does the things she is going to do in the future seasons.A lot of backstory was shown instead of telling in the form of reliving flashbacks as depressive memories.Overall, the series is not perfect, but unlike all the other reviews say, it's an awesome series. It stays true to the Core of The Avatar Series. It's a serious version of the incidents, but definitely a good adaptation. You will like it even if you haven't watched the original version. It's worth giving it a try. I really enjoyed it.Give it a watch with an open heart and mind, you won't be disappointed.Good job Netflix.

She's portraying Azula as some whiney valley girl than an actual badass monster who is absolutely ruthless in her devoting to 'winning' and getting her fathers approval.And whilst Paul Sun-Hyung Lee is doing well in the Iroh role, he needs to push the boat more on potraying Iroh's widsom and at times stoic demeanor. I'm hoping this is something he will work on for season 2.Storyline wise, this season definitely needed to be 10 episodes long. There was a lot of character development storylines that were incorrectly cut and because of it the characters are becoming distortions of how they truly should be. I'm confident this is why Michael Dante DiMartino and Bryan Konietzko leave the show, because they knew Netflix's choice to make this incorrect cuts would negatively affect the show.Hopefully for season 2 they come back and are allowed to fix the mistakes that season 1 made.Obviously the show can't replace Sokka's and Azula's actors, but hopefully they can at least be given proper training into improving their acting abilities.","rating":"7\/10","date":"25 February 2024"}
{"title":"Pretty decent adaptation!","review":"People are only saying bad things about it, because it's \"cool\" to rag on things. The same people that are like \"I only watch subbed anime, never dub. Only true anime fans watch sub only\" It really wasn't bad. People just like to s*** on things. Just watch it and make your own opinion. Remember it will be different at times. If you wanted to watch the exact same show then watch the animated version. Some of the differences they made are because the actors will age by season 2&3 and so they have to write the story accordingly. This is live-action, actors age. Again watch the animated version if you want the exact same show. That's what it's there for. People are so weird getting all upset over this.","rating":"10\/10","date":"23 February 2024"}
{"title":"It's like a disappointing meal","review":"Watching this show was getting your meal at a restaurant 60-70% how you asked for it. Do you ask them to remake it, as in don't watch this remake and wait for the next ATLA media, or do you just accept it as is? This show is leagues better than the Shamalama movie that we got but I think it tries too hard. There's too much exposition where I wanted action or plain comedy goodness. Certain character arcs have been completely changed.Instead of squishing 3 episodes into one I'd prefer if they cut those episodes out.Instead of changing Aang from a lovable, comedic 12 year old KID who just wants to have fun into a mopey, traumatized exposition robot I'd prefer he'd be a mute. Maybe then he'd actually focus time on learning waterbending. Instead he didn't waterbend ONCE.At least the effects looked great, the bending looked amazing and the sets were fantastic. My hope is that this show will introduce new fans to the franchise who will go back and watch the original cartoon. We still have time for the show to turn around too, since we know a book 2 & 3 are coming they have time to listen to our critique and take steps in the right direction.","rating":"6\/10","date":"15 March 2024"}
{"title":"Beware of review bombers, watch for yourself","review":"I watched with friends and we really enjoyed it! Bunch of different levels of avatar fandom in our group, as for me, I watched the original several times. A lot of solid aspects to this version (coreagraphy, maintenance of the heart of the story, etc). Definitely a bit of clunkiness with dialogue and acting, but overall still fun to watch. It is apparent that a lot of heart went into it. Really, don't let other people influence your judgement before you give it a chance. It seems that people are posting extreme polars for ulterior motives (e.g., fishing for views\/controversy or political ideology). Wish that people just learned to take themselves less seriously.","rating":"8\/10","date":"25 February 2024"}
{"title":"Good live action adaptation","review":"Just like other reviews I would agree this it was in general a good adaptation of the cartoon series, but due to the nature of live action and the limited episodes a lot was missed from the the original which IMO will never be replicated in live action.However with this said I think they have done a good job to capture the main storyline. A couple subplots have been altered to tie together I would assume to save screen time. They did a good job on a few character traits which the original such a hit but not enough to get it close to how good the original was.I think down to the limit of episodes it felt a little squashed and crammed trying to put such an expansive world, storylines and character traits into only 8 episodes. But overall I have been pleasantly surprised at how good overall it was been.","rating":"7\/10","date":"23 February 2024"}
{"title":"I love One Piece, but Avatar is better.","review":"I had to re-evaluate the series after watching it for the second time. The series is AMAZING! It's really good and now it's my favorite live action series, surpassing One Piece! All the questions I raised the first time were due to not paying attention to details, but the series is well resolved and with just one \"flaw\" Aang doesn't bend water this season, however you might think that The Book of a certain element It is the phase where Aang learns how to bend a certain element or you can think of it as the book where Aang finds his master of a certain element. In this book of Water Aang found his self-taught master and she will be Katara, who proved to be a rare bender of the water element. It was clear to Pakko that her bending was not inferior to his, she just had no combat experience. Yes, Katara is like that in the cartoon! Don't forget that in the cartoon she learned the rarest bend in her tribe just by hearing it and seeing it, that was enough for her to bend blood! While mastering the technique took years.I also think Aang should have waterbended, but he refused at first when Katara wanted to train him, but he now has the water master with him and will continue training.","rating":"10\/10","date":"23 February 2024"}
{"title":"It's okay, as expected","review":"Now it's obviously not going to be like the original. What's the point of copying it word for word? That being said, some changes were nice and others weren't.They did take away a lot of the humor and character the main cast had. This was for an obvious reason, the people watching the live action version are now likely young adults and so the theme would be darker. Humor comes from the artstyle too, which wasn't possible with live action.But the characters and their personalities have been muted down significantly. That didn't have to be done. Now it feels super bland.Anyways, pretty nice. Beautiful sets and effects, most actors are pretty good at their roles, especially Zuko.This was definitely better than the first live action adaptation, and it was pretty satisfactory in my opinion. I wish they hadn't removed so many flaws that the characters that had made them relatable though.","rating":"6\/10","date":"24 February 2024"}
{"title":"Rushed all the way","review":"This was a huge disappointment. I tried to overlook some issues on the first episodes to give it a chance but using events from the original on a random chronogical order is the dumbest thing I've ever seen. There is a reason why those events happened in that time and order. In Omashu episode, using arcs of Jet, Mechanist and King Bumi at the same time is so illogical that I couldn't even force myself to understand. After that they also even used the cave of two lovers... Without Katara and Aang being together in the cave, why would it bore importance? Avatar Roku doesn't even tire himself to show flashbacks of the past. And biggest absurd thing is the Monk Gyatso's return in the spirit world. What was really going on the minds of the writers? They couldn't even portray the characters correctly.Most characters have different personalities. Avatar Roku cracks cringe jokes, King Bumi is a whiny old crybaby trying to took his anger off on aang, Uncle Iroh's face is dead-pan and getting slapped by random soldiers, Sokka can't even make a joke.Where are all the humour and emotion? Depth and meaning? It's like chat-gpt wrote the episodes. Events come and go. Like as the viewers already know what will happen, they choose to just show a glimpse then jump to another event. Everything is lackluster.","rating":"3\/10","date":"22 February 2024"}
{"title":"I don't understand the bad reviews","review":"For me, the adaptation was more than good; yes, it's different from the original series, but they should understand that this is an adaptation. It doesn't make sense to criticize negatively an adaptation that never aimed to be a 1\/1 replica of the original animation. They kept almost the entire original script; obviously, there were changes, which in my opinion were good. You can't expect them to maintain childish jokes in a series aimed at a family audience.The cast is impeccable, the plot remained almost the same, of course, there were changes, but for the better, such as when Aang is possessed by Avatar Kyoshi, that didn't happen in the series, but I still thought it was a great move.Overall, I liked all the changes a lot. I hope that due to the negative reviews, Netflix doesn't back out from releasing the second and third seasons.I understand the reason why the original creators left, but still, it's a great adaptation, in any case, a thousand times better than the trash Shyamalan made. They criticize this adaptation for the changes (which were actually few), but they praise the live-action One Piece? I don't understand people, they criticize just for the sake of criticizing.It's not perfect, but it's pretty good and enjoyable, and the changes are pretty good.","rating":"7\/10","date":"28 February 2024"}
{"title":"Don't believe the 5-6\/10 ratings","review":"All the bad reviews are by the toxic cult gate keeping the animated series. I've watched the anime and I understand it's unmatchably great. But this live action adaptation is so true to the animation, they did a really great job man. All the cast are amazing (except Katara for me).Obviously for live action medium, they needed to crisp it up, so certain plot points are trimmed, but that's ok. It doesn't feel rushed or anything.This adaptation is a solid 8-8.5\/10. But I'm giving it a 10 to balance the bad ratings given by the toxic nay sayers.Be wise guys, don't let Netflix cancel this one. You will never get a better live action adaptation better than this.","rating":"10\/10","date":"27 February 2024"}
{"title":"Decent but doesn't hold up to the original","review":"This show is so frustrating. After years and years of waiting for a proper live action adaptation of this beloved series, we have been served a clearly mismanaged, Hollywood-producer-influenced, beautiful but broken version of ATLA.My first biggest issue was the pacing, which was a direct symptom of my other biggest issue which was what they decided to show us as the main plot. Too much of the details from Book 1: Water were either mashed together too much in one episode or were omitted entirely. The fact that we didn't even see Aang learn water bending with\/from Katara is numbskull writing. On top of that the characters felt watered down due to the lack of said details, because there simply wasn't enough room for character development unless it was slapping us in the face. Aang flying in episode one... I'm not even gonna touch that one.Continuing my criticisms, there was too much fan service in this first season by giving us characters like Kyoshi, Kuruk, and Wan Shi Tong when they're not even in Book 1. That really annoyed me, especially when Kyoshi appeared IN THE REAL WORLD in front of everyone. Which brings me to my issue with the writers changing the mechanics of the universe the characters live in. The Kyoshi example illuminates the Avatar side of it, where Katara and Sokka being in the spirit world shows the issues from the spirit side of things.On a more positive note, there were a lot of things I liked. The casting was done, in my opinion, pretty much perfectly for each character. This goes especially for the main ones. From looks, to demeanor, to voices, to delivery of the role, they all performed their characters very well. Also, the bending and fight scenes were all so fun to watch, that was something they definitely got right. Next, the locations were gorgeous, even if it was mostly cgi. It felt as real as they could get it without building whole cities. Lastly, I like that they kept the main plot in tact despite all of their writing potholes.Overall I enjoyed the show, no matter how annoyed it made me at the writers. My rating is a light 6.5\/10.","rating":"6\/10","date":"7 March 2024"}
{"title":"Very impressive","review":"I have not seen the cartoon, and from what I hear there are creative differences from the cartoon and the show and that is the main cause of the negative reviews. Which is a shame because I do not believe it deserves it.From my point of view this show is extremely impressive. It is like watching a AAA film every episode. This is done better than a lot of 200 million dollar Marvel movies, it puts what Disney makes to shame. The production quality of this show is the best I have ever seen in any TV show. The story is good (8\/10), the choreography and how they use bending power is fantastic (10\/10), world building is fantastic(10\/10). They have massive fantasy cities and large scales wars at the fraction of the budget of the rings of power. The battle scenes in this show put the battles in the wheel of time and rings of power to shame, which should ask the question what are the other studios doing with their budget??Overall, this show is very very good, if you are interested in a fantasy show I would definitely recommend this.","rating":"9\/10","date":"24 February 2024"}
{"title":"7\/10.","review":"As someone who hasn't watched or seen the original anime, I'd rate the Netflix series adaptation of \"Avatar: The Last Airbender\" a seven out of ten. Here's my take:Pros:The series was good, capturing the essence of the original world and characters.The visuals and action sequences were impressive.Cons:Some of the lines and jokes felt a bit lame. They lacked the wit and charm I expected.While it wasn't a full entertainment, it falls into the average category.Overall, it's worth a watch, especially if you're new to the Avatar universe.

{"title":"Rushed but exciting","review":"I loved the cartoon and I loved this adaptation. I see them as seperate. I mean they have made this world come to live in a more mature and action filled way.They have chosen to change the order and some details, but at the core the important moments and charactistics are there. The atmosphere is thrilling and moving. The outfits are great and so is the set design. The story feels a bit rushed but it wasn't a dealbreaker for me.The humor of the characters is still there but of course less, but I understand that it is much easier to incorporate exaggarating facial expressions and comical moments in a cartoon than in this adaptation.I do feel like they should have focused more on the childish innocent side of aang rather than rushing him to be a mature protagonist.","rating":"10\/10","date":"24 February 2024"}

We could not stop. The amount of people who complained about no humor i don't get it. For people who say it went to serious...are you kidding? If you look at the actual plot it's about inserting children's into a long and bloody war, of course live action is going to look and feel more intense. All I know is this series seriously deserves more credit where credit is due especially with all the terrible movies and series that have been coming out in the last 2 years. TEAM AVATAR!

{"title":"A Review Full Of Controversy (Probably)","review":"I am going to start off by saying this, I am currently rewatching the OG avatar series so the differences and nuances from the animated show compared to this one are all fresh in my mind. Secondly I was first introduced to the world of ATLA by the 2010 movie and fell in love with certain casting choices from the movie, such as the beautiful Seychelle Gabriel as Princess Yue, Dev Patel as Zuko, Summer Bishil as our fiery Princess Azula (for the 5 seconds you see her) and Cliff Curtis and Shaun Toub as Fire Lord Ozai and Uncle Iroh. Not the most accurate castings I know but ones I fell in love with. I also liked the actor for Sokka, Jackson Rathbone and Nicola Peltz and Noah Ringer for Katara and Aang.So that being said lets get into the review for the 2024 ATLA show.Starting off with the casting, while it's not the cast I fell in love with 14 years ago on the movie (which I know everyone hates) it is a more accurate casting to the original characters so as much as I would want to I can't fault them there. However what I can fault the cast for or maybe the director is the terrible acting. Now before everyone starts yelling at me and saying the acting is amazing go and watch the OG show again and you will see just how wooden the performances we get in the live action show are.Aang is the worst with the Katara actress just being super shy and unable to express emotion properly, though this could just be due to how her character is written and the fact that Katara has unfortunately had a lot of her character depth removed in the show. On the other hand the actress who plays her, Kiawentiio is very beautiful and I do look forward to seeing her in future projects and in season 2 after she has had some more time to develop her skills further. My beloved Sokka is no where near as fun, bubbly and full of funny remarks as he is in the animated show, though once again this is also partially due to the script and the fact that those moments are just not included in the show. Ian Ousley is not a bad casting choice but I don't really like the casting choice very much as I just feel that Jackson Rathbone is a better embodiment of Sokka.Princess Yue is played by the absolutely beautiful Amber Midthunder, who I am a fan of from her performance in the prequel Predator film Prey. While I enjoyed her performance here quite a lot I just couldn't get into it as every time I saw her hair aka that terrible wig they have her wearing it just throws me off completely. Seychelle Gabriel who plays Princess Yue in the movie is just as beautiful and unlike poor Amber is blessed with an actual realistic looking wig and beautiful blue eyes that enhances her characters beauty rather then take away from it. I do wish that Netflix had made Amber's eyes blue in the show as well via the use of contacts or something so she could more closely resemble her animated counter-part.Zuko is okay to be honest but that's it, just okay. He definitely needs some fixing in the script so that his actor Dallas Liu has more to work with. Dev Patel while having barely anything to actually work with gave us a glimpse of the depth and character he could bring to Zuko given a better script and still gave us a really great performance. Azula on the other hand is terrible, I'm sorry but I just can't for the life of me see the show Azula as Azula at all. In the 5 seconds in the movie where I get to see Summer Bishil as Azula she makes me see her as highly intelligent, beautiful, eager to please her father and very, very powerful and dangerous. The casting choices for Mai and Ty Lee were just terrible, like I honestly don't know what the casting director was thinking there. Plus they shouldn't even have been introduced in season 1 and the introduction they did get was them just standing around watching Azula practice.The actor for fire lord Ozai, Daniel Dae Kim is honestly not bad at all, I have nothing negative to say there and will actually say that his performance was really enjoyable though I do love Cliff Curtis as an actor. Paul Lee who plays Uncle Iroh is alright as well but I loved Shaun Toub's portrayal and can't help but compare the two and personally I liked Shaun's more (if only he had a good script to work with!).An honorable mention is to the absolutely stunning Maria Zhang who plays Suki and whose portrayal of the character I absolutely loved! She really gave me the vibes of the OG animated show Suki and just did a wonderful job overall so props to her for her performance!To round it off, in terms of acting the show is very wooden, without the expressive characters and emotions and interactions we have come to love in the OG show.Next up we have storyline and while it's far more faithful to the OG show then the movie was I still am not happy with it, it feels very rushed with random things taken from other seasons of the OG show and mashed together. So while it is more accurate to the animated show I still hate what they did to it, for example they got rid of my boy Avatar Roku and replaced him with Kyoshi as Aang's go to avatar guide, which there was absolutely no need to do. This also completely destroys the importance of Avatar Roku and his connection to Fire Lord Sozin, Prince Zuko and the start of the 100 years war. The character development is also really bad with Aang, Sokka, Katara, Zuko and Azula no longer being the characters we love so much from the OG show. Sokka is no longer our misogynistic, sarcastic guy who develops into a well rounded and loved character. Also King Bumi is just a bitter, resentful old guy filled with rage now, gone is his wisdom and fun loving personality. So story wise while it's not bad, especially if you haven't watched the original cartoon, it is not to my liking and I am definitely disappointed with it. The parts I did enjoy was the little scenes taken directly from the OG show such as Master Pakku seeing his reflection in the ice piece Katara throws at him during their duel, The cabbage guy yelling \"My Cabbages\" etc.To round it off what I'm trying to say is while the storyline is alright, they have ruined the depth and personality that made many of the characters who they are and that had profound impacts on them throughout their journey and helped shape their development throughout the story. The fact the OG show creators left citing Netflix not following their vision for it just drives the point home.In terms of visual and sound effects the show shines. Seriously this is by far the best part of the show, which is kind of sad since I was hoping to be praising the acting, casting and story more than VFX and SFX. The sound effects and theme song are all actually really good, no real complaints there. The visuals are also really great to see and look awesome. There is a reason you see most instagram clips and stuff praising the VFX\/SFX.With all that praise heaped on the VFX and SFX there is one thing I have to comment on and that is the god awful costumes, wigs and world itself. What I mean by this is very simple, in the 2010 movie what M. Night Shyamalan was able to do very successfully was make a world that looked and felt real, the characters wore outfits and clothing that felt lived in and worn and the wigs used all looked and felt natural and real. In the show none of this is done unfortunately, the wigs look fake and just plopped onto the actors head, the clothing all looks and feels fake for lack of a better word, like it's not been lived in or used in real life at all and the world itself screams of tons of CGI without the authenticity that M. Night Shyamalans world brought to us in terms of it's looks and feel.The final thing to talk about is the bending styles and I'm sorry to say but it is absolutely terrible. I don't know what they were thinking when they decided to go ahead with these but they are all literal copy and pastes of one another and it sucks that they all look the same. The OG avatar has each bending style based of a different martial art with the 4 being Tai-Chi, Hung Ga, Baguazhang and Northern Shaolin which results in really cool looking and unique bending styles for each element. Unfortunately the live action show completely throws this out the window.Overall I will give the show a 6\/10 as it's got brilliant VFX and SFX thanks to 2024 technology as well as quite an accurate cast and some cool scenes taken straight from the OG animated show. There are also a few really well done acting performances that I enjoyed. However it loses 4 stars for the overall wooden acting, lack of personality and character development as well as the terrible bending forms and mishmash of a storyline. Still if you are someone whose never seen anything Avatar The Last Airbender before then definitely give the show a watch (Or the movie since the storyline won't effect you then having not seen anything ATLA related before) if you want something live action otherwise go watch the OG animated show.","rating":"6\/10","date":"27 February 2024"}
{"title":"Horrible Casting","review":"The story and effects r really great. The most devastating disaster are the actors. It seems like they have opted for the cheapest cast available in the talent market. Horrible screenplay and editing. The casting and the blooming love stories are just too much to handle. Just a wasted opportunity with such a great story and current technology. The expression less actors make it a horrible watch. Eventually one gives up, as there is no connection happening with the screen life. Its such an iront that the cast director found every actor which is at their worst. Cant stand anymore, E3 is the farthest i could go.","rating":"2\/10","date":"27 February 2024"}
{"title":"Sadly Katara and Aang were the weakest part in the entire show (spoiler free)","review":"I have seen everything Avatar when i was a kid. It is one of the best animated tv shows from my childhood. In this live action adaptation, there were some characters who looked nothing like the original, especially Azula and one of her teammates which was a massive letdown (i can live with that). The story was presented differently with some changes but i had no problem with that as well. The scenery, action, everything that is visual was great. Sokka, Zuko, Iroh... etc., for the most part almost all actors in this show (but not all) did a great job portraying characters i enjoyed back then. Sadly, one of the biggest drawbacks of this show were Katara and Aang, first two of the three main leads who should be the foundation that make this show so memorable, characters who were one of the most important ones in the animated version. Their acting was stiff here, it lacked heart and soul, like watching someone read from a teleprompter. There was no flow in their movement, they held back a lot and maybe even did not truly know the characters they were portraying.I can see why episode 6 was well received, there was more good acting there that felt genuine because there was no Katara and less of Aang. I actually shed a tear while watching it, thinking what a missed opportunity, if only everyone took their roles so seriously. I don't want to hurt anyone's feelings but if season 2 were to happen, if it does get a green light to continue with another season... My advice for these 2 actors would be to do their research, especially if you get roles as important as this. In the original animated version, Aang was more loose, happy-go-lucky, all over the place and did not just stand there like a plank. This is an adaptation of an animated series, don't be afraid to move more and show some energy even if you fear you will look ridiculous, because that's what Aang was like for the most part in the original animated show. And Katara, she was more like a mother figure, nurturing, caring but also had fire in her, flipping out at times and showing her frustration. She was definitely not as motionless, dull and forgettable as she was here. I don't recall seeing anything like this before, where (almost) everyone else is great and one of the most important characters of the show are now the weakest. I know i can't put all the blame on these actors, whoever cast them and the director should also do better in the future. I hope they all learned from this and do better next time. I'm sure if they care enough, they can turn this around.I believe in second chances so i will give these two actors i mentioned the benefit of doubt if they are fortunate enough to be able to continue portraying these characters again. If only all these problems were noticed sooner, this could have been a great adaptation and if it needed more time, i would have gladly waited another year or two.","rating":"6\/10","date":"26 February 2024"}
{"title":"Way to many comparisons to the animated series","review":"First off I've seen a lot of stuff comparing the humor not being there. For one it's not an animated series directed towards children. The show has humor just not over the top animated humor. I think the humor is perfect for a live action Show. Imagine it just being goofy like the animated, it wouldn't be much of a new show. The do a great job keeping the show as original as they can without just copying the animated Series. I feel like the characters are pretty spot on with the acting. One of the best live action remakes in awhile. Living to the hype like one piece live action. Give me hope for other live action shows.","rating":"10\/10","date":"23 February 2024"}
{"title":"Initially hated the show, but it has grown on me","review":"At the start of this review, I have to make amends. I initially rated the show 4 stars, after seeing 2 episodes. I just didn't like the general 'feel' of this show. Castings were wrong, costumes where wrong, dialogues were horrible. Yet, I did continue to watch the show. An now, after giving it a few weeks of thought, I've realised my initial rating was unfair. This show shouldn't be compared to the original comic. Its not written to please the old fanbase, who is now in their late 20s l\/early 30s. This show is aimed at today's kids. And: it's a kids show, not an adult show. And should be reviewed as such. I still don't like the casting and the costumes. Everything just feels 'off' and unrealistic. But it's not intended to look like it could be a real historical setting, like GoT or similar shows. And truth be told, the dialogue improves as the show moves on. The scenario still is weak, but then they had to condense the 20 episode long story of the cartoon into 8 episodes for this show. Which they actually did quite well. Is it a great standalone show? No. Would it have attracted the same hype if the original cartoon didn't exist. Probably not. But it is a decent child's show with stunning graphics, and the bottom line of the story is still as strong as ever. 7\/10.","rating":"7\/10","date":"12 March 2024"}
{"title":"has it's flaws but extremely beautiful \uf8ff\u00fc\u00f2\u00e7","review":"I went into this show knowing it couldn't match the original and I'm glad I did because it really helped me enjoy this version. I'm going to list my pros and cons of this show.Cons\n1. Too much exposition in the first episode: they did more of telling than showing like gran-gran telling the entire history of the war and letting Aang find out about the death of the air nomads too early\n2. It felt a bit rushed\n3. Aang not bending water once in the entire show.Pros\n1. Loved the visuals of this show it really felt like I have been transported into this beautiful word of Avatar2. Zuko. He was already my favorite character in the animation and Is still my favourite in the live action. In fact I dare say the live action did a better job showing Zuko than the animation. I loved how they made the 41st division his crew and how they bowed down to him when he came back.3. Showed the reality of what war can do to a person. In the show Bumi was all loving to Aang when he came back, which is fine since that was a kids show but in reality such a person would be angry. Seeing your city suffer because of a senseless war and the one person who could stop it was your friend and to the best of his knowledge he felt like his friend abandoned him.4. Showing the air nomad genocide. We know they died but we never got to see how they died and seeing this was so sad and really showed how much was at stake for Aang.5. I loved seeing Avatar Kyoshi and Avatar Kuruk. I knew little about the two of them now I get to see some of their back story\nThey are so many things good to say about this show but for now this is all I could remember off the top of my head but I really enjoyed this show. Its will probably be among some of the best shows i have watched this year. I pray we get a season 2. There's so much room for them to improve. The hate this show is getting is uncalled for at worst this show is a 6\/10.","rating":"8\/10","date":"27 February 2024"}
{"title":"Glaring omissions are all I can focus on","review":"So let me just say, this is a pretty decent live adaptation. I felt like the acting is fine, the casting was great, they did well with the bending. There were some good fight scenes and some poor ones (to be expected though. Not every fight scene can be a banger. They require choreographing, practice and practical execution. Probably really tough when held up against a cartoon that can literally do anything. So I'll give a pass on that).But for the life of me, I just don't understand why Netflix feels the need to do everything in 8 to 10 episodes... seriously, stories that need to be told should be free of constraint. I thought the shift from cable to internet streaming would FREE US from these constraints. Where a 30 minute time slot needed to be filled with 18 to 20 minutes of actual cartoon, and end precisely so the next time slot could push their ads as well, internet streaming means this old model would go away. I would actually appreciate it if there was some variation in the length of episodes. It just doesn't make any sense to cram them into time frames that are arbitrary. What I had two hopes for this show going in that I knew were unrealistic and wouldn't be met and they weren't. 1) that this would be almost word for word recreation that captures the soul of the original. 2) even expanding on this world and giving us some new unseen adventures that can give the old show new life. These are pretty much contradictory and I realize that. Seriously, Netflix has the budget to go out on something as sacred as the last air bender. This show proves to me they just want us to sit down and tune into Netflix, they don't care if we actually like it.I've seen some comments on here saying things along the lines of \"well at least they cut the unnecessary filler\" and I think maybe I'm just sensitive to that because I love the original show so much, I don't think any bit of it is unnecessary or filler. I'm disappointed they cut out entire episodes like the canyon crossing, the imprisoning of earth benders who rise up and fight. Why even recreate a show if you're going to leave so much out? These things gave so much depth to the characters and story. Like I said, you can give variation to episode lengths. If you feel like those things are filler, don't cut them, just keep them in as 20 minute episodes true to how they were made. It's also disconcerting that they included things from season 2 of the original show in this shows season 1.... Lovers pass to Omashu was on their way back to omashu before they find out it's conquered by the fire nation. So now what happens in this shows season 2? They're gonna fly in? There was a reason they went through the tunnels, they were trying to lie low. Small details from the show were ignored. The fire lord's face wasn't revealed until season 2. There were some powerful lines that were just not included. Some action sequences missed some opportunities, like the giant ocean spirit didn't slice ships... that would've been so cool live action. With all these negative things stacked up, it just makes me wonder.. why? Why even make this if it isn't true to source? Why constrain yourself to arbitrary time limits and episode numbers? Why did this take so long to come out if this is all we got?The good stuff does stack up too. The casting was great. The acting was a bit cheesy but I was hoping it would be. The original show had so much humor and charm, cheesy acting is welcome. Uncle Iroh, Zuko, Aang, Firelord Ozai, Suki were perfectly cast. Katara and Sokka were okay. Yuwei was a good actress but a bad wig. There's really only one casting decision I'm not pleased with but I'm not gonna say who it was or why. These are mostly kid actors and they do get affected by what is written about them. Look at the backlash at that Asian girl from Star Wars. It was unnecessary. I hope these kids grow in these rolls and take things to the next level with each coming season. I think there's still hope for things to come. At the end of the day, this show doesn't take anything away from us. We can always go back and watch the original. So while this wasn't the best it's not like I lost anything. I just think it's a bit sad Netflix is so okay, if not comfortable, with mediocrity. 7\/10!","rating":"7\/10","date":"25 February 2024"}
{"title":"Some flaws, but the potential for greatness in future seasons","review":"It is difficult to adapt a beloved show. If the original is really great, in a sense, the adaptation can only be worse.This adaptation is miles above the movie that-shall-not-be-named, but it still disappointed many fans. I understand that. Some of it is just nostalgia. The avatar animated show was amazing, but season 2 and 3 are when it really took off. Season 1 was good, with great moments, but not yet a masterpiece. So a lot of expectations were too high and probably unreachable.At the same time, comparisons are unavoidable. The show was allowed to make changes: take a different tone, change the episode format, etc... But knowing the great source material that was available in the animated, some choices are still baffling.Overall, the show did many things really well. The visuals, first, were amazing, with few exceptions. From the sets and costumes to CGI landscapes and bending, it was really both beautiful and faithful to the world. The action was often good or great. Most importantly, it had its heart in the right place.The issues start to appear in the plot. This show tried to keep many story beats from the original, but in only 8 episodes, that meant mashing together many plotlines together. This more often than not failed, rushing through too many things at once. The show was at its best when it let one a single plotline breath into a full episode. If future seasons are adapted, I hope they dare to cut more (or even better increase the episode count, even if this means higher budget).The constant rush is probably part of the reason we never get to really enjoy the Gaang, either individually or as a group. We see too little of their dynamic, as they are often split apart to follow different plotlines. And individually, we simply have too little of them being them, instead focusing on them doing things to move along the dense plot. Their flaws are mostly removed, reducing their space to grow. Their personality is more often that not explained instead of being shown. Hearing \"I like goofing off\" does not quite give the same effect as actually seeing a character goofing off. Zuko and Iroh are the only ones to really get meaningful character moments. Since characters were arguably the strongest point of the original, it is sad to see this.At the end, is it a pleasant show? Yes, I think so. But I don't think the quality was here to bring new viewers to think \"this was a masterpiece\". For me, it is a solid 8. Once I removed my expectations, I enjoyed the show, and some episodes, episode 6 in particular, really gave me high hopes for the future.If netflix greenlights more seasons, which I really hope, I think the potential is there. If the writers can learn from this season, give more time for our characters to shine, start showing instead of telling, and otherwise keep the visual quality and the obvious care they had for the show, I think we COULD have a masterpiece.","rating":"8\/10","date":"1 March 2024"}
{"title":"S1 They really nail the micro details, but miss the macro ones.","review":"The series has great bending effects and visually looks like the cartoon, comics, and novels it's based on. This is avatar but live action and the first season will give you that. However the show likes to have aspects of the cartoon while missing the point of why they were in the cartoon to begin with. I feel like Katara and Aang act both like the Katara actress from the play at the end of the cartoon series. Lots of talking about ideas without doing them. Zuko was pretty good.Below are some minor details it nails with macro ones it doesn't.The detail that Zuko's ship crew is made of the soldiers he got his scarred for standing up on their behalf is fantastic. A+But Zuko didn't pick them. His father said (paraphrasing) \"listen baby if you want to protect your baby soldiers so much why don't you just marry them! Take the baby soldiers and leave.\" Zuko didn't save the soldiers his father saved them. (C-)Only being able to summon past avatars at their shrines is a good nerf to help explain why Roku couldn't do everything for Aang in the original cartoon. (A-)Aang doesn't waterbend in the entire season. In the cartoon the first season (Water) (which covers the same events) is about Katara and Aang learning waterbending as they travel to find waterbending masters at the north pole. (D)Azula and Zhou going behind Zuko and Ozai's back for there own glory is fantastic. (A)Every scene with Aang involves him saying (paraphrasing) \"sorry avatar avatar responsibility avatar duty sorry, but I need to do that now by helping people\" he then does that helping people maybe 10% of the time after saying that. Aang is constantly talking about doing things and rarely does things. (D)Ozai is hard on Azula commenting that Zuko could still become firelord. Ozai wants Azula and Zuko to be enemies to make them both fiercer and to fight for his loyalty. (Great writing) (A+)Team Avatar is constantly talking about how friendship makes them stronger, but they don't feel that close to me. They feel more obligated to be on this journey rather than genuinely enjoying each other's company. Being in a team makes them stronger but I don't think they like each other. (Strangely needs more marvel Whedon banter between friends) (D+)","rating":"7\/10","date":"23 February 2024"}
{"title":"Let's hope the best for next seasons","review":"Avatar: The Last Airbender is a tv series full of love for the original material and it appears clearly. There are many changes compared from the animated series, but all of these are for good and well introduced in the show. The most beautiful thing of the animated series are characters and how they are pictured. In this live action adaptation, every main character is interesting and well showed. In general, the product is very good, the trio Aang, Sokka and Katara works well and many things are well settled for the next seasons. Overall, An excellent remake of the original and the VFX was insanely good.","rating":"10\/10","date":"24 March 2024"}
{"title":"An hour each eps and what was gained?","review":"I had zero expectations for this show, before the release I didn't look up the trailer or actors just so I'll be \"surprised\" and give an honest objective review and I'm glad I had zero expectations because if I did have any I would've been sorely disappointed. Not to say it's bad, it's definitely not bad, it just doesn't give you the lvl of hype that so many ppl had for it. I understand why the original creators abandoned the project cause I would've too. To start off with what wrong: they said the target audience was the original viewers but they treated us like we were children incapable of critical thought, I cant get over how many important points were being delivered in random lines and how everything was so over explained (it was like they had nvr heard of show don't tell). Whereas the animation had left us ponder on so many deep topics here there's no room to explore and learn, what are the motifs, what are the lessons. Moving on to costume: it was giving cosplay, I actually had to pause and laugh when they showed yue and azula's crew cause what were they wearing. Even aang's fit was questionable and ik they wanted to copy source material but they failed to do that in so many aspects they might've well switched the fit since it looked cheap and laughable. Storylines: I'm not mad that they combined some storylines I think it makes it easier for another season but the storyline becomes iffy when they starts to mish-mash episodes, it got messy and lacked sense ex:episode 3 was rushed character plots. Why was the cave of two lovers in season 1, why weren't aang and Katar in love (the age gap between characters messed it up and ik they wanna hold tight to him being 12 but in the show it doesn't seem like that at all, they could've made him a lil older. If aang knew the northern water tribe was gonna be attacked n he was showed that vision why were they not in a rush to go from the beginning, they were taking their time which made no sense (the vision shouldn't have been included so early on). Biggest problems are pace, tone and characters. Idk how the actor for aang got that role because he struggles to say lines comprehensively, katara's potrayal set feminism back at least 4-5 years, they clearly didn't understand her at all, where was her anger, passion, leadership, parental drive, they forgot it was her anger that released aang from the iceberg in the first place, they made her so docile and soft. A character like that won't be able to bloodbend in the upcoming seasons. Iroh and the side characters (Jet, zhao, the mechanist,suki) were more interesting to watch than everyone else and that's an issue. The bending was slow, it only got better when I replayed it in 1.25x speed cause then it actually flowed. Katara's battle with Pakku was underwhelming and became easily forgettable. Gyatso vs Sozin was also underwhelming. I liked that they introduced each avatar n kyoshi's fight but I couldn't understand why in the world she was constantly yelling at aang, she's dominant, yes but angry, no. I also didn't understand why aang didn't waterbend at all whatsoever during the entire season, a major plot was supposed to be katara's anger\/jealousy that something she trained for her whole life could come to aang so easily and we didn't see this. The original movie in terms of acting, script were horrible. But in terms of the Wardrobe, shots, color grading and the locations were far better in the movie. If ppl wanna settle I think that's fine, but unfortunately the show doesn't give what I thought it should've for the budget and the time.","rating":"6\/10","date":"23 February 2024"}
{"title":"Just no.","review":"Save your time and energy. Absolutely bent over all the original characters with any depth and spanked them as hard as they could and stripped them of anything of value (iroh, zuko, azula, sokka, katara) . Terrible casting on a lot of characters as well (azula, mai, yue) . And some just really terrible acting from some of the cast (aang, katara). Aang lacks a lot of his childlike wonder and he's constantly sulking and brooding around. Katara is somehow a master without training from any real waterbenders. Azula is a deeply insecure girl vying for her father's attention and approval and in competition with zuko (azula was ALWAYS better. She was never insecure because she knew she would always win.). What happened to the calculated and icy girl we knew? Iroh could be taken out of the tv show entirely and you wouldn't really notice a difference. Which is huge. Iroh is a big component in the original of how things flow and bring about zukos development. Somehow iroh is now just an old man that seems to add nothing. The line he said in Omashu \"for the fire nation!\" Really left my head turned. I don't understand what they were trying to do with him. Honestly could've left him out and it would've been the same. Why did they feel the need to combine certain things from season two into an already condensed season one? Why is the owl there? Why is Yue a three tailed fox? Why does gran gran have veneers? Lots of strange and head scratching things. Don't even get me started on the wigs and the outfits. My high school drama class could've pulled better outfits and hair together than this hot piece of garbage. I didn't expect hardly anything, but I really didn't expect them to fumble everything THIS bad.","rating":"4\/10","date":"13 March 2024"}
{"title":"Had to watch it forcefully just to see much they screwed up the chacters","review":"Great fan of original, so had to watch forcefully. Felt so bad watching the series. Most I disliked was how they made Aang so serious and not to even try any other things on his own and relay on his team. Katara has lost the charm of being what she was in original a teacher, mother etc. Sokka has lost the quirkiness. Hard to like new Irroh, too jaded. Original series was great because of all those lovable characters and each one had their attitude they carried around ehich is totally missing here. No issues with the graphics and presentation. Think Netflix tries too hard to saturate everything and being right.","rating":"","date":"29 February 2024"}
{"title":"Its not bad, but it's not great either.","review":"Overall I did like the show. Some of the additions were very well done and were definite improvements.But while it didn't really feel rushed, it was messy and overall felt a bit hollow.They did very well with most of the actor choices look and voices. But too often they were completely missing those nuances that made them feel like the original characters, which made the animated show so good.The show did look and sound amazing.Maybe they tried to force feed too many things? Might have been the lack of taking time to let the characters be and live, on their trip half way around the world.But, If \/ when I was to watch Avatar again, It'll be the original instead. Though I'll be watching season 2 of this new version when it comes out. The issues with season 1, shouldn't be hard for them to remedy in the second season.","rating":"7\/10","date":"23 February 2024"}
{"title":"Engaging","review":"Now first and foremost, I have never watched the 'cartoon\/anime\" series, so this may put me at a disadvantage by some, however, in my defence, it gives me a perspective away from what those that know...\nThe young actors in this series are somewhat wooden and are less engaging with the audience, the dialogue is somewhat delivered without conviction or emotion, however, the storylines resonate throughout, without preaching to the converted or any preconceived ideas.Each episode presents a issue\/problem that is surpassed by simple human logic and emotional growth, showing the audience that any obstacle can be overcome by interacting with friends and colleagues on a human level and even understanding the 'enemy' with empathic thoughts.Thoroughly enjoyed... this should be seen by parents and children with a discussion emphasizing the joys of friendships overcoming adversity.","rating":"8\/10","date":"1 March 2024"}
{"title":"A faithful effort that cannot hide its flaws.","review":"Season 1 review.While not an awful show. Its pacing and writing leaves much to be desired. Its over use on exposition to tell the story for us instead of showing us through character building and world building and emotion is sadly a big determent to the show.Otherwise a great cast, many of who bring some great or good chemistry with the material given when its given, as well as looking and staying faithful to the source material. Great bending effects, special effects are decent and not distracting, got a few laughs and smiles from some of the humour too.There was potential in this show but its let down by those issues I mentioned. It's biggest task was trying to measure up to the original, although it tries in many places sadly it fumbles in a lot in the key areas of the show as mentioned.Trying to take myself out of the mindset of the original and look at this Netflix show in its own bubble, this show may still have issues in its lack of character and is overuse of exposition and its pacing which may be off putting to some.If you haven't seen Avatar the Last Airbender I say watch the original cartoon which seems way more adult in places than this show, but there's no reason why you cannot watch this either, you may find something to enjoy here, there is love and care within this show, its not completely devoid of anything worthwhile, there is a level of charm and character in places. Sadly its just let down and hampered by those things already mentioned. Watch at your own risk I say.","rating":"6\/10","date":"25 February 2024"}

Visually good and the acting is an 7\/10. But no way a show like this would have a 10\/10 for what it is. If you saw this show first before ever having seen the original animation, you would have loved this show. So on that premise... it's a 10\/10. Dont be so quick to nit pick. Loved this so far for what it is. The action was awesome!!! And the animation for the bending was way better than expected as well.

{"title":"You will never like this as much as the original","review":"I mean, as my headliner says, the biggest problem for me wasn't the story telling or characters. The problem was that I'm so big fan of the original that nothing in this world can grew past that, its perfect in every way so it's hard to judge this swoh properly, you just compare the two and the original ofc wins. But this show did alot of things right for me and some not so right, for example the attack of the air temple is great addition and I absolutely love how the Zukos actor plays the character, Zuko absolutely nails every scene he's in and does phenomenal job, also (Ozais actor is perfect and the character also is done so well).Things I don't like, firstly the actors playing Azula and Ty lee, it just doesn't feel right, Azula has no charisma or the maturness you get from her in the og and the problem with this actor choise is that when in the original you see Azula you go \"omg we will die if we don't leave now\", this Azula gives more of a \"oh look this girlie is mad what can we do\", the problem with the charisma missing, Ty lee isn't sexy or attractive like why?, this is literally her whole character arc, being this attractive bimbo that knocks hundreds of earth bending soldiers. Also there sre problems with the story telling and stuff like that but you can't make a realistic replica of the original so I'll let it pass. Overall I enjoyed the show but it's not perfect.","rating":"7\/10","date":"25 February 2024"}

I was worried in the beginning that they would either stray far from the original or just make a carbon copy and ij both cases I would have asked: what is the point of this show. But they really surprised me. They changed juet enough to make it super fresh and not too much so that we still recognise it as an adaptation. I really don't care what people thinking about this , but I absolutely loved it ! Bravo !","rating":"10\/10","date":"23 February 2024"}
{"title":"Great, but nowhere near the original","review":"Pros:\nNetflix The last airbender had all the essential elements in it, but it felt too rushed. Great visualizations and good casting. They nailed some of the characters in the show, in my opinion Kyoshi, Suki, June and Jet. Kyoshi was a fan favorite back then, so no surprise they did her so well in the show. Suki looked like her animation version and acted like her animation version. June and jet did pretty well too. Sokka was genuinely still funny and looked like him, especially with the hair pulled down.Cons:\nThe characters development was very weak compared to the animation. Sokka for example. In Atla, even though he has some goofy moments at points, he is still incredibly smart and a determined person. He is steady and won't give up until he truly thinks he can't win. And when this happens, he learns from the situation and think of a way to overcome it. He is the indirectly leader of the avatar gang, and has moments where his instincts saves the team. This was heavily undermined in Natla. In Atla for example, he trusted his guts and thought something with Jet was off. He investigated on his own, because Katara and Aang were blinded by Jets \"freedom fight\" and how cool he was. His guts were right and he ended up saving a village from drowning. In Natla Jet basically tells Katara what he wants to do, even though civilians are going to die. Sokka found some bombs in the mountain but other than that, it seems like it was Katara vs Jet, not Sokka vs Jet.Katara used to be a steady and eager person. She wasn't afraid to scold the others when feeling frustrated. She kinda had a mother role for the others, and was often the person who bought food from the markets and cleaned the clothes. She doesn't have the same fierce spirit anymore, and it genuinely feels like kids who just have all the freedom in the world and aren't supposed to save the world. The acting was kinda meh, with much less emotions.Aangs role. Like Sokka does Aang have a pretty goofy side. We know that he thinks of his responsibilities, but he is still a kid. When he sees fun, he wants to explore it. Riding on the dragon fish, riding on penguins, attacking Zuko while riding a penguin xD, playing the air sport at the air temple, sliding down of Omashu with king Bumi and many other small funny moments. Natla version of Aang is a lot more \"mature\". He needs to save the world and people is telling him he failed all the time. The balance is off in my opinion. But loved that he went for a slide in omashu with Bumi, this is exploring his goofy side and I hope more will come on the next seasons.And can someone tell me why they did Roku like that? He used to be a wise old man, lived nearly a century with peace and visited all the nations multiple times. He had great wisdom and some form of intimidation, like every time he popped on the screen, we know that something will happen or he had something important to tell. But in Natla, it felt like he just was some drunk spiritual man, who just had a connection to aang for no reason. The show made a greater connection between Aang and Kyoshi and it felt like she was the previous avatar and the mentor of Aang.I felt it was a good season all in all, but the details in the animation are on another level. I had high expectations for the series, since I've watched the show many many times and I can see why people like it so much. Great cgi and great costumes and designs. But the things that I miss is the balance between all the goofy stuff, the seriousness, the sad parts, the well structured story telling, and the characters complexity. The thing that makes Atla so great is that it's character driven instead of plot driven. I hope we see more character complexity the next season.","rating":"6\/10","date":"9 March 2024"}

I love how they dig more into azula's story and give a lot of attention to her reltion ship with her father. It makes her a believable charachter with real motivations.

I find it interesting how different episode elements are mixed together, like Jet or the Mechanist in Omashu, June with sirshu in the fire nation temple. Even if its for cornercutting, so miser netflix can dump episodes to save money. But the series feels rushed, maybe because of this. Still, this \"Alternate Reality\" vibe is there, and its great.The best thing this series could deliver are the\n-Zuko and the 41st division addition\n-The Kyoshi fight scenes done well, the actress did a good job, even her eye movement was b4d4ss.The worst things ?-Lot of important characters are FAT, and look weak, so huge percentage of actor choises are terrible...

The remake Aang was overplaying the \"serious acting\" and even if he was going add the goofy trait it'll seem forced, as the all around acting seems anyway.The CGI isn't all the way horrible but in a lot of scenes it's unbearable to notice it being used.(Same with the green screen affect)I had high hopes for this remake but I guess some things are better off ANIMATED.(this is my first review btw)","rating":"4\/10","date":"13 March 2024"}

{"title":"A mix of good and bad","review":"I watched the cartoon series a few years ago and absolutely loved it. So much fun, so many nice moments filled with emotions, and so many good action scenes. When I heard Netflix will do a live action series, I could only hope that the writers will stay true to the original story and not mess things up, as they usually do on Netflix. And as expected, Netflix dissapoints again. Don't get me wrong, the show would probably be good for someone that does hasn't seen the original. But for a hard core fan, it's lacking many essential moments.To begin on a positive note, here are the things that I liked about the show:Visual effects (fights and landscapes) were really well doneMore action than I expected (considering how expensive visual effects during fights must be)They captured the emotion of the original show really well in some scenes. My favorite was the reveal of Zuko's banishing reason to the crew.I liked that they did not focus that much on the silly jokes that happened in the original show. They delivered enough jokes to showcase the childish mindset of the main characters, but overall kept a more serious note which I think it's justified considering the tragic losses everyone has suffered.Things that bothered me:Aang does zero waterbending, and the first book is called \"Water\". He was supposed to be very good at water bending when he got to the final battle. This is the absolute worst change they made in my opinion. Aangs parallel learning with Katara and them helping each other in the learning process was a major plot in the original series. How can you not bring this into the show?Not enough is explained about the comet. Like, that is one of the most important things in the entire show, it should have been explained from the first episode, and they failed that miserably.There is no explanation about the Avatar learning process, such as the elements are supposed to be learnt in a particular order, what happens if you die in the avatar state, etc.Some casting choices... Yue and Mai look like nothing they did in the animated series.I am curious how they will approach the continuity issues they created in the second season, if there will be a second season.@Netflix: you are not allowed to mess up this series. You hear me? Get your best writers on it and be faithful to the original materials. Or else, we (the hard core fans), will have no mercy on you.","rating":"7\/10","date":"25 February 2024"}
{"title":"They did not Soh-ka it.","review":"The original series is my favorite TV show ever. Asking the Netflix series to be as amazing as the original would be like asking for a grandma that's better than the one you had growing up, it will never happen. This show can mimic and modify, but my hope was that it wouldn't butcher. I do have my criticisms, but overall I thought it was quite solid.I began episode 1 unconvinced that I would make it to episode 2, but soon I wound up watching the entire first season. Right away the tone of the series is quite a lot darker then the original. The show is structured to be less funny and while I find the drama to fall by the wayside just a little bit, it is still funny and sad when it needs to be, and it benefits from epic action sequences, and higher stakes. The lookalike actors, costumes, and cities are impossible to scrutinize, and I got tears in my eyes regularly from the love that went into rendering the anime into live action. The show reimagines the story, and adds a few plot elements that I now wish were in the original. They also added more backstory to some of the characters, and delve further into the lore that is only seen in the spinoffs. It may be less lovable than the original, but there is still a lot to love.There were some issues that I took with this show however. While there is a good amount of talent in the child actors, they can't convince me like the cartoon can. The episodes are triple the length which results in telling as many as three episodes at once. While this works well at story driven times, it's awkward to see them combine The King of Omashu, Jet, and The Northern Air Temple all into one episode. They also cut some lesser but still good episodes. I was also bothered by a few character changes, Bumi is jaded, Ozai is louder and less calculated, and Azula needs to be a complete &$@#%. There were also instances where it wasn't edited well, and it felt like the characters were talking about something that happened in a deleted scene, though I never had an issue catching up with the plot.Don't go into this show expecting it to be the original, it's not that good. I recommend the original to those who have never seen Avatar, and recommend this to the fans of the original series. This show uses fan service smartly, and you can take the good out of it, and use it to improve a few blank pages of the original. The anime holds no surprises for me anymore, and this is a fun way to re-experience it for the first time. I look forward to season 2. Any fan with an open heart will really enjoy this.\"It's like the hermit crab, maybe you weren't born here, but you found this empty shell and made it your home.\"Aang, 2005.","rating":"8\/10","date":"27 February 2024"}
{"title":"What I do think about the series","review":"What I don't like about the series is that they didn't really go with the same kind of story for it. They tried to change it, but not to stray too far away from the original story. Also, they make it so the characters don't go to places for the same reasons. For example, they go to the Water Tribe because Kyoshi said so, not to learn waterbending. The book is just the guiding factor, the only reason they go to these places. Aang also doesn't feel like a jolly, happy kid like in the original series and made it like \"I am so sorry for running away and I must repay you\" which made him seem really different. The CGI is good but wasted potential from what I really understand by what the original creators meant by \"We don't want to do the same things twice\" or whatever they said in that video I watched.I don't know anything about the process and how things like this are managed but this feels like to me at least wasted potential and could of been better executed.","rating":"6\/10","date":"26 February 2024"}

Well some stuff has to go; some characters' stories have to be shortened; some side stories have to be abandoned. Oh and we need academy award level acting from teenagers and blockbuster level special effects too. Sorry kids some stuff is not going to make it on the screen and if that is enough for the OG fanboys to riot (which they would have done if all of those things were met just the same) then perhaps they should stay away. Yes in a perfect world this show would be perfect but we don't live in a perfect world.Did they condense? Yes. Are the actors suitable? Yes. Does it look good? Pretty much (but CGI is still CGI). Is it perfect? No, but then again it is better than the film version!","rating":"9\/10","date":"22 February 2024"}
{"title":"Edgier Than Cartoon, Better than Movie","review":"This is deff a different take on the cartoon ATLA. For instance, you see A LOT more death. Nickolodean was very strict of not showing any blood\/death, they wouldnt even say the word kill (we all remember Suki asking Aang if he \"finished the job\" when he vs. Ozai). This live action isnt afraid to show that these characters are in a WAR.The acting was a little difficult to swallow, especially from Katara but with some extra lessons im hoping she improves. Aangs acting is also okay but he tends to jumble the words in his mouth and has difficulting spitting out complete sentences from time too time which could be the result of poor screenwriting. Sokkas is great and his chemistry with every onscreen character is noteworthy. Zuko is promising as well especially as he is such an internally struggling character. The guy who plays Zuko has a huge role to fill but i have faith the guy playing him can do it justice.What i thought was the most interesting was how amazing the side characters were. For instance: Kyoshi, Jet, Suki, the Mechanist, mechanist's son, and June took what little screen time they had and really stepped up, shining above the leads. I was very impressed.A lot of the costumes looked flat out silly, like the earth bending army with their weird bucket hats and ty lee's hair and outfit. I get that they stayed near identical to the tv show with this one but cartoon costumes usually dont translate well to live action.The bending scenes were phenomenal to watch and stuck to the source material in terms of technique, for example, Zuko uses his feet more often in fire bending than the usual fire bender and you really notice this in the live-action. I will say i was disappointed in Aangs bending, aang in the cartoon was a great defensive fighter and in book 1 he outranked and won majority of his fight scenes. In this live action he was like Korra, sloppy and constantly on the losing side. He was supposedly a master airbender but i really didnt see it here, his technique lacked luster.I was mainly disapponted that Aang didnt water bend ONCE in this season (except the final battle but i dont count that cuz avatar state) Aang is suppose to be near a master water bender by the end of season 1. This live action he talks about all the time how he needs to learn waterbending and then when he finally gets to the Northern water tribe he doesnt train at all.The poor kid is just stressed the whole time, everyones beating on him with how he ran away from his problems, which was a cheap shot at causing conflict. I didnt like how Bumi gave him smack of running away, that storyline felt strange and i wish they kept to the source material on Bumi \/ Aangs relationship in the cartoon.Overall, im hoping theres a book 2 cuz id like to see who they cast as Toph and interested to watch the characters develop especially Zuko.Also and huge spoiler, almost killing off Momo nearly gave me a heart attack. Protect Momo for the rest of the series PLEASE.","rating":"7\/10","date":"25 February 2024"}
{"title":"Renew it already!!","review":"In many aspects, this is not even close to the original. In other aspects, however, it is excellent, creative and even better than the original. Avatar: The Last Airbender is a unique series, being very similar and so different than the animation, with creators who clearly loved their job and brought it to a very high level, that can lead to an excellent continuation of 2 more seasons. It's a shame that the creators of the animation left, though, because of their egoism. With their guidance, the series could've been even better than it already is. PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE... Don't cancel it. So much more to do and such awesomeness here already. Can only imagine what the 2nd and 3rd ones would be like.","rating":"10\/10","date":"24 February 2024"}
{"title":"A good enough attempt","review":"To say that I was skeptical of this - would be a major understatement. The writing was on the wall, every sign assured that this is going to be something that would make people remember Shyamalan's adaptation as a good thing.But I was wrong. It's nowhere near that bad. The cast is largely questionable, and I can barely agree with a handful of characters, with some being so bad that they feel like they were cast right off the grocery store. But the costume design and the likeness of at least the main characters - is commendable. Not every actor does their best, but I have to admit that some do, and, as the saying goes: \"they carry the show\". Despite the rest of the cast's cringe performance.Plotwise - this show does take a few liberties, and many of them are actually for the best. They either fill the gaps that were missing in the original's plot - or they better illustrate the canon events. Which is surprising, usually adaptations only make things worseThe fighting scenes aren't exactly great, about half of them are painful to look at, especially in slow motion. But the other half is a decently choreographed stuff that can be pulled off in live action.Overall, however, it's hard to clearly recommend the show. For a die-hard fan it could be insulting on many fronts, and an indifferent viewer wouldn't really appreciate what this live adaptation is trying to show. Particularly because of how laughable certain elements are, and how plain the show looks compared to big budget competition.I could absolutely rate it higher for the plot liberties, plenty of them positively surprised me. But so many weird casting choices... as well as certain casting ideologies related to the Four Nations.... they make it a hard sell that sits somewhere in line next to trash-tier DCU series. One of the strongest points of the original animation is how neutral it was, despite having quite a variety of people. This live adaptation, just like the previous one... isn't neutral.","rating":"6\/10","date":"20 April 2024"}
{"title":"Disappointed","review":"Yes they have tried. But why risk so much on remaking a series with a cult following.Nothing matches. Dialogues hold no meaning, screenplay is slow and lame. It was so lame that I watched whole series on fast forward, trying to find something interesting. None of the scenes have the power to bind you. Its just so easily forgettable. Infact I am forcing myself to see the whole series, just to find something which can make sense.Where is the fun ?Why did they have to cover so much so fast that they forgot about putting soul to this beautiful story.I think they should stop trying to make a live action series on this story and concentrate on getting something animated which is more funny and relatable.I wish it would have been made in a different way.I am disappointed.","rating":"3\/10","date":"23 February 2024"}
{"title":"Fire All the Script Writers Please","review":"Okay, first and foremost and the rest will be filler. Here is a boy brought up in a society of monks. Strict disciplined society. Yet, the boy doesn't care about anyone but himself. Is selfish, conceded, and has no respect for his elders. What the script writers are thinking about are their own kids and most kids in America. Can't they think outside their own little box and that just maybe there are kids that are disciplined, respectful of others, and just maybe want to be someone who cares?The CGI is fantastic of course. The acting is good, but with some a bit flat. The The flying whatever are just stupid and pre-90s. We've seen this a thousand times before. There is nothing new here. The writing is just obnoxious.

The speech of Kyoshi in the island was horribleZhao it's an awkward general. Uncle Iron is not funny too.Azula looks a child and insecure, that's non sense, she never looks at Zuko like he was capable to steal her position.Well but they keep the cabbage guy.","rating":"6\/10","date":"24 February 2024"}
{"title":"Ignore the false fans","review":"I have been a fan of Avatar: The Last Airbender since it first released in 2005. The animated series was a masterpiece, as was its sequel series. And in spite of being a fan of the series than many of its newer fans have even been alive, I still enjoyed this adaptation of the series.The series isn't perfect. It's not a scene for scene adaptation of the original series, but if you want that then go watch the animated series again. It's condensed and compressed for the sake of making a coherent series in 8 episodes. It's a little out of order, and there's some episode beats missing, but if you want the original series, go watch it.The actors feel a little young for what I expected and not all of them are putting out Oscar worthy performances. The only two casting choices I disagree with are Elizabeth Yu as Azula and Thalia Tran as Mai, and I'm not 100% happy with Utkarsh Ambudkar as Bumi, but outside of that they do their absolute best on all fronts.The action sequences are fantastic, with a brilliant adaptation of bending styles. I'm not sure they replicated the real world styles they were based on, but that's not a major issue. The music is sublime, with many beats referring to familiar songs.Was it the same as the original series? No. Should it be? Absolutely not. It's its own adaptation and it's a good one.","rating":"10\/10","date":"24 February 2024"}
{"title":"Condensing is simply not the way to go.","review":"To follow that, I know that making episode by episode playback of the entire animated series is nearly impossible & Netflix's budget wouldn't have been able to support it with most of its funds going towards special effects. However, eight episodes to sum up the entire water chapter is in its own way, impossible. They did the absolute best they can with what they were working with & this series is still something that I am grateful for and had a fun time watching. I appreciated all of the characters making an entrance and the fact that a respectable live adaptation was even made. I, along with so many others, will have some heavy critiquing and will always, out of love for the show, see how it could've been better. Too rushed. Some characters do there animated versions justice, others did not. Original writing team even left after it was changing too much. All in all, much to improve, but I'm not the professional dealing with whatever circumstances they had to deal with. It was a truly enjoyable show and put a smile on my face many times as I was seeing the similarities and even the differences of the show.","rating":"7\/10","date":"25 February 2024"}
{"title":"I WANT SECOND SEASON","review":"I want a second season!I am a big fan of the show and sure the characters were lacking humor and some scenes were merged together as they don't belong and some were left out but it's not that big of a deal. This is literally the best live action ever made and even if it's not the same it's very similiar and I wholeheartedly enjoyed it. I downloaded this app and even left a review just for this show to get a second season because I'd be so sad if it gets too many negative reviews and we won't get a second season. Sure it's not perfect or as you imagined it, nothing ever will be to everyone's expectation.. But it's still awesome and I loved it and I do hope a lot of you like it enough that you'd rather have a second season and watch it then not.

{"title":"Good enough","review":"I like this but just few funny\/humorous action. In animation series, Aang & Saka was playful. I wan to see when Katara & Saka chasing Aang who was held captive by Zuko. They ride Appa, there should be a scene of how they fly Appa. When they met the Earth King, Katara and Saka were given rings, which would bind them like crystal. In this series, that scene does not exist. The episode of being trapped in the spirit realm is also a little different. It should only be Aang & Saka who are trapped in the spirit realm. I think this series should have the art of humor. It's more entertaining than having to make it more serious. Hope the next season is even better.","rating":"7\/10","date":"27 February 2024"}
{"title":"Give it chance!","review":"I'm really happy they made this show. Sure its not as polished as other shows and is still pretty rough, to me what's important is that I look back on it now, and remember it, and treasure each episode. I can't say the same for the 'better' shows out there that I've watched. Netflix's adaption, to me, is worthy of standing alongside (if not closely behind) the show for the love it puts into it. Some people call this soulless, I think they've lost touch with what this show was teaching us in the first place, to be grateful and humbled by the work of others, whether that be the Avatar or a group of passionate creatives... the world's not perfect and more than ever before, it's going through a spiritual decline where we fail to connect with what is important, to instead, focus solely on the appearance of success, much like the Fire Nation.

{"title":"Season 1... Amazing Adaptation!!","review":"Avatar the Last Airbender was one of my favorite shows since it came out. Incredible storyline. Amazing character development. When they announced the live-action tv show, I was a bit on the fence like most. That said, I absolutely went in with the mindset of someone who's seen the story before. The first two episodes definitely hooked me: the graphics, the characters, and oh my goodness... the fight scenes. Everything was amazing and on par with the tv show. Then came the creative differences. I'm pretty passionate about the original show, so I was upset about the Omashu episodes (if you know, you know). However, I kept going and understood, as well as respected, the creative differences that the creators took. No, it is not an exact play by play of the original series. But... they did capture all of the important points of the story. I think the main characters did a wonderful job portraying the original characters. And the writers did an excellent job tugging on heartstrings with the emphasis on Monk Gyatso's influence on Aang, Sokka and Katara's bond, and Uncle Iroh and Zuko's relationship. My rating is only not higher because I felt the journey to the Northern Water Tribe was too rushed, and in my opinion, Aang was less comedic in this adaptation. If I never watched the original series and knew nothing of the characters, this would 1000% be a 10\/10. If you have seen it, I believe it's definitely still worth watching. If anything, the creativity and hard work of the crew was enough for me to watch. The detail of everything was jaw dropping. They honestly did an amazing job with this and I hope to see a second season.","rating":"8\/10","date":"25 February 2024"}
{"title":"It honestly wasn't that bad!","review":"Though this show is a lot different from the orignial (for example this one is a lot more violent and dark than the other and they added Azula a lot earlier that the oringinal) it's very well made and when they changed plots or added things they did it in a good way, they also made Zuko more likable and makes you feel more sorry for him, I however hate how violent it is and even though the orignial is a cartoon it still has action without terrible violence, that's what really docked points off for me, also can I just mention how much I love when Sokka and Momo hug, it's so sweet, overall not the original but a pretty good show!","rating":"6\/10","date":"27 February 2024"}
{"title":"They didn't understand what made the show great","review":"The plot of the animation is great, but the relationships and character development made it a masterpiece. Not enough time is devoted to characters relationships or development in the live action. The plot is also worse but that is excusable given the difficulty of adapting a show like this.An attempt was made to make the show much more serious and dark in tone, they succeeded at the cost of most of the reasons I liked the animation. The serious tone means that it is much more difficult to include the goofy comedy the animation has. Sokka has a couple sarcastic jokes, but without Aang as a foil it falls flat for me. Katara is the biggest tragedy however. In the animation she has genuine excitement about bending and seeing the world, she has a bit of a temper (especially when it comes to Sokka), she has an impulsive side (the water bending scroll), she uses sarcasm frequently (making it obvious she grew up with Sokka). All of that is gone, to be honest most of what made her a fun character is gone.The CGI for the most part is very good, as is the fight choreography, it's cool to see bending done justice in live action. That said, it makes it even more painful to see the characters so lifeless.","rating":"4\/10","date":"24 February 2024"}
{"title":"\"Ok\" adaptation, but a poor show on its own","review":"Leagues better than the movie, but still riddled with problems.Lot of the little moments of enjoyment were just from \"hey I recognize that from the cartoon\".However, by including cameos and plot elements from future seasons (of the cartoon) it also eliminates the purpose\/function of them, since they serve more important roles in their original appearances: the Owl, calendar that predicts the comet & eclipse (will the library even be in season 2?), Ty Lee & Mai (with the audience not even being told who they are), etc.Appreciated the Appa redesign (compared to the movie) but the cast gets very little connection to him. Even less so with Momo, he appears and then is gone throughout the show, aside from his \"near death\" in the final episode.Props to Gordon for giving a good performance, but holy cow Aang is so one dimensional now. Condensing the plot gave him no growth as a bender, and very little in his character. Gyattso giving him guidance as a spirit was a new and interesting touch, but it makes Aang severely less independent. Same with the constant past lives consultations. Not only was making them locked to the shrines a strange choice, but practically every interaction with the past avatars is just them telling him \"You're really important in case you haven't realized that yet\". It seems every episode has him sadly mention how he \"failed to be the avatar\" MANY TIMES.Katara really the short end of the stick too. She gains power really quickly, barely trains, and her grief about her mom takes over a lot of her personality. She declares herself a master at the end, but we get to see very little of that development. Also Aang gets no water bending training.Another notable change is Zhao. Honestly, I'm mixed, because I do appreciate how they made him more of a pathetic clout chaser instead of a threatening individual, but the sometimes the events surrounding his character don't make sense. Making his death extremely underwhelming (being one shot by Iroh) instead of being consumed by the water spirit monster plays into that pathetic-ness, but it's very unsatisfying. (also what was point of the spirit world dagger?)Saving grace is that the acting is good, and the portrayal of Zuko and Sokka's character (even the changes to them). Fights were decent, visuals (specially environments) were amazing. But dialogue and rushed plot distract you from all of that. I understand they wanted to make the live action more serious and less cartoony, but it clashes greatly with the original flow of the show. The adventure and world building appeal of the cartoon simply cant present itself with the limited episode format.","rating":"6\/10","date":"20 March 2024"}

As a reader myself, I don't expect that books-turned-into-movies would be as good as their originals. I felt the same with Avatar. I saw that many people commented how the story felt like it was rushed. While it is true that they have skipped bits and pieces of the characters' stories, I would say that I truly enjoyed watching it. For someone like me who easily falls asleep watching action movies\/animes, I found myself on the edge of my seat throughout the 8 episodes of Avatar. It makes you want more- I was looking forward to the next episode every time one ended.Gordon as Aang was sensational. He embodied the playful and sorta-innocent character. It was very on-point. Dallas captured so much emotions and played Zuko with passion. He played this role by heart. His performance was iconic. I also liked Paul as Iroh. His scenes with Dallas were so brilliant that they made me tear-up than any other scenes from the series. Also, the visuals... where do I begin?! They were gobsmacking! Every time the camera zooms in, you'd appreciate the details of each person\/thing\/background they display. All throughout the series, I kept saying \"that looks so real\".All I can say is this was magnificent work and I am looking forward for another 8-episode series (hopefully more).

{"title":"Rough start but not irredeemable","review":"I watched the entire season in one day together with a couple of my friends and we all came to the same\/similar conclusions. The first couple of episodes were trash but the series got better later on in the season. Some things this series did better than the original but it's held back by a couple of actors missing the mark, a bad script at times and weird pacing. The kyoshi warriors episode is especially bad because Suki seems like she has no social skills, in the original it was a leading moment for Sokka, in this version it's just awkward and very forced. I was also annoyed by most of the settings seemingly having a lot cgi which looks weird with the lighting on the characters, this gives the show a quite fake aesthetic at times.I feel like I have been negative a lot so far so I will now give credit where it is due:\nIt is not a carbon copy of the original, this makes the show interesting to watch.Some of the actors are really good: Ozai, Sokka and Zuko are really good.The elements look really nice, you notice a lot of time was spent on making it look good and having the actors learn the moves.I really hope the show is renewed for a second season, I think that season two will start with a better quality.","rating":"7\/10","date":"3 March 2024"}

Watching this TV show together as a family every Sunday was the highlight of our week, long before streaming services like Netflix existed and allowed us to binge-watch multiple episodes at once. Two decades later, the Nickelodeon team has revived this incredible show, transforming it from animation to live-action heroes within the Earth, Fire, Water, and Air universe. The world is divided into four elemental nations: The Northern and Southern Water Tribes, the Earth Kingdom, the Fire Nation, and the Air Nomads. The Avatar upholds the balance between the nations, but everything changed when the Fire Nation invaded. Only the Avatar, master of all four elements, can stop them. What makes this show truly exceptional is its incorporation of the four elements, which explore real-world themes of love, family, friendship, hate, war, doubt, failure, and ultimately, the triumphs that come from collaborating with like-minded individuals. This show serves as an outstanding professor for both the young and old. Bravo to the teams for their immense effort in bringing this spectacular show to life twenty years later.

Too many poses after speeches given by the characters, that makes it lose the shows realness to it.Sokka is just on point, he feels the best fit, zuko, azula and katara have so many lines that ends with just a unnecessary pose. When the posses are too often it looses its importance to it and makes it like a cartoon.The animals looks great almost real, i like the way they changed and make badgers a bit more violent than the cartoon.

{"title":"Doesn't live up to the memory","review":"I've been watching with someone who never saw the cartoon and it really helped to see it through that view. As a show of its own it's worthy of the rating given (over all and those of 6+). As a \"remake\" live action version it does not do justice to the show. I do however love that they didn't white wash it. What the constructive criticism of the lower reviews are correct about is that the show lacks character development\/depth and the rushed pace of the show. Watching the show as a stand alone it make little to no sense and the scenes are forced into one another making no connection with zero explanation. Since I saw the cartoon I constantly had to fill in the massive gaps.Overall it's just ok. The fact that it's pretty and all the special effects are well done makes this worthy of a watch. With that said it is a terribly sad attempt at a live action version of a cartoon that made so many feel so many emotions. This version evokes no emotions for the characters or story. It's more of a mindless semi nostalgic watch.","rating":"8\/10","date":"9 March 2024"}
{"title":"Better than the movie","review":"Being better than the movie is a low bar to clear. The live action adaptation is enjoyable, the graphics are certainly good, but it really suffers from the condensed eight episode format that is standard these days.Most noticeably in the end, Kamara goes from novice to master in eight episodes, including the two she spends in a coma. We don't the consistent build up of her practicing a couple minutes every episode we just see her suddenly be adept and it just doesn't feel as meaningful.Other areas, like Zuko's persistent hunt, get overshadowed by the Main Plot and also don't seem to mean as much by the resolution.Overall, it's worth watching, it's only eight episodes after all.","rating":"7\/10","date":"26 February 2024"}
{"title":"No, Nope","review":"Did they ever watch the Show? \u00f0\u0178\u2019\u20ac\nLike seriously is it so hard not to mess up something good? The first episode was actually nice but after that it went downhill especially in the Omashu episodes. The Characters are mostly bland and the fun and jokes are completely missing. It feels like they ripped out the heart of the show and that is just sad.I mean it looks good and the effects are okay, I guess.But there is so mutch stuff that does not make sense. How are they planning to do season 2 with this??? Keep the characters where they belong, it's not that hard!!!!!!Sokka is nice though. And I liked the stuff with Irohs son, the soooooong!!!","rating":"4\/10","date":"27 February 2024"}
{"title":"Cringe. Did the directors watch the animation?","review":"I don't think the directors actually watched the animation because they got a lot of things horribly wrong. I was hyped to hear of the live adaptation of my favorite show only to find it difficult to watch. Taking weeks to watch a show of 8 episodes? I'm disappointed. There are no dark skinned characters when it's clearly shown in the animation that there are, lots and lots of them. The actors smh, Zhao was the best played in there, zuko? A bit okay I guess, all other characters were awfully played. I don't know how many times I had to turn away from my screen to escape cringe. The directors could have done better they should have, this had the potential to be one of the best tv shows. I admire the effects and editing, the costumes and setting, these tried to give us the feel of the animation and I loved that but the acting takes a lot away from what could have been a master piece.","rating":"6\/10","date":"16 April 2024"}
{"title":"Faithful adaptation with superb casting!","review":"Fans of the iconic \"Avatar: The Last Airbender\" can rejoice! The new live-action series stays remarkably true to the spirit of the original anime, offering a familiar yet visually stunning journey for all ages. While some liberties are taken, particularly in pacing, the core elements that captivated audiences remain intact. The animation, particularly the bending scenes, is visually breathtaking, capturing the power and fluidity of each element.However, the series truly shines with its exceptional casting. Gordon Cormier embodies Aang's youthful innocence and unwavering spirit, while Kiawentiio as Katara portrays her fierce determination and protective nature with nuance. Ian Ousley brings Sokka's sarcasm and strategic mind to life, adding a touch of humor to the narrative.Though not a perfect adaptation, the series stays close to the source material while offering fresh interpretations. The faithfulness to the original story combined with the captivating performances make this a worthwhile adventure for both longtime fans and newcomers to the world of Avatar.","rating":"8\/10","date":"7 March 2024"}
{"title":"Interesting....","review":"AMAZING start to the show, especially with episode 1 and 2 kicking off with the very spirit of the animated series. However, we can't always expect perfection. When we delve into the Omashu episodes, it all seems too rushed, as well as Team Avatar splitting off into their own little stories, which I personally found quite bizarre, as I always viewed them as character who would stick together and help each other through a problem. It wasn't all that bad though, as I like how Bumi held a realistic grudge against Aang for abandoning the world, which conflicted with his connection with him. When it got to the Hei Bai episode, I was initially struck with horror when I saw Wan Shi Tong introduced. It all seemed too confusing, however we will see what they'll do with this in season 2 (fingers crossed). Although this specific arc seemed to drag on and on, it was still somewhat rewarding in the end. Episode 6 'Masks' was BY FAR my highlight of the entire series, especially where we got some interesting hints into the deeper parts of Ozai's character, where he seemed somewhat regretful when punishing Zuko, however put his ideals on the strong and the weak first. I also loved the whole story with the 41st division being Zuko's crew and how they learned to give him the respect and dignity he deserves. The Siege of the North was a mixed bag, as we got a whole lot deeper into the spiritual history and lore of the Water Tribe than the original, which I loved. However, the fact that Pakku wouldn't train Katara at all, only allowing her to fight when the battle had begun, I found was quite insensitive of Katara's arc. This was worsened even more when Pakku recognised her as a master without any proper training! Not to mention, we don't see Aang train his water bending at all, which I understand was addressed when he talked about being him training to contain his power in episode 2. I also understand that this could have been done to fill in the time skip that has been planned out to fit the growing up of the cast, however I would've wanted to see Aang overcome his fear of hurting others and begin his training at least. Overall, this is a mixed bag, however it would be a shame if the show didn't continue.","rating":"7\/10","date":"24 February 2024"}
{"title":"I was ready to be very critical but I loved it","review":"At first I wasn't sure if I should give it a try since the last failed adaptations, nothing can beat the original one, with its humeur and hopefulness, but this one by Netflix is a really great adaptation of it, I was left happily impressed. Kyoshi Avatar in episode 2 left me feeling that I should finally read that novel about her. Anyway I can't wait to continue watching it. It feels better that the series are moving a bit faster than series, since I remember all the cartoon events pretty well, in that adaptation the story feels different somehow. I like that it's not only focused on Aang since he is only a child with a difficult mission, but around his friend as well.","rating":"8\/10","date":"29 February 2024"}
{"title":"Shouldn't have gotten my hopes up","review":"Ever since DiMartino and Konietzko left this project, I've been cautiously optimistic about this series.Luckily, my only expectation was that it would be better than the Shyamalan movie.While my expectation was met, that was a pretty low floor. And after watching the series in full, I'm willing to say that this series barely exceeds beyond the movie's failure.ATLA is my comfort show. I can watch it over and over again, and still feel inspired and motivated and emotional from its incredible storytelling.I don't even think this series deserves a second watch.While I appreciate the efforts that went into the casting, imagery, and inventive way they were able to weave several episodes into one long episode, it deviated far too much from the source material.It felt like they added depth where it wasn't needed, and subtracted from the parts that made ATLA truly great.For example, Aang and Zuko are the obvious protagonists of the original series . Yet their live action counterparts felt one dimensional. Both were never really developed in a way that the audience would believe that either character was capable of overcoming their challenges.If anything, this series felt like a show about Katara and Sokka. And I almost wish that were true. If you were going to reimagine this series in a new way, a new perspective only seems fitting. Again, those involved with this series seem to be more focused on adding more detail to this universe instead of focusing on what truly makes the story great.Ultimately, true ATLA fans will see the series as a massive letdown. Luckily, we have a new avatar content coming from DiMartino and Konietzko. At least we still have something look forward to.","rating":"6\/10","date":"23 February 2024"}
{"title":"Worthy reimagining","review":"The characters we know and love are recognizable and fully realized in this retelling. They did a fantastic job of keeping the core story in tact, while weaving in homages to side stories that were cut for continuity. Most of the casting is brilliant and where I was a little \"meh\" on a couple characters, even they grew on me. They kept in just enough of the humor of the original for it to still feel like the Nickelodeon story, but amped up some of the darker elements for a more mature take on the tale (while still keeping it within the realm of family-friendly'ish). The locations are breathtaking interpretations of the animated settings. Emotional, beautiful, nostalgic journey. Highly recommend!","rating":"9\/10","date":"16 March 2024"}
{"title":"It was great but VERY confusing","review":"I watched atla way back in 2020 and I LOVED it so much and watching the new series it's.. really confused me. The Omashu episode didn't make any sense with the fact the whole reason why the episode Teio and Sai were in existed was so Aang could think the air nation was still around and living in the air temples. Shoving all of the earth kingdom based episodes in before the water tribe episodes seemed a bit much, shoving them all in the same place just removed all of the adventures that the gaang originally went on in the original show. I understand that this is an 8 episode live action show with about 40-50 minute episodes but the writing is just too crammed in. Seeing Lord Ozai, Azula, Mai and Ty Lee in season one was just as confusing, I would of preferred to see another end of season Ozai reveal like they did with the original show.What I do love is the casting choice, I didn't have high hopes for this new live action after watching the last avatar but when I saw the cast and saw an mostly and all most all Asian cast I was ecstatic, and then when I watch the trailer it also hit me that the actors for Zuko and Sokka sound the same their original characters from the series which was an amazing touch.The VFX was good as well but some of it look too over detailed, like a very expensive animated show. I understand they can't build massive monuments just for movies but I've always noticed that with movies where they do over the top detail for making CGI buildings. But the bending was BEAUTIFUL, so much better then what they did in the last airbender and very well done.I also LOVED the violence, I've always been a violent movie and show fan, and adding that extra touch of violence and merciless fire benders was the cherry on top and made it feel like I was watching a more grown up version of atla. As most fans are adults I did enjoy the fact they are leaning towards a more mature audience.","rating":"7\/10","date":"24 February 2024"}
{"title":"Loved it","review":"If you are expecting a frame by frame of the animated show, this is not it. If you are expecting to see a live version of the character you love, in a story similar to the one of the nickelodeon show, but told differently (as an ADAPTATION), this is it. This is that show.It made me cry, it made me laugh. It showed me the characters I know and love. I saw Sokka, Katara, Zuko, Uncle Iroh, Aang. Even Azula! And Mai and Ty Lee. I loved Suki and the Kyoshy worriors. Now I need more, I can't wait for book 2, please give me Toph, Ba sing se.

{"title":"For new fans: A blast. For old fans: okay\/meh.","review":"Avatar wasn't as bad as most people here spoke of. They did change a looooot of things. The Omashu part was certainly the worst. Katara's expression was always like if she was about to laugh. But Zuko couldn't have had a better actor, he is perfect for the role.The bending effects were great. Osai was flawless and Zhao was the perfect villain. The actor made him even worse than the animation, which is good.There are some flaws and the phase is kind of fast, but nonetheless it is GREAT. Had a blast and cried like a baby on some parts, and uncle Iroh did great too.I really wish someday the producers will respect the creators more and leave them the rightful creative direction, but, on the end of the day its about the numbers.The fighting scenes are EPIC! Thrilling. Great experience overall, recommend for people who have never seen it (the world of Avatar (not the blue ones(this is the real and first Avatar))), and for the old fans, we weren't really expecting much did we?","rating":"7\/10","date":"28 February 2024"}
{"title":"What in gods name is that???","review":"This looks like a fan made youtube film, everything looks cheap, the acting is worse than the shaymalan version. Characters are super dumb, no development. Story feels rushed, pure exposition. No character resembles their cartoon counterpart, they seem to read off the learned script on button. Zukos actor is deffinetly the best and rescues the entire show. We see scenes filling plot holes no one asked to fill. The og series was deeper and more mature, this one relays on cheesy cgi battles, no philosophical agenda behind anything. Kids might like it, remembers me on \"mystic knights of tir na nog\", same cathegory.","rating":"1\/10","date":"22 February 2024"}
{"title":"Not as expected","review":"The series was a success, with impressive visual effects and well-executed bending choreography, unlike the 2010 movie adaptation.The first three episodes had me hooked, but I found myself checking the time during episodes 4, 5, and 6. The last two episodes redeemed the series with their engaging storyline.As someone who has watched the original animated series, I understand that attempting to cover multiple storylines in just eight episodes can be challenging. However, cramming multiple storylines into a single episode did not allow for proper character development or story arc.It seemed odd to me that the character of \"the Spirit of Knowledge\" was introduced in the first season when he actually appears in the second season of the animated series.The character of Uncle Iroh was not portrayed as humorously as he was in the animated series. Instead, Avatar Roku was portrayed as a more humorous character despite his serious nature. Furthermore, some characters' bending powers and subsequent changes in their personalities were not as engaging in the live-action adaptation.Overall, I would recommend this series to anyone who hasn't seen the animated series. However, as a fan of the original, the live-action adaptation did not meet my expectations. I am hopeful that future seasons will be able to capture the same magic as the animated series.","rating":"7\/10","date":"29 February 2024"}
{"title":"I'm proud of this adaptation, and grateful for it!","review":"Honestly it's pretty good (and I've been a diehard fan of the original show forever) The cast is great, the CGI is incredible, the music and humor are there, and the writing is good. They have shoved a few episodes into one to progress the storytelling, but the more I watch the more I like it. Some creative changes as with most adaptations that I don't disagree with as well. Plus they have the actual cabbage cart guy! I'm only halfway through it so far but I'm definitely eager to see how much they stick to the source material. My only really critic is that it does feel a bit rushed as far as character development and relationships building. And Iroh isn't nearly as witty or wise as he should be. Im just glad to have this done well!!","rating":"10\/10","date":"23 February 2024"}
{"title":"Great visuals, hollow writing","review":"Starting with the positives, visuals were great. Bending CGI was a bit weird at times, but overall the scenery, the animations, the fight choreography, costumes etc. Were really good. They captured the world nicely.Negatives, though, are way too much for me to give a higher rating. They dumbed down basically every character, straight up removing core characteristics of most of them. Aang is suddenly the super serious, straight-to-the-point kid who knows he has to get stronger ASAP, but for some reason doesn't even ATTEMPT to waterbend throughout the whole season? Sokka is suddenly a simp, instead of growing and learning that women can also be strong and stand on equal footing with men? Azula is completely butchered, instead of being the confident smart evil princess, she spends the whole season being jealous and insecure because of her brother.I understand that the authors wanted to leave their mark on the franchise, not just make a carbon copy of the animation, but it just isn't done well. Major plot points are left out, dialogues\/monologues are bland and empty, core characteristics are changed or entirely removed. You cannot expect people not to compare the original with the live action when you use the IP's name, and sadly, comparing it just shows how much worse this version is.If you watch the show on its own, without having watched or heard anything about the source material, it may seem like a decent series, but when considering it as an adaptation, it fails in its mission.","rating":"6\/10","date":"25 February 2024"}
{"title":"Some of these 1 star reviews are laughable","review":"People this is not a cartoon. If you can't get past that then just watch the cartoon, they have limited time to tell the same general story. A shot for shot remake wouldn't be interesting because you've literally already seen that version of the show. I saw one moron give this a one because he saw the trailer and the show wasn't diverse enough... it really takes an exceptional level of ignorance to write something like that when there was literally not a single person who wasn't of some ethnic background in the entire show, seriously not one white person. But I digress...This was a fantastic first season, I thoroughly enjoyed it from start to finish! All of the actors did a fine job. I particularly enjoyed Sokka, Iroh, and Zuko. I'm really hoping Netflix gets to renewing it for the final two books so we can keep the same cast moving forward!","rating":"10\/10","date":"23 February 2024"}
{"title":"Good, but mid writing made it not great","review":"The visuals in the show were spot on. The writing definitely missed the mark though. Id say its a decent show, but I really hope they get some new writers for the future seasons. They constantly said things instead of showing them. To a degree that it felt awkward. And it lacked breath. Some lines arent as impactful without taking time to breath between them.Firt example is with Aang in the first episode. Gyatso tells him hes the Avatar, and without a breath Aang is just saying he doesnt want the responsibility. There isnt any emotional timing and there isnt that childlike response you would expect from Aang. Aang in the whole series kind of fell flat tbh.Zuko was great. His actor was great. They missed the opportunity to have him save the 41st division instead of literally ozai. But overall Zuko was the best character. Not disappointed at all.Katara was terrible. Literally a mary sue. Never gets a master. Has a stupid girl boss moment where \"shes her own master\". Dumb. She can be a prodigy, but you only become a master by learning from a teacher. She also has no flaws. Not sure why they chose this when people hate mary sues in all other films.Saka was fine. They got rid of his main sexism arc to only include the sexism at the norther water tribe. So... tell me again why they removed it?Bumi was a complete let down.Jet was surprisingly one of my favorite characters.They shouldnt have included Azula at all. She wasnt even scary. How do you introduce this iconic character and not even make her scary.Overall, yes I have a lot of criticism, but it definely wasnt bad. Just watch more than the first episode. The first episode was the worst by far. The whole show just felt rushed. Like they were forcing the story as quick as possible. And a lot of writing lacked a natural flow. Def not a bad show, just needs better writers.","rating":"6\/10","date":"23 February 2024"}

The 1 star reviews are petty and these people will never be happy until there is a shot for shot adaptation with actors that look and sound exactly like the original series.

{"title":"Fails to understand the true core of the characters","review":"I will give credit where credit is due, this series has good intentions, visuals and settings, decent effects and a pretty okay cast. It has moments that touch your heart wether it be by nostalgia, or a nice character moment. The begining of the series really left me speechless with the amount of violence and stakes they set regarding how menancing and truly horrific the Fire Nation could be.That being said, this series does not land the characters or their interactions as much as the original. This is most notizable with the main trio. While Aang, Katara and Sokka do have an air of their original essence, they lack a lot of the intricate layers that define them as true flawed people. They also lack basic interactions in those first few scenes that make them more proactive characters.I believe that in an effort to make this series more serious, Netflix failed to completely understand the characters from the get go.I'll start with Aang. First let me say the actor playing him is adorable and capable of handling those really heavy scenes as well as the carefree smile at the more lighthearted moments. The issue with him is in the way this character is written so the actor does his best with what he has to work with. This Aang mentions his responsibility as the Avatar almost as much as Zuko mentions Honor throughout the series. It's a LOT. This Aang feels more like the tortured Hero who failed at the start of season 3 instead of the carefree, immature kid who wanted to ride Giant Koi Fish and go Penguin Sledding with Katara. What I mean is, from the get go, this Aang feels like he has a grasp of what happened the last 100 years despite not being there. Even if at times he is shown to have some moments of levity, he is usually back to his RESPONSIBILITY AS THE AVATAR tune the next moment. And just no. Aang is supposed to learn this throughout the season, slowly... and I understand this series is 8 episodes long instead of the usual 20ish, but they could have cut a lot of unnecessary scenes to favor their main protagonist's growth.I'm not of the idea of blaming the actors for a script that at times felt stiff or unnatural, but I am blaming the writers. People... don't talk about their issues from the get go... it's odd. Aang is not given a chance to bond with Katara either. I don't know why this bothered me so much, I'm not even that much into pairings... but the lack of key moments to forge their deep relationship made it feel like Aang connected on a deeper level with Iroh, rather than Katara, whose conversation revolves mostly around, Waterbending stuff.Moving onto Katara... the actress is okay. She is a bit shallow at times. But again I feel this is because the script doesn't allow her to BE Katara. There is one moment in Omashu when Aang notices people suffering and he's like \"I have to help these people it's my responsibility as the Avatar...\" and Katara is like we have to get to the North Pole and I had to pause the video because NO. Katara doesn't want to help people? She wants to go to the North Pole? Nononono, sir, Karata 'I will never EVER turn my back on people who need me' Water Tribe tm would be the first to stay and try to help. Girl infiltrated a prison and refused to escape when she had the chance just to give some earthbenders hope. It was one of her most endearing\/overbearing\/annoying at times qualities, and it just floored me seeing her so indifferent towards others. I know I'm still halfway through the season, but the fact that they had this moment with Katara of all people shows me the writers did not understand this character in the least. There's more to Katara than waterbending or her past with her mother. Though I will say those flashback's to Kya's death were horrific and I applaud this part of the series.Another thing I'll say bout Katara, is that she feels a lot less passionate throughout these episodes. Katara is pretty explossive actually, with the Waterbending scroll when she could not get the water Whip but Aang could, with Jet once she found out he was going to kill innocents... this Katara is pretty chill about Jet actually. She freezes him, says bye to him, but when she and Sokka end up in the scret tunnels, she actually defends him? It's just so weird to me because Katara is the sort of person to give you one chance, and if you betray her... well you're done my dude. The next time Katara saw Jet she went tsunami on him in Ba Sing Se, but sure have her defend the guy here. Just another example how the writers didn't understand how layered Katara truly is. Betrayal is a big thing for her.If we move onto Sokka... I didn't have much of a problem with him. Out of the main trio he is the one that retains his essence the most. Yes, his sexism is gone, but hoenstly this is one of the changes that I could accept with how they adjusted the script. Though I think Sokka being a sexist at the start of the series is better than without, I have to say this change did not ruin the character for me. He is a lot less sarcastic though, at the start he even feels more Katara-ish because of the way he is written, as in taking his role as the leader of his village and even has a more parent esque air about him than Katara does. The actor for Sokka is pretty great and makes this work without it feeling out of place even for Sokka.One character I could not for the life of me swallow in this adaptation though, was one completley butchered to the point of him being unrecognizable and to me quite unlikeable. This character is Bumi. If you are a Bumi fan, just be prepared to let go of your expectations because this character is not our crazy beloved king. Instead he is a crazy, psycho, resentful, feast-throwing king who then claims that he has to choose between giving food to orphans or the military? I could have bought a more complex Bumi arc but believe me this line would have had more weight if Bumi hadn't thrown a feast just a few scenes ago. This makes him seem like a rather incompetent, ignorant, selfish ruler that I could simply not stand. His tests rather being a playful way to make Aang think outside of the box and prepare him for the future, and guess his identity are now a way of letting out some steam at a friend who disappeared and left him alone for a hundred years, so it feels like Bumi is taking out his anger on Aang for the last 100 years. This is something that completely ruins his character as we already have a character that fulfills this purpose and that is the fisherman during the storm episode.On the Fire Nation side of things. Uncle Iroh is another feels like someone from another season case, just like Aang. The thing about season 1 Iroh, is that he was omnious character, he was a force of good on the side of the bad guys, and you never knew if he was completely good or not. You always had this sense of mystery from him, like he's such a cute old grandpa esque person but yes he's on the side of the genocidal maniacs trying to take over the world what is going to happen with this guy? This uncle Iroh feels like an end of season 2 Iroh. He is clearly not on the Fire Nation side, he is on Zuko's side. This is not a completley bad change... but it's just a less interesting change. Having Iroh being like this in season 1 leads to a more monotonous season 2 regarding his character development. That being said the actor is great and his chemistry with Zuko is fantastic. I absolutely love their moments together.Let's move onto Zuko. Overall the actor's portrayal of him is the star of the show. He has these micro expressions that nail the essence of Zuko. But then we move onto the main issue with him... it's the writing for him. It's just at the very start, but granted, the dialogue and writing for this Zuko feels a lot less empathic than the cartoon counterpart. And yes, this Zuko is more mellow, less anger issues, and yet he's managed to be portrayed in a more negative light. Let me explain, Zuko is one hard character to write. He has a balance of being a bad guy without being a bad guy in season 1. If things got on fire around Zuko, like the South Pole village, like Kyoshi Island... it was never maliciously caused, it was always a casualty of Zuko's quest for finding the Avatar... this Zuko actually threatens to burn Sokka's and Katara's village to the ground. This Zuko was about to burn Katara who was on the ground in the Kyoshi episode. Granted this Fire Nation feels a lot more menancing that with them burning people alive and all, and maybe this Zuko has seen some things, other than getting burnt by own father in a duel... but Zuko is a character that can't feel completley evil because he is going to become a good person in the end. Unless this series goes in a completely different direction, this writting of Zuko's character needs to be toned back. Also, Zuko's motivation is not his throne, it's his \"honor\". The fact that they changed such a key element to the character is just criminal. I know that one might be like a stupid thing to complain about, but this makes Zuko feel like he wants power instead of just the honor excuse, when in reality its his father's love that he wants.Speaking of father's love. Ozai... actually giving Zuko credit? Um... no. I know we don't know much about Ozai as a person even in the cartoon but one thing is certain, Ozai despises Zuko. He despised Zuko when he was a kid for being the lesser bender, when he got banished for showing disrespect, and he only started showing Zuko some \"positive\" words after he alledgedly killed Aang. Even then, Ozai always played games and manipulated Zuko. \"Prince Zuko, you've been amongst the Earth Kindom commoners...\" akka Zuko let me publicly remind you how I banished you and made you live among those people surely you understand them.And him not favoring Azula is ludricous.","rating":"6\/10","date":"23 February 2024"}

And it makes perfect sense, why they did. They merged some storylines, brought characters together that weren't normally together all to make sure we got everything we needed from a season one. Heck, they even threw in some pretty cool back story.Why do this? Because it's a different medium than animation. It's a live action. And that's something the low rating reviewers don't understand, or simply choose to ignore.Netflix brought you a live action Avatar The Last Airbender show and were able to give fans a glimpse at all the things we originally fell in love with the original. It has its flaws, yes. But nothing is perfect. The fact that they did so much with an 8 episode long season one live action series, not a 24 episode long season one animation series, is pretty impressive.Was the humor there? At times, yes. Could have personally gone for a little more. But whatever.Was it as light hearted as the original show? Nope. Why? Because it's 8 episodes not 24. And you can't fit that same amount of lightheartedness in 8 episodes no matter how hard you try. But they show will still kick you in the feels during episode 4.Was the action there? Yes. And it was rad.Is it a good show? Yes.The low ratings are all from the weebs who are complaining again because it wasn't the exact same thing that the original show was.

I also found I missed quite a lot of episodes back then. I really loved watching it. After that there are some striking similarities but also a lot of differences I really don't understand. The face of the firelord is never shown in season 1 in the animated series which makes him more evil, in the real series the firelord is not evil enough.

Some of the green screen and wigs were awful, but easy to look past. What hurts this show the most is that the shrunk everything from the first season into just 8 episodes. So freaking tired of shows getting such short seasons. It doesn't allow for any development! I really hope that streaming networks wake up and start realizing that audiences want longer seasons.","rating":"7\/10","date":"24 February 2024"}

{"title":"The seriousness of the characters is there, but...","review":"... the joy isn't.Some episodes feel rushed because the tried to cram more content into a single episode. Totally understandable, and I can completely understand that choice from the creators and writers.The characters suffered from this. They weren't allowed to build the friendship\/annoyance\/love they should feel for each other.What I really miss is the sillyness in Sokka, the annoyance in Katara, and the joy in Aang and Haru. The seriousness is there, the rest is lacking.Also, I never got goosebumps in the last episode. The original always delivers in that episode, and even the movie (as horrible as it was) managed that.","rating":"6\/10","date":"26 February 2024"}
{"title":"I love this so much","review":"This has been exceeding my expectations they built a world that is truly like the cartoon. The characters are all as if they plucked them out of the original. Daniel Dae Kim is perfection. Gordon has the innocence just like Aang. I truly cannot say how amazing this is. Azula is freaking so good at being insane. I don't want to give anything away but I will be watching this on repeat. I knew this was going to be good after how good one piece was. I should be asleep but here I am just raving about this series. Leaps and bounds more amazing than the movie that shall not be named. Will update once I'm done with the series.","rating":"10\/10","date":"22 February 2024"}
{"title":"It has potential, but still needs time to cook","review":"I have loved the original animated show and was quite looking forward to this live action since the casting seemed miles better than the 2010 movie.After finishing 8 episodes i have come to a conclusion that while it is indeed better than the movie and it's a pretty decent show, it has ALOT of room for improvements.While Dallas Liu gave an outstanding performance as Prince Zuko, sadly Gordon Cormier & Kiawentiio as Aang & Katara gave the weakest performance out of the whole cast and that's probably due to their lack of experience or the lack of good directing. It's clear they needed more time and guidance on how to deliver their lines and emotions and this was where i thought the show needed improvements the most because these two characters are the heart of the series. I hope their performance will get better if this show gets a second season.The are some things that were added to the live action that i thought were great, while there were some things that i thought didn't needed the budget and screentime that could have gone to other more important things. In my opinion the director should choose wisely on where the budget needs to go and what deserves more screentime.The fight choreographies and editing could use some improvements as well. There are times the fight scenes feel slow or not as intense due to the editing. Visual effects were pretty great.Overall, i did quite enjoy this season despite its shortcomings. The potential is there and i hope they will get better in future seasons to come.","rating":"6\/10","date":"28 February 2024"}
{"title":"I Think Bad Reviewers are Watching and Reviewing the Movie Instead of the New Series","review":"I only watched 3 episodes so far so I will update at the end. I got the humor right away in this series just like the cartoon and the script seems to be mostly and intentionally following the cartoon as I remember it so far. The casting is great, the characters look and act just like the cartoon characters. When reviewers criticize acting remember that these are kids most of whom have not been in anything major yet. The acting will improve just like with Harry Potter actors for example over time. The acting of everyone is far superior to the movie. I am very much enjoying this series so far with my three children and would recommend to old and new fans alike.","rating":"9\/10","date":"24 February 2024"}
{"title":"The pacing, the acting and the dialogue kill it","review":"The first episode is a huge exposition dump with little to no elegance. There are several scenes where its so obvious that the characters aren't talking to other characters but to the audience. And there are several scenes were characters are telling other characters information that they already know or have no business of knowing just to inform the audience.I guess all of this could have worked if the acting was at least good but the child\/teen actors they got seem to be unable to convey emotions in most situations.Another thing that did them no favor is the cleanliness of the world and its characters that Netflix productions so often have. While this worked in One Piece (a crazy world were lots of things are \"out of place\") it does not in Avatar (an immersive world with strong realism and a limited magic system).","rating":"6\/10","date":"25 February 2024"}
{"title":"Ignore the haters on this one","review":"It's beautiful. The wardrobe, the scenery, the effects.I rewatched the original in preparation for this. There are several scenes that are shot-for-shot from the original.Overall I thought the casting was pretty good. I'm not gonna nitpick the ones I didn't care for because overall I felt the series was very much a success.A lot of people are complaining that there's \"not enough humor\" but this isn't a cartoon. The stakes feel higher and therefore you don't have as much time to make light of the situation. FYI, there is a fair amount of humor; enough imo.I'm excited to see where this journey takes us.My advice is to ignore all of the low reviews and watch it with an open mind. It's just too quality of a show to skip out on cause you read some haters opinion.This isn't your Cowboy Bebop or Ghost in the Shell live action remake.Second best cartoon to film adaptation I've seen to date. Erased being the first.Watch this!","rating":"10\/10","date":"24 February 2024"}
{"title":"Worthwhile, just a few rough edges","review":"I did enjoy the show so far, I just wish that they would fix a few things. Don't have to get gory or anything, but they're fine basically showing people being burnt to death. Then all other fights are slightly beating people up and running away. Just ruins the world\/verisimilitude for me when people just are knocked over, so they're out now.Only other thing, General Iroh is the only character that actually gets his emotions in properly. All of the other characters do emotions WAY overacted. Show it better and more subtly. The sadder scenes seem a bit forced, especially when the tear\/tear line from the water are just instantly gone when they turn around. The scenes when people are angry are the worst by far, why do all the frustrated characters have to just scream really loud to get across that they are angry? It's painful sometimes and brings what could be a great show down to a good show.","rating":"7\/10","date":"26 February 2024"}
{"title":"I understand why the original creators abandoned this project","review":"If we're comparing this to that horrendous movie, this is definitely a huge improvement. But unfortunately I still feel like there's a lot here that is just not good. I'm a huge fan of the original but obviously expected stuff to be different, but the changes in this show that they have made are just....bad.I'm sure a lot of people have talked about this already but taking away sokkas sexist comments takes away a big part of him turning into a better person, he's supposed to be flawed but sees the errors in his ways by getting his ass kicked by the kyoshi warriors. Since he's just not sexist here at all, the kyoshi island episode felt a bit weird. Suki immedialty throwing herself all over Sokka after seeing him shirtless once was just weird, a lot of women in this show ironically feel like they've been written by Sokka before his character development.Katara the majority of the time comes across very shy and sweet, she doesn't feel like the \"mother\" of the group at all, but then again she can't put Sokka in his place either because again, he didn't get his character development.There's a lot more stuff that just doesn't make sense to me, aang is apparently able to just fly without using his staff, so why didn't he just fly out of the base while Zuko (or the blue spirit I mean my bad) some people might say Zuko would be too heavy, but Aang actually does this in the original by using his staff and spinning it around , which honestly seems more exhausting than just flying out of there not having to use his arms. Could have just avoided this problem by just making it so Aang can't just fly.Aang also seems to weirdly lose this flying ability after being shot down by Zuko in the first episode which was weird.Another change I did not like was the Agni Kai between Ozai and Zuko, Zuko actually has a moment in the fight where he's able to strike down at Ozai but doesn't. This destroys the whole power dynamic of Ozai. Ozai is supposed to be super strong and feared, Aang loses sleep about having to fight him and his whole journey is about stopping the firelord by mastering all four elements, you're telling me kid Zuko could have already bested Ozai?We also don't get the satisfaction of seeing Zhao realizing his plan has failed, Iroh just blasts him before the moon spirit gets restored.A lot of the moments where characters are supposed to get their development are either rushed or non existent here. Zuko just talking with Aang after being shot down by the archer is stupid, Zuko is not supposed to be ready yet to just talk to Aang like that. In the original he firebends at Aang after he listened to what he had to say, but you can still clearly see that his words reached something inside of Zuko. Here he's just having a full blown conversation with him already.Like I said I expected changes to be made, but changing and taking away a lot of the stuff that made the characters interesting in the first place was a bad call, after finishing this season I didn't feel anything for the characters, none of the emotional moments hit me in the feels because I simply didn't care about these characters. Their character development is on par with the actors in \"the play\" episode.Not to say that I hated Zuko his performance, I actually thought he was one of the strongest parts of this show, he was enjoyable to watch and brings over the Zuko energy quite well, but of course he can only do so much with the script he's been given. Some of the casting however are just plain bad. Azulas team is some of the worst casting I've seen in shows, ever.The Omashu parts I actually enjoyed watching, it wasn't perfect but I did actually enjoy them quite a bit. I wish the rest of the show was more like that.Overall though I'm still very disappointed, and I hope that somehow season 2 is going to be a huge step up from this.","rating":"5\/10","date":"27 February 2024"}
{"title":"Not really big, but worth a watch","review":"Stuns visually with epic landscapes & well-done bending effects. Score soars, but some miss the original's playful charm. But some critics have noted a lack of the original series' playful charm in the music. Sound design fares better, with immersive effects that pull you into the world. Pacing feels rushed, and some acting is uneven (check other reviews!). Still, a promising start for this new adaptation.If you're a die-hard Avatar fan, this might not be the definitive reimagining you were hoping for. However, for those looking for a visually stunning adventure with a familiar story, it's a solid offering.

Katara got better towards the end of the show but I didn't feel the connection between her and aang. I loved that they added the cabbage man. I think it could only get better from here as the actors become more in sync. I will be watching the next season. Should be 10 episodes though! Fit a bit more stuff. I'm excited to see Toph.

{"title":"Navigating the Tightrope Between Familiarity and Innovation","review":"Netflix's rendition of \"Avatar: The Last Airbender\" is a mixed bag of delights and disappointments. The episodic structure often feels disjointed, with pivotal scenes occasionally misplaced, diluting their impact. Despite promises of extended episodes for deeper exploration, the narrative struggles to find cohesion, appearing to stitch together selected chapters without a unifying thread.While the refreshed cast introduces fresh faces, many fans may still hold the animated version in higher regard. Jet's portrayal stands out as one capturing the essence of manipulation effectively, albeit among few. Actors skilled in martial arts add authenticity to action sequences, yet disparities among the cast are noticeable. Though the Fire Nation ensemble impresses overall, Azula's lack of her signature blue fire undermines her perfectionist persona. Additionally, Azula's character feels less steadfast compared to her animated counterpart, displaying vulnerability to manipulation by her father, a deviation from her usual demeanor. The animated version wouldn't have made her susceptibility to manipulation so apparent if she was.The removal of Sokka's sexist character progression seems to detract from the Kyoshi Warriors' storyline. In addition to leaving Pakku and the Northern Tribe in a odd situation given their inherently sexist society despite the younger generation's progressive views.In my view, Bumi's character arc suffers a significant blow, losing the essence of his charm from the original story where an old man teaches a child to maintain their youthful spirit. In this adaptation, Aang ends up teaching Bumi the lesson that with outside help (friends in Aang\u00ac\u00a5s case), one can achieve seemingly impossible feats, only to have this undermined when Bumi, despite seeking help, loses the battle with Azula and her army, leading to the conquest of Ba Sing Se.The inclusion of Battalion 41's storyline enriches the world-building, yet it leaves a lingering unease about Zuko's eventual abandonment of them.The decision to reverse Iroh and June's dynamics raises questions. Perhaps a more nuanced approach would have been preferable, avoiding a reversal that still perpetuates an inappropriate behavior and created a double standard. Changing the dynamic and stating that it is because the previous interpretation was wrong risks normalizing behavior that shouldn't be acceptable in either direction.While the focus on different past avatars, one from each element, is intriguing, the one-by-one approach may give the impression that there was only one previous Avatar for each element instead of several cycles involving various element changes. Additionally, the reduced focus on Roku, a deeply developed character in the animated version, is disappointing.A disappointing departure from the source material's aesthetic, the adaptation leans too heavily into a \"Gritty & Moody\" vibe reminiscent of CW dramas. However, standout elements such as fantastic special effects and generally impressive costume design redeem it within this aesthetic. Despite its moments, Netflix's \"Avatar\" adaptation struggles to strike a balance between paying homage to the original and introducing innovation.","rating":"6\/10","date":"3 March 2024"}
{"title":"Exceeded expectations","review":"I've been anxiously waiting for this series. And boy was I surprised. The effects are superb and the child actors are really good. The story is easy to follow, and for those that haven't watched the cartoon for whatever reason, they're in for a treat. This series meets all the challenges for an audience that may not know anything about this story. The series is dramatic, humorous, thrilling and just plain ole fun to watch. I took all day binge watching this series from start to finish and I was fully immersed and gratefully satisfied with what I experienced. I hope there will be more in the future. Frankly no show, series or movie can realistically satisfy everyone. But I for one throughly enjoyed myself watching this show.

{"title":"Fan of the original. Loved it!","review":"I watched the entire original series twice. I thought this was an amazing version of the story. Maybe some details are different but for me, all the beats are there. Every actor was perfectly cast. Aang was great! Just enough of a kid. Perfect disarming smile. Sokka was a perfect as a movie version of Sokka. Not as silly as the cartoon but perfect for a live version. Katara was perfect. Prince Zuko was perfect. Uncle Iroh was perfect. Fire Lord Ozai was perfect. They did a great job with Bumi.There was enough goofballness but not too much because it wouldn't have worked outside a cartoon. For me, in total, it surpassed the original! Watching the original it was clearly targeted at children. This one managed to be updated at least a little for a slight older audience.The effects were pretty great too. I was worried in the first episode where they show the end of the Airbenders since it was hard to follow the moves but it picked up and was looking great by the end. They did an amazing job showing Earbending and Waterbending and all the creative ways to attack. I'm super looking forward to season 2.I certainly would have loved it if they'd made it longer. More June for example since she was like on the screen for 2 minutes total or so it felt with no explanation of her talents. But, given they apparently had to squeeze it into 8 episodes for some reason I think they did an amazing job.","rating":"8\/10","date":"26 February 2024"}
{"title":"a fair adaptation","review":"I have been waiting for this for this adaption since the first rumours started popping up. I am a huge fan of the original animation but I will try to keep that out of this review until I get to the comparison part.We follow the avatar and his friends while he is trying to find out what his role and responsibilities are in the world that he has just woken up in, while they are being pursued by many enemies.The world that is being displayed looks really beautiful and detailed and the bending effects are amazing.I found most characters likeable and for most part the story still had me engaged the whole time. We get some amazing performances by some of the cast and I feel in general that all of the actors did a fine job.I did feel however, especially in the earlier episodes that things are being spelled out a little bit too much for me. The exposition was a bit too much for me and the way it sometimes came over didn't feel natural at all. When they did the exposition as in episode 6 I felt much more engaged.In comparison to the animation, this show presents things more linearly right from the start which I feel might hurt the show. The mystery in the animation played a big part in the best moments in the show.The adaptation of many of the arcs felt quite well done and to me it just made sense since we didn't have 20 minute episodes to do all the side quests on their own.I do feel that the animation is the better product, but I am glad that this exists and I going to watch all seasons that this show will hopefully get. I thing now that the world is introduced the follow up seasons will have a much better time as they would not have to try to coney all this information about the world.","rating":"6\/10","date":"24 February 2024"}
{"title":"The adaptation couldn't be worse!","review":"I am a fan and lover of the masterpiece animated series \"Avatar: The Last Airbender\", since my early childhood. Throughout my life I have re-watched it many times, and for me it is a benchmark. After the announcement of the series, I had no expectations. I realised that everything great was already in the original, and there was nothing I wanted to change. For those years, namely 2005, still on Nickelodeon, the show was just fine. But the show is there, and I decided to watch it after all. Will they be able to convey that atmosphere, those characters, the all-time favourite adventure of the Avatar team? Not to surpass, but at least try to create something acceptable to watch. There is no limit to my disappointment, as it was boring and impossible to watch.PlotThe main problem lies in the characters themselves and the illogical narrative. The differently important storylines are stitched together, resulting in a mush of jumbled characters and events. A huge number of really important moments have been cut, omitted or reworked.CharactersThe acting is worse than ever, characters exchange empty lines, there is no chemistry between the main characters. The main features and chips of the characters are missed.Katara - the main mother, who always supported and was a pillar of the team, here generally performs the role of furniture. Where is that fiery, determined Katara, who with persistence tried to master water magic and took risks to get a scroll of water magic?Sokka - the main jokester, turned into a humourless jester, where all the girls in the neighbourhood come to him for nothing, although in the original he was bribing with his humour, charisma and ability to admit his mistakes.Aang - although being the Avatar with great responsibility to the world, he remained cheerful and was always optimistic, here he is a sullen boy who constantly walks with a sad face.It's understandable that they wanted to try to make it more serious, but why would the characters change their main character traits? Why turn perfectly written characters into this?Everyone has been turned into fools who sue the little boy for abandoning them all. Almost all of the past avatars are hysterical - without a fraction of wisdom or understanding. The only moment that can be singled out for joy and warmth is the bond between Zuko and Iroh. Their relationship is really shown well, as well as the actors themselves are well chosen. That's where all the good stuff endsConclusionIn the end we have - in some places delightful shots, a few charming characters and that's it. I categorically do not recommend watching, better start the original or rewatch it again. A pathetic parody of a theatre episode, not a TV series.2\/10.","rating":"2\/10","date":"19 April 2024"}
{"title":"The first episodes were below par but towards the end it started getting better","review":"At first they were able to wrap up alot during the first episode and i thought it would be a pretty fast one then along the line they started dragging the story unnecessarily and wasting time with unnecessary scenes.So the first few episodes i did not feel any emotion or connection with the characters cos i felt they were not acting their well or the production was somehow i wasn't sure were the issue was coming from. The words used were so cheesy and clich\u221a\u00a9, but during the later part of the episodes better thespians started making it fun like zuko's uncle, and the zuko's sister and the man that killed the fish(full moon) princess yue,bumi she was so pretty i feel that was when the movie started getting some life into it.So my take is that it seems those other thespians brought out the best in the lead actors like katara and her brother.I loved aang he was so adorable and cute but hopefully in the next series he would be more mature and in handling things cos i was getting pissed off at some point but well i guess cos he is a 12 y.old and they wanted him to act the part.I loved the graphics and the cgi it was more real than the previous avatar last airbender but i feel katara does some water tricks and she does not get wet they should improve on that you canmt water bend and not get touched by water.Anyway i enjoyed the movie more when it was approaching the end but it took too much time for the characters to develop.

{"title":"My first IMDB review ever","review":"[[I've only watched ep 1 so far, as I'm watching it with my lady and we dont have a ton of time together so take my review with a grain of salt until I can come back and give it a full analysis]]I cannot express how excited I was for this. Even more so after finding out how passionate the cast is about the series.However, just in the first ep, I can't help but feel a bit let down. The moments I think back on and thoroughly enjoy are a shell of what they are in the show.1: Appa flying to the surprise of Saka2: The reveal that Aang is the Avatar (after being rejected by the Water Tribe and sent away, thinking it was just some annoying kid that signaled the Fire Nation)3: The epic fight on the boat, the very first time Aang goes into the Avatar state after coming out of the ice. Which afterwards, Katara uses her powers wrong then does so again tho to her advantage.I do like some of the changes so far and the casting is solid. I just really wish some of these things stayed in this adaptation and they didn't get too far ahead of themselves. I heard Iroh is perfectly portrayed, that makes me soo happy to hear. However, I already see alot of Telling instead of Showing, alot of scrapped epic moments, etc, and that makes me nervous.","rating":"7\/10","date":"26 February 2024"}

In its core it stays true to the spirit of avatar, as a fan I didn't mind that it isnt 1:1 adaption, all i wanted was that the very core of this feels like avatar. And the team made it possible.

{"title":"All you need to know before watching the Live Action of Avatar the Last Airbender!","review":"As you're debating if you should check out the Live Action of Avatar the Last Airbender you see reviews giving it 8-9 stars and others 5-6 stars which confuses you. The truth lies in the middle, this series is a solid 7 hence the appropriate IMDB rating of 7.5! Let's just say that adapting the best animated series ever made is a hard job and everyone will have high expectations and nostalgia. Let's start with what Netflix did RIGHT. The VISUALS and SOUNDS are amazing and really well made. They brought the world of avatar to life and the scenery, costumes and special effects are of high quality. The music uses tracks of the original series making you emotional and the new sounds fit into the atmosphere. The story has a NEW PLOT which is a good thing, it's boring to have an exact copy of every event in the animated series. Why watch this then? They showed how things could have happened differently and uncovered things we didn't see in the original series like the air nation genocide, how Zuko saved the 41st division and the funeral of Iroh's son. The BENDING is really well made, has good flow and uses some martial art moves. There's a fight scene in Omashu streets that feels like a Jackie Chan movie. Lastly, the CASTING is really accurate as far as we can go in real life, every character looks like how they did in the original series except for Mai and Bumi who stand out. The actors do bring out the personality of their characters when they get the chance which brings me to the bad aspects. Netflix did get some things WRONG. The DIALOGUE is really bland and uninteresting as well as there being too much exposition. Instead of showing us how things work they are constantly reminding us of how the story goes as if we have the memory of a goldfish. The ACTING is cheesy sometimes because the scenes are not handled well and actors are young and inexperienced which is understandable. The WRITING strips away the personality and flaws of the original characters making them more bland and less evolving. However, it is rare to have new Avatar content and Netflix worked hard and spend a lot on this. It would be a shame to not bring to life the next season where Toph gets introduced now that the audience is familiar with the way the new Live Action world works. We should be more appreciative and less hypercritical, nothing can live up to the masterpiece that is the original series. Let's give Netflix another chance to improve and support this project. I highly recommend you check it out and hope you enjoy it as much as I did!","rating":"7\/10","date":"26 February 2024"}
{"title":"Great watch","review":"This live action version felt connected to the original storyline without being bogged down by some of the less serious parts or \"filler\" that you see in the animated version of book 1. The emotional awareness continues to be there. The acting felt genuine throughout and the casting of each role felt very well thought out. Truly enjoyed watching and felt the special effects improved as the episodes went on. By episode eight I was sad to have to wait for more of this story to be made as a live action version. Hoping that this enjoys success that will lead to further seasons being made in a timely matter.","rating":"9\/10","date":"25 February 2024"}
{"title":"Not bad, but not great.","review":"All I'll just say for now that I enjoy it. Has some great visuals, and action. Although, I can't stand some of the very abundant quicks cuts during fight sequences. It sticks fairly true to the original, but it's definitely not 1:1. Performances are mostly good, and the only one I absolutely can't stand is Zuko. His acting just doesn't hit the mark for me. His line deliveries feel very 1st year acting school, and he's definitely not angry enough for the character. Whoever chose to portray him as sad and pathetic rather than angry should be fired. For what it's worth though, I am hoping we get more. A second season could improve on a lot of the problems and elevate it from ok\/good to something great.","rating":"7\/10","date":"24 February 2024"}
{"title":"The story was okay","review":"The series seemed kinda rushed despite being announced a couple of years ago. Weak actors, but nice special effects, it seems that they cared more about making cool visuals, and not really focusing on the story itself, a huge letdown. Even the humor is weak. The movie did a better job than this series, and even the movie was a huge letdown. I watched all of the episodes at the course of an evening\/night, and I wouldnt even give it a second watch, the animated series is way more enjoyable and actually rewatchableThe cartoon does a way better job and actually uses correct timelines unlike the live action series.","rating":"3\/10","date":"21 April 2024"}
{"title":"Avatar: The Last Airbender Continues to Captivate with Timeless Themes and Rich Storytelling","review":"\"The Last Airbender\" TV series, also known as \"Avatar: The Last Airbender,\" is widely celebrated for its rich storytelling, complex characters, and deep cultural influences that span various Eastern philosophies and martial arts. The show distinguishes itself with a well-crafted world where the elements themselves-water, earth, fire, and air-are intricately woven into the culture, politics, and warfare of its universe. Its ability to handle mature themes such as war, spirituality, and identity within a format accessible to younger audiences is particularly commendable. The character development is remarkable, with each member of the cast experiencing significant growth and challenges that resonate with viewers of all ages. Nostalgically, it remains a touchstone for many, reminding them of the lessons on bravery, loyalty, and the importance of balance. The series continues to be relevant and engaging, testament to its enduring appeal and impact on its generation.","rating":"7\/10","date":"4 May 2024"}
{"title":"Yep Yep Netflix","review":"The 2024 nik\/Netflix live action series that I started to return to as soon as it ended.Due to the channel on which the animation is broadcast, places that should be dark but are not are handled perfectly in this series.For example, firebenders are burning people to death.It is also explained very well how important element bending is and how it works on the characters of the benders.Sound design '(dolby atmos' 5.1.2), set design, acting, music... Netflix has once again managed to handle a live action series very well.This work, just like its animation, will be a cultural heritage passed on from generation to generation. It was made with a quality that befits it because everyone who worked on this work was aware of what an important job they were doing.","rating":"10\/10","date":"24 February 2024"}
{"title":"Something is missing","review":"The background is just as unique as the cartoons. The costumes the same. Have to say that the casting is right (especially when you compare it to the movie) but I feel like there is something missing. I feel like it's because of the acting I just don't feel the energy or the emotion that the actors are trying to give. I sometimes feel like, they're trying to copy the cartoons, and not making their own version. It's all right as it is all based in the cartoons, but from what I remember, there seems to be some differences and also, this is a live action version. That is why making their own interpretation of the characters would have helped , even though, yeah, they have the same hairstyle, costumes, and almost everything . Another thing, is that I hoped for the next season if ever, there will be one, is that all the important actors would have known how to move like martial arts masters.I've waited long for this series, but the cartoons still is top tier for me. Never mind the movie, that was just a mess. If they have a season two, I will watch it also. But I do hope that it's better than this season.(And if ever another showrunner wants to do another series just like this one I do hope that it's better than this.)Rating is 6.5, I just don't like it that they gave us the princess already. That's why I gave it the six.","rating":"6\/10","date":"25 February 2024"}
{"title":"Great and true to form","review":"This is how it's done. Even the cadence of speech is similiar to the voice actors of the animated series. This is how it is supposed to be done, don't add but just stick to the original.Ok so I'm just one episode deep into the series but I can already tell how much they've triee with this and it will be rewarded. Upgraded my account to 4K just to watch this in all its glory.Some scenes are really shot by shot and frame by frame from the animated series AND THIS IS HOW YOU DO IT. Don't mess with perfection.Great actors, great direction, great FX snd TRUE to source. Keep doing what you're doing Netflix, give fans what they want as opposed to BS like The Witcher.","rating":"8\/10","date":"24 February 2024"}
{"title":"Enthralling and evoking nostalgia, slightly trailing the original series.","review":"The live-action rendition presents a mixed bag of experiences, blending moments of delight with occasional disappointments for the original series aficionados. Its narrative endeavors capture elements that resonate with fans, while also deviating in ways that may not entirely please purists. Nevertheless, it offers a commendable attempt at translating a cherished series into live-action form.Within this adaptation, there exist segments that stand out, showcasing a genuine affection for the source material. These instances evoke nostalgia and stir emotions, fostering a sense of connection with the beloved characters and their journeys. They serve as poignant reminders of what made the original series so beloved, injecting moments of joy and excitement into the viewing experience.Yet, amidst these moments of brilliance, there are also aspects that fall short of expectations. Certain deviations from the source material may alienate die-hard fans, leading to feelings of frustration or dissatisfaction. These departures, whether in plot progression or character interpretation, can create a sense of disconnect, undermining the immersive quality of the adaptation.Despite these shortcomings, the live-action adaptation manages to carve out its own identity, offering a fresh perspective on familiar narratives. It presents an opportunity to revisit beloved characters and explore their stories through a new lens. While it may not replicate the magic of the original series, it offers a chance for fans to rediscover their favorite series in a different format.Comparisons to the original cartoon are inevitable, and indeed, the live-action adaptation occupies a distinct space within the broader realm of storytelling. It cannot hope to replicate the charm and nostalgia associated with its animated counterpart, which holds a revered status in the hearts of fans. However, it does provide a platform for reimagining beloved characters and narratives in a tangible, real-world setting.Ultimately, the appeal of the live-action adaptation lies in its ability to evoke a sense of familiarity while also introducing elements of novelty. It allows fans to reconnect with cherished characters and immerse themselves in familiar yet reinterpreted storylines. While it may not surpass the original cartoon, it offers a worthwhile experience for those seeking to revisit their favorite anime series through a new medium.In conclusion, while the live-action adaptation of the beloved anime series has its flaws, it also has moments of genuine charm and excitement. It serves as a commendable effort to bring beloved characters to life in a new format, offering fans an opportunity to reconnect with familiar narratives in a fresh and engaging way.","rating":"7\/10","date":"2 March 2024"}
{"title":"I absolutely loved it!","review":"So to start i wanna say where im at\nI watch the cartoon as it came out as a kid and many times since, I love Aang and Korra, so I really hope they continue this series and do one for korra aswell. I have not read any comics but that's about to change. So yes I am quite a big fan.I quite literally finished this and I gotta say it has its ups and downs but over all. I absolutely loved it, I loved Aang, Katara, Sokka, Zuko... Hell. I loved them all!! My only casting nit picks is\nTy lee - should of had brown hair, (makes her stand out more from the other 2)\nAzula - She looks good, but in my opinion looks to cute to look psycho but who knows,\nMai - I will admit Mai is one I'm not the biggest fan of. And it sucks to say BUT\nBumi - I really didn't like him.. he felt more like just an ass rather then an old friend playing tricks. Hope they fix thatEveyone else lookwise was great!The combination of episodes did throw me off alittle bit, and unfortunately felt like it took away the story from both. E.g Aang Spirit trip with the guardian of the Forrest and Koh. Also joining S1E5 (King of Omashu) and S2E2 (Cave of 2 lovers)that threw me off alot but it kinda worked. P.s i love they kept the singer travellers!!) , Also much as I love the \"filler\" type episodes, ( Great Devide, Fortuneteller) I understand why alot was cut, BUT even if it's the 1st episode of season 2 they need to adapt S1E16. Aang needs to try firebending before Zuko teaches him and he need to accidentally burn Katara and swear not to do it again etc. But the last few episodes were amazing! I really need season 2 and 3, mainly cause we have never seen a live action toph! And her eyes better be right. But back to the show again honestly I really enjoyed it, they did a good job, so much better then the movie, (low bar I know) but they did great!But make sure they know what key moments to have in season 2, bring the owl back for the library! Toph In Aangs vision from the swap and in the tournament! But fingers crossed for Season 2 and 3.","rating":"9\/10","date":"28 February 2024"}
{"title":"The Netflix Curse","review":"The series sticks to the original story, the acting is good and the effects are engaging. Yet I would rate it a 6 because it suffers from the Netflix Curse.Whats the Netflix Curse, you ask?The Curse is Netflix's strategy to unnecessarily long wind and strech a series by inserting irrelevant conversations and backdrop stories, to increase runtime and consumption.Thanks to the Curse, a bunch of otherwise engaging stories remain abandoned half-watched in my profile. I tried really hard, but I just could not get myself to complete them. Sweet Tooth 2, One piece, Manifest, Designated Survivor,Orange is the New Black, The Protector, The Witcher, Shadow and Bone and so on.Earlier, the Curse would be inflicted only on multiple season series. Now it affects limited series too.I did watch the Last Airbender series to completion. However it was playing in the background while I was doing other chores. Because there is no much of irrelevant conversations, extended scenes, meaningless backstories that you can miss swathes of the show without really missing the story.The Curse is the reason why I have stopped coming to Netflix much, unless I know they are releasing something I know(like the Airbender). Even then, I expect it to be afflicted by the Curse.Whoever has designed this strategy in Netflix, really needs to understand that although this might be getting them more hours consumed in the short term, if not corrected The Netflix Curse is going to be their doom.","rating":"6\/10","date":"10 March 2024"}
{"title":"Really ? That bad ?","review":"I should make it clear that i'm not bashing any of the fans of the OG series nor am i demeaning their sentiments regarding this show. As a long time fan of the franchise(including Korra), and having watched the show as many times that i've lost count, i was happy with this adaptation. I could even say that i was overwhelmed at some parts. THIS GAVE ME THE FEELING OF AVATAR:THE LAST AIRBENDER. Adapting something has never been easy nor has it been flawless. But what's destructive is the expectations of \"fans\". Sure there are a lot of adaptations that are just horrible in every aspect but this sure isn't one.I felt Avatar being done justice in every way possible. Yes, some parts could have been better but they do not do take anything away either from the story or the watching experience. Great CGI and vfx, good acting from the characters and a coherent retelling of the story. Nothing felt out of place. Expositions are present in the OG series too but there is only so much you can show in live action, that too while adapting a series.The same fans who are bashing it are the ones who were salivating at the trailers. Guess people would choose to be hypocritical just to jump on the bandwagon of whatever's relevant.If this series doesn't get a season 2 greenlight based on the \"fans\" reviews, it'll just be their loss.","rating":"9\/10","date":"24 February 2024"}
{"title":"So much potential, wasted in the rush of 8 episode format.","review":"I'm so conflicted about this, I'm a huge fan of the original show, and did generally find myself enjoying this remake. However the more I watched the more I realized that the live-action remake was missing what made the original so great: the character stories and connection. The remake is beautiful, and I think it was well cast (though I did find myself distracted by the fact that the actor who plays Aang felt like the weak link as far as acting capability, but he is just a kid still!). More than anything I wish they had showed the development of Katara and Aang's connection because so much of the plot hinges on it.Had they maybe done even a 12 episode arc instead of 8 they could have taken the time to properly explore and grow the characters and their connection, but because they didn't the show felt more hollow and lacking the heart and depth that it truly deserves.","rating":"7\/10","date":"1 March 2024"}
{"title":"About the same disrespect as M. Night Shyamalan did","review":"My original rating would been higher solely because of the incredible action scenes, fight choreographs and jaw-dropping visuals, because that's what an adaptation should be; improving upon things which was not possible at that time. Unfortunately, that's where all the positives end, the reason why I'm giving such a low rating to one of my favorite series since childhood is because of the absolute disrespect to the original source. It seems somewhere along the line, the great writers of Netflix have forgotten about the saying \"If it's not broken, don't fix it\" along with plenty of other sayings like, the most important being \"SHOW, NOT TELL\". As you watch the show, you can understand why the ORIGINAL WRITERS OF THE SERIES have LEFT the production. This is going to be a long one so play Subway Surfer on your side to soothe your low attention span as you read.Let's start with the disrespect, they completely altered Aang (the series protagonist) the once playful, talented Air bender with a brave heart and a soul that knows what is right into an EDGE LORD, who now constantly goes into monologues about his feelings in the span of 15 minutes and seeks for VENGEANCE. The once playful Aang now never jokes around, makes creative use of bending, or even playfully bests his opponents anymore.Then we have Katara whose character arc has taken a complete detour from her original, she no longer plays Aang's love interest due to the actor's age difference (we will come back to the casting) Her arc is just the live-action Mulan, she is now already a master water-bender being held back by the damn sOcIEtY from reaching her greatness that she is rightfully entitled to. It almost seems that our \"modern\" writers at Netflix can't come to terms that we as an audience don't want our characters to win, we want them to GROW. We won't get to see Katara spend her time learning and sharing her journey alongside Aang in mastering water-bending and becoming one of the strongest water benders (because she already is). Speaking of sharing her journey with Aang, their chemistry is almost nonexistent. And this has nothing to do with their adapted relationship, they just don't seem like they get along. Every scene they share is just awkward and shallow.Now we get to Sokka, while he is still a knucklehead. Every other aspect of him has been eradicated, he no longer makes sarcastic remarks or any of the terrible dad jokes. He is now a straight-up jerk, who was willing to sacrifice Aang in the first episode. Sokka, just like his sister has already become a great leader, harnessing great leadership qualities at the start and being able to command boys his age without being laughed at or taken un-seriously. One of his main character arcs has been entirely shot out the window because the writers thought sexism was way too vile in a series where they showed a genocide and people getting BURNED to their death in the first episode. We no longer get to see Sokka learning to accept that women are as capable (or even BETTER) fighters than he is while still being feminine, and deserving of love and respect. And his relationship with Suki starts off sexual instead of mutual respect. It's as if Suki has been seen a male in her life. Huge props to Netflix for never failing to deliver the right message!Now let's talk about the casting because of the huge fuss there was around it, and rightfully so. There is absolutely no way they couldn't anyone else to play Aang and Katara to the point they had to drastically change one of the character growth arcs. It's not bad but it isn't close to Oscar-worthy either. I can't really tell if the script is the issue or if they can't act. As for some of the side characters, When I say the acting was bad, it's atrocious. It's almost like the casting just went for stunt actors and not trained\/experienced actors.I was really disappointed in Paul Sun-hyung portrayal of General Iroh (a fan favorite including mine). Despite having experience in comedy, his performance was weak and his delivery always fell flat (like most of the cast). The once wise old man with a cunning mischievous spirit is now a whitewashed Asian American with the heaviest American accent and his running gag just spitting his jasmine tea obsession to your face every 5 minutes. He somehow openly has the same energy as his nephew and he does not have the iconic style of talking that both of the original voice actors (May his soul rest in peace) were able to capture.And finally, the writing, which I'm absolutely firm about being 99% of the issues. The writing is HIDIOUS. It genuinely hurt my spine when I heard the village elder narrate the cartoon series' intro middle of a conversation with no flow whatsoever. Of everything the writers shamelessly decided to change, ironically this dialogue was not even \"ADAPTED\" one bit to help the flow of the conversation. It was ripped word to word and copy-pasted into the scene. Unfortunately for many of the poor souls that went through this faithful adaptation including mine, there are many more instances with atrocious writing like this. I can't understand what kind of entitlement the writers had that the original writers just kicked themselves out of the production. And I haven't mentioned the amount of mind-numbing exposition being thrown at us. They keep telling us about EVERYTHING rather than have us find out gradually which just takes away the mystery and intrigue the audience would feel about the world of Avatar. They skipped over how the monks knew Aang was the avatar, they skipped over Aang meeting his predecessors and letting him find out about the upcoming war, and instead have it fed down by POINTLESS EXPOSITION. The fact that writers also completely skipped over so many iconic scenes in the animated series which could've shined much more with the modern technology. The jokes are flat, The chemistry is nonexistent, and the characters are butchered for the \"modern audience\" to swallow as if the original versions of them would have sent us into a coma. And the amount of unnecessary changes is absurd! I totally understand that the adaption can't be 1:1 of the original, but it doesn't mean you massacre what made the show so good at first and completely change\/remove aspects of the show and characters. These writers are just committing the same sins as Shyamalan did.In conclusion, this show isn't for the old fans at all and truly not worth their time. If you're here for the great fight scenes, you can just wait for them to be uploaded to YouTube and save yourself the subscription. And even if you are a new fan, I still see no reason why you would pick to watch this over the original. I am really doing my best to not be as negative as it is my favorite childhood show. But I'm not someone who would see flashy CGI and let my primal instincts kick in. I firmly believe when a show is bad and a bad adaptation in this case, it should be criticized.","rating":"1\/10","date":"23 February 2024"}

Adapting from animation to live action is so difficult but in this case I would say they did a great job. The accuracy was amazing. I'm thankful to the producers for giving us this amazing adaptation. The live action version of Avatar: The Last Airbender has all the action, heart, humor, and drama of the original, but woth excellent casting and effects.

{"title":"5 and a bonus star for Waterzilla Aang","review":"Overall: 6\/10\nVisuals\/CGI: 4\/5\nCostumes: 4\/5\nActing: 2\/5\nDialog: 2\/5\nBending: 5\/5 for fire but 3\/5 for the other three\nStoryline: 4\/5\nMusic: 10\/10Okay that's just a summation of how I feel but here's the details:The visuals were stunning. However, with an obvious amount of CGI used, at times the green screen environment didn't match the lighting on the characters which made it feel more like a theatre performance.As did the acting, which was...well, kind of awful. I'm assuming this is the kids' first acting job, so it's understandable that it'd be a little off, but I feel like they sacrificed quality acting for on-point lookalikes of the cartoon characters.Unfortunately, because they couldn't match 1:1 every episode of the cartoon, they had to mash a bunch of episodes together. I feel at most times they did this in a tasteful manner, but there were some changes that I didn't appreciate.Honorable mention to the music. I was curious to see if they'd keep it the same, they did, and ramped it up a knotch and that pleased me very much because I'm all about mood music!Costume department: 10\/10 for accuracy but why is EVERYTHING so fake and bulky? I feel like Katara's costume was part of her downfall in this show. The acting wasn't great to begin with and now her body language is super poor because she can barely move her body in this straight jacket of a costume she has to wear. Cartoon Katara's clothes complimented her bending movements and FLOWED LIKE WATER with her.Let's talk about the bending. The fire bending was outstanding. The rest: why is it all in slow motion?? I don't get it. I appreciate that it was done accurately though compared to the awful movie we shall not speak of.Things I hated:\n1) Yue - the only character that looked absolutely nothing like the cartoon. Wrong color hair, wrong color skin, wrong color eyes, and wtf was with that wig?? Zero effort in making that look realistic. And how did she know Sokka was her \"dream guy\" when she literally just met him?2) Han - him being a jerk in the tv cartoon was good for tv, they should have kept it\n3) Pakku - why did we not connect him with Khana??? Also good for tv and a very valuable part of the cartoon4) Zhaou - why are we giving this short king so much screen time? He had a handful of scenes in the cartoon and one of which wasn't even in this version.5) ZERO chemistry between our main 3 characters. Absolutely none. Made it super awkward.6) Momo didn't need to die, they could have used that screen time to make the love story between Sokka and Yue and Han make sense.7) AANG DOESNT WATER BEND. Cartoon season 1 is literally called WATER because it's the season where he LEARNS TO WATER BEND. But he literally doesn't water bend the entire season. What the F?8) Why did Aang go to Rokus island alone? Not cool.9) Why is Bummi such a jerk?10) The fact that I'm supposed to accept Katara and Aang will be together and in love somehow at some point. Like what? They don't even talk to each other much. Where's the relationship building scenes?? There are none for almost any of the important relationships in the show. They could have peppered in a few more episodes of JUST relationship building.Things I loved:1) So much more accurate and visually better than the movie we don't talk about.2) The music GAH so good.3) The comic book references (mother of faces) and also just any little tidbits of references from the cartoon.4) The way they mashed everything together in Omashu. It was tasteful and made sense.5) That they showed scenes we didn't get to see from the cartoon like Azula being emotionally abused by Ozai, Sozin killing the Airbenders, and Ozai in the library with the observatory at the end just to name a few.6) My cabbages.7) The accuracy of the characters, costumes, and environments, visually only. The actors were not the right pick for the personalities of the characters (except maybe Sokka) and the clothing was dysfunctional.8) Waterzilla Aang was pretty epic.9) Any of the fire bending fight scenes.","rating":"6\/10","date":"26 February 2024"}
{"title":"Do not have expectations and you will enjoy","review":"DO NOT SET PRECONCEIVED EXPECTATIONS for this and you will enjoy. Continuity of storyline has always been important to me when my childhood favorites are recreated as live action. If you enjoyed the original for its humor, this adaptation is a substantially darker storyline. The humor that Sokka and Iroh brought to the original was so funny, but none of that exists. When casting for a remake, in my opinion your cast needs to resemble as closely as possible to the original. Besides Aang, Bumi, Sokka, and Ozai, the casting was unsuccessful. Like where are Sokka and Kataras blue eyes? This 2024 adaptation is a much darker storyline, feels more grown-up\/ mature.My biggest issue is that storylines are overlapping each other, it feels like its been rushed. I found myself repeating, \"wait? That doesn't happen yet?\". They should have broken the show into seasons based on the element mastered, like the original. They leave out huge chunks of the storyline, while also adding in more of the character background. I love the editions but leaving out so much is annoying, they could have easily extended the season to 12 to15 episodes. The time they spent traveling and helping the villages they visit, were the best part of the story.For instance, in S1. E5 Spirited Away, they are provided guidance and wisdom by the owl from the original S2. E10. The Library. In the live action it shows that they met the owl in a forest, whereas in the original they do not meet the owl in a forest. They meet the owl Wan Shi Tong, in a lost library that houses of all the worlds knowledge, and it is in the middle of the desert, and the same episode of the original, this is where Appa is stolen. In the original, the inventor and his son entered the cast S1. E17 in the Northern Air Temple, while the live action shows them S1. E3 in the earth kingdom Omashu. There are so many other storyline errors, but if you watch is without comparing it to the animated version, you will enjoy it.","rating":"8\/10","date":"27 February 2024"}
{"title":"Not bad, but has so much unused potential","review":"After ruining The Witcher, Netflix had a chance to make something epic with this amazing Nickelodeon cartoon. But they chose the mediocre way again. Just enough budget to maintain their subscription, nothing more.None cares about the death of Gyatso, because his screen time was litterly 30 seconds. Why not give him more time? He is the mentor of the main character... When Aang fell into the sea and turned into an ice ball, that moment was so bland and boring. They could have made it so much more impacful. Make him struggle. Let the new viewers think he is drowning. Make him glow up in an epic way. But no, it litterly took 5 seconds.

And they did a great job at trying to keep the majority of source material. But every adaptation is going to loose some of the story arc.

I will admit the first episode is rough, and that may be because it's almost so close to the original that I compared it, but episodes two and onward are good! As a live-action adaptation, it does what it's supposed to do.

This series is like if you poured them all out, mixed them together, and were told you had to solve it.Not only does it looks bad, feature embarrassing CGI effects\/choreography, have terribly-written dialogue, poor acting, and worse humor than the original series, but it somehow manages to gets even the most basic characterizations wrong. Sokka and Azula both suddenly have daddy issues when they didn't before (or at least to this extent). Sokka's dad is embarrassed by him now? Why?! Isn't Hakoda supposed to be a strategist and inventor too? Not anymore, I guess! Everyone's got to have issues and positive role models don't exist! Azula's cold, calculating nature from season 2 is all but gone, replaced with someone whose already on-edge and overly-emotional. She also talks back to her father in public, which is apparently not banishment worthy in the Fire Nation unless you're Zuko.Katara is basically unrecognizable. She's upset she's seen as a \"little sister who can't take care of herself,\" which is the exact opposite of her characterization in the original series. Iroh's so blatantly a turned good guy in episode 1, he may as well be looking into the camera and spelling it out for people. He's chit-chatting with Aang and handing out sage wisdom so often, you'd think he only spoke in proverbs. I'm kidding, but I think the writers of this show might actually think that. He even tries to jump in to save Zuko during the Agni Kai with Ozai, which is also not banishment worthy, I guess. Poor Bumi was a victim of character assassination, both figuratively and literally. Ty Lee and Mai are introduced, only to have them stand in the background and do nothing. No fun in this super serious Netflix adaptation, no sir! Ozai, whose supposed to overwhelmingly favor Azula, is now trying to pit her against Zuko for some reason? And is condemning her for being coy and deceitful? You know, the guy that killed his own father to take over as Fire Lord? I wasn't totally against introducing Ozai this early on in the series, but they dropped the ball so hard, it's unreal.Storylines and episodes from different points in the series (even scenes as far out as the OG's season 3) are mixed together in a way that's confusing to both old fans & potential watchers. Some of the new additions just straight up make no sense, like Kyoshi being so prominent instead of Roku, the spirit world having Wan Shi Tong and elements of the season 2 episode \"the Swamp,\" or Omashu having Fire Nation spies. Despite being nearly the same length as the original series' first season, this live action version feels incredibly rushed and disjointed. There's no room left for ambiguity or intrigue about the world or its people for newcomers, since everything is explained through stilted, expository dialogue in the first few episodes. Gran Gran says the intro of the animated show word-for-word as dialogue in what might be the most cringe-inducing scene I've seen in quite some time. Almost every new element added or old element removed is worse than the original and doesn't make any narrative sense. Why leave Sozin's Comet out until the end and effectively delete any tension\/hook the show could've had? If time was the issue, just make it 3 years away or something instead of the end of Summer. Why isn't Aang learning any waterbending over the course of the season? Why does Aang not run away from his responsibilities (his main source of guilt)? Why even do \"the Cave of Two Lovers\" without Aang? What a waste!And more importantly, where are the moral quandaries and questions from the animated series? Why skip Jeong Jeong and Aang's hard lesson about control? Or the lesson about learning to accept change from the \"newly-renovated\" Northern Air Temple? I know it may seem silly to harp on the lack of lessons for kids in the gritty Netflix adaptation, but they are necessary for Aang as a character to experience. You can't just cut them out and replace them with nothing! And it's not just Aang; Katara's most important character moments from this season are completely cut out (\"Imprisoned,\" \"The Waterbending Scroll\"), leaving her with no growth at all. For all the \"strong female empowerment\" lip service you hear in interviews, leave it to Netflix to make one of the main heroines completely wooden and boring. How about instead of showing us every character's backstory a season too early, why not delve deeper into the characters than the OG show could through character interactions? They do this once with the Blue Spirit episode and in Suki's introduction. But aside from those scenes, that's pretty much it. Like the terrible 2010 movie, this show's so focused on giving you the CliffNotes version of A:TLA and shoving action set pieces in your face that it forgets why people actually liked the original in the first place. Netflix-budget CGI bending and scenic vistas are cool and all, but you know what's cooler? Good writing and characters!The original Avatar: The Last Airbender animated series was one that kids, teens, and adults could enjoy. It's not perfect, despite what many people claim, but it does a lot right. This live action version does almost nothing right. It's inferior in basically every conceivable way. And just like all of these cash-grab remakes, all it does is make me want to watch the original again. Rushing through the story like they did makes me wonder why they even bothered adapting it at all, aside from money. Do grown adults in 2024 really turn their nose at an almost universally-beloved show because it's animated so often that it justifies making this wannabe Game of Thrones bilge?I doubt there's anyone out there foolish enough to do this, but just in case: if you're trying to get into A:TLA through this series, you are doing yourself a huge disservice. Put your ego on the shelf and just watch the animated version.","rating":"4\/10","date":"23 February 2024"}
{"title":"First thoughts of a huge ALTA Fan","review":"So this is my first movie \/ show review. I am such a huge fan of the original show. I will now share my first thoughts after watching the live-action show. Maybe some things will change after a rewatch.The first episode shows some events 100 years ago, especially how the war started, which I liked. I felt like Aang and Gyatso's relationship was very well made. For my taste, it could have been even a little more screentime about Aang and his life before the war. As for Aang, I feel like he is cast very well. I do like his vibe and energy. The same thing goes for Sokka and Katara so far. In the first episode, some stuff at the southern water tribe village was left out, which is fine since it was not so important for the plot, in the original too. They did remove the role of Gran Gran wanting Aang to leave. She is just a plot explainer. I do not mind this fact at all, as her role was now given to Suki's Mother in the next episode.I liked Zuko and Uncle Iroh in the first episode. After watching this episode I hoped there would be more interaction between them and the crew (luckily got that later). In general, I have to say the episode felt just a bit rushed, with a lot of things happening in a short period. I wish there was more time in the village. Aang reaction to the situation and his denial were good but I would have liked more development time for him and his relationship with Katara and Sokka. But as a first episode, the plot felt round and a good start to the show. I also liked the bending visuals (especially the earth bending in the beginning).The VFX just look crips and that is important for a show that is relying so heavily on them. What I also really appreciate is the cruelty of some of the fights. They do not hesitate to show people burning and dying. Of course, they won't show any extreme violence so I like the way they are going for here. One thing that confused me was Aang's ability to fly without his staff. If this is possible why would he even need that? This would also put a lot of plotholes in the future story. Maybe I am wrong and he was just decelerating his falls but it looked weird.I was kind of disappointed by the second episode, especially by the relationship between Suki and Sokka. It felt so weird somehow. They did not talk very much, and if they did, I was feeling kind of awkward. The romance was just not fleshed out and I am really sad about this. The entire episode just felt pretty rushed. I did like the interaction between Zhao and Zuka but was a bit sad that we didn't get to see an Agni Kai (got the fight between them later luckily).I am also not a huge fan of Avatar Kyoshi appearing in the real form instead of Aang. What I did like on the other hand is the new character, Suki's Mother. I like how they have some changes from the original show and how they put multiple aspects of the original show into one aspect (for example the water-bending scroll is compressed in this episode). The VFX looked great again. One thing that I noticed is the dialogue between Sokka, Katara and Aang is weird sometimes. It somehow feels unpersonal and unnatural, like they try to explain to the audience the plot or try to have some phrases for the trailers. After watching this episode I was just hoping the relationship between Yueh and Sokka will be better.The Show rebounded with the Omashu Episodes, although it is still very rushed and a lot of things are happening at the same time. I think a lot of characters are not necessary. They should have focused on fewer instead of trying to put everyone from the original show into this one, while some have a very insignificant part in the plot. I was hoping they would give some new details and development for characters that were not in the original show.While I do like Sokka in this show and his jokes, I find the humour in general a bit forced and not very natural. I am not so sure about the cast of Azula, but this remains to be judged in upcoming episodes and seasons. One thing I have to mention is how I had to laugh loudly after I saw the look of Fire Nation spies in omashu. How can a spy look so obviously shady and have a red cloak?Trying to put multiple parts of the original show in one storyline leads to some parts feeling incomplete. I feel like Zuko's development feels very rushed. In the original show, Zuko in the first season was just this aggressive, hunting avatar maniac, while here he is already making developments have facing tough choices. He does not feel like the villain he was in the original.I do like that we see a lot of Azula already and her living in the Fire Nation with his father. What I did not need was the crew of Jet. Or at least the cast of it. It felt kind of weird seeing a 10-year-old fighting against firebenders (who burn and kill in this show). But on the other hand, I have to remind myself that the whole gang are children. I did like Jet, he is very similar to the Jet we saw in the original.What I did not like was the tunnel story with Sokka and Katara. I get why they didn't want Aang and Katara to show romantic emotions (yet?), but the Love thing just didn't work with Sokka and Katara. In my opinion, they could have just left this out. The only thing I think it tried to show is the original of Omashu (not sure if this was necessary) and the origins of Earthbending I guess with the badger moles. Which could also be explained later with the arrival of Toph.In the fifth episode, they finally took some time with the plot and focused on one topic. But I am not so sure I liked it. The spirit world was cool to see and I like how they reused Koh in this show but I'm not sure that Katara and Sokka needed to be in the spirit world, though it of course did work out well in the story.I have to double down on my take that the dialogue feels very unnatural at times, again for example when the gang is discussing or in this episode when Gyatso is talking to Aang. What I did like on the other hand is the comeback of the blue spirit, which was built in very cleverly and the conversation between Aang and Zuko after the escape. Here Zuko stays true to his character in the original show.I also liked the storyline with Zuko being banned from the Fire Nation and the arc with his crew. This was something new and felt very refreshing. Here we also already got more to see about Ozai which is very good for the upcoming seasons.I liked the Season Finale. The fight was great and they stayed very close to the plot in the original. My main focus was on Yueh and Sokka. And I have to say it is kind of meh. While it feels better than his encounter with Suki, I wish Yueh and Sokka had gotten more screen time to get to know each other and develop their relationship. Again it felt rushed. I still think the end was well executed and I felt something, there was potential left on the table for them. Of course, they kept the Katara - Paku storyline which I didn't mind.I'm not sure why they left out the end, where Aang, Katara and Sokka save Zuko, because this was a very crucial moment in the show for the development of Zuko, but it remains to be seen.I do hope they make more than 3 seasons x 8 episodes as this already felt very rushed. And in the next seasons, a lot of important things are happening and in my opinion, fewer things that can be left out or even be shortened.I feel like it made a lot of sense to not mention the comet yet (except at the end), as the show can take a lot of time in the next season for things to develop. Also, the cast will age, so it won't be possible to let the events happen in 8-9 months like in the original show.I think they could have gone more into detail with some storylines. I think 1-2 more episodes would have been great to do that. But all in all, as a huge ALTA fan, I was pleased with the result.Feel free to give me feedback or respond to my though.","rating":"7\/10","date":"24 February 2024"}
{"title":"It was never going to live up to fans' expectations","review":"Any series as loved as ATLA will never live up to expectations. Honestly, the expectations of most fans are probably unfair. Adapting a cartoon into a great live action is nearly an impossible task. That doesn't mean this isn't worth the watch. I'm reading a lot about the lack of humor. It's true, but I don't really mind that. It's kind of cool to see a more grounded live action. Not better, just different, and that's ok. If you're a superfan, and anything short of absolute fidelity will disappoint you, then you're going to be disappointed. If you're 20 years older, and you've already watched the cartoon version with your kids, give it a shot.","rating":"8\/10","date":"4 March 2024"}
{"title":"Loved the effort tho","review":"The characters are picked really nice, the acting is on a bit of a low side but one thing is absolutely OFF : THE LIGHTING. It feels in every step of the way that everything was recorded in a studio and lights crew completely failed at the job, feels absolutely soulless.I kinda don't care about changing the stories - eventually, they did fit the whole book in a few episodes, what else do you expect? Plus, it's the first season, they still need some time for the arcs of the characters to develop.Absolutely loved Zuko, the actor gave the character some complexity which he lacked in the beginning of the cartoon series.","rating":"7\/10","date":"10 March 2024"}
{"title":"Don't hate","review":"I was part of the generation where I would wait week to week either to watch\/rewatch any episode of Avatar the last Airbender, and I know the movie was discontinued but I enjoyed it (try debate me)But I genuinely enjoyed it for the sentiment, and was disappointed when I was left with a story unfinished (not to mention the actors who were left with a sense that they hadn't been as good for their roles)I personally enjoy anything to do with Aang, Korra or if the creators decide to make an Earthbending avatar, I watch both series each year.Don't ruin the potential of the Netflix series (too many have been cut too short) from a fan who's watched the series and read the comics.","rating":"10\/10","date":"27 February 2024"}
{"title":"Avatar: The Last Adaptation","review":"To be honest I entered the Netflix adaptation of atla very reluctantly. After hearing of the departure of the original creators and knowing it would be difficult to put 20 episodes of content into 8, I wasn't very hopeful.A last, my worries were warranted. The acting was subpar across the board, the chemistry was missing between our main trio, and the delivery of lines was laughable at times. The VFX looked pretty wonky at times (except the final episode) and took me out of the immersion of the show plenty.The story was too fast paced, and the build up of plot points and relationships weren't satisfying. We often saw the cross section of multiple separate plotlines being brought together in an episode, and while I'm not directly opposed to this idea, the execution was what was off.This show also did a pretty terrible job with exposition dumps(I'm looking at you Gran Gran). And while the show did take some creative liberties with the plot(Having Azula being the one feeding Zhao information), I felt like more should have been taken to make the plot flow better and giving long times fans more of a reason to keep watching, given that they already know the main plot points.Overall Netflix Avatar The Last Airbender wasn't a complete train wreck. While I do have many gripes with the show, I still felt pretty entertained throughout for the most part, and the final episode was a huge redeeming factor for the whole season for me. Im curios to see how season 2 and 3 go and I will be watching\/","rating":"6\/10","date":"18 March 2024"}
{"title":"A Spectacular Blend of Action and The Story","review":"For someone who didn't watch the cartoon but knew a little bit about the story, this show is spectacular-easy to understand and follow. While I enjoy action and fantasy shows, I particularly appreciate it when they convey meaningful messages, as skillfully done in every episode of this series. The actors did a phenomenal job, and the fighting scenes are all amazing. Moreover, this show provides the opportunity to connect emotionally.I highly recommend it for those who dreamt of receiving their Hogwarts letter or possessing superpowers, akin to Sailor Moon or Sakura Card Captors. Give it a chance :)","rating":"10\/10","date":"27 February 2024"}
{"title":"Good Visuals, Poor Actings and Story","review":"Visuals are pretty good, more than i imagine. Unfortunately cant say for the story and acting... That live action is like 'lets do an Avatar serie with awesome effects but forget about the original story, actually lets forget about anything about an any storie'. Since the anime is pretty short to make its live action without any problem, the result disappointed me. First couple episodes was good to watch but it gets worse. I hope producers read comments and listen. And the last thing and most important: Someone has to say to Aang: 'You should stop these meaningless mimics, this is not an Indian drama!'","rating":"6\/10","date":"28 February 2024"}
{"title":"Fan or the original and fan of this","review":"I really enjoyed it. Small changes make it flow well as a live action. I think the people who don't like it were already primed to not like it. I watched it with friends who never saw the original and they liked it just as a show with no context. I think that the cast will also get better as they go along. They are just getting their feet on the ground. Uncle Iroh is just sooo good. Love the actor. Same with Sokka and zuko. Actually they all are pretty good. Also idk why this review has to be so long. Anyway it was good and the hater are just sad they arnt children anymore and everything's not 1:1 from the show. But if they did a 1:1 they would find something else not to like.","rating":"10\/10","date":"27 February 2024"}
{"title":"About the same as Live Action One Piece","review":"I liked this show about as much as I liked the live action One piece. It seems to be a harmless remake that does still stick to the source material but includes extra additions that just get revealed later in the original show anyways. There are one or two things I couldn't really get behind, but the pros still outweighed the cons. Between this show and One Piece though, One piece was better. But this is still a thousand times better than the 2010 film. If I had to sum it up in a sentence, it would be the same as One Piece live action: The show is good, but the cartoon\/anime is still the goat of the franchise.","rating":"7\/10","date":"25 February 2024"}
{"title":"Where is Aang's humour and flair?","review":"No humour or passion from Aang's actor. The animation is very nice, but the story is just different in al the wrong ways.!spoilers!Already in the first episode it goes all wrong. In the original Aang is so overwhelmed bij the news he is the avatar and has to leave his mentors and friend that he decides to run away. A real heathfellt moment. In the new series he just \"Oh I'm the avatar and dont want to. Im going to fly a bit with appa for a couple of minutes\". It just doesnt feel the same. The voice of the new Aang is just all wrong. He is just only mumbeling and I cant even hear him say anything.","rating":"1\/10","date":"22 February 2024"}
{"title":"Good but with not it's flaws","review":"For me I watch the original show and I love it and I do agree that it lack the joy and humor. Which made the original a masterpiece,some of the changes that they made were fine. What would have made them great if they made sure that what they change to adapt the story Modern audiences with a little more care. In stead some parts fell flat and others because they took the time to make it right. For example the first two episodes were strong but the 4th and 3rd episodes fell flat. Then final 4 bits and pieces were strong but some of it was not quite as strong. Overall this show is good but with flaws.","rating":"7\/10","date":"26 February 2024"}
{"title":"A very interesting surprise","review":"The truth is that this series has been a revelation. In a matter of one night I completed more complete series. It has a prefect CGI, an impressive dialogue, an even better interpretation. The techniques used for the realization of the series have been invincible, (more than 100 different scenarios).I don't know if I'll be the only one wishing you for a second season. I also loved the perfect harmony that has been achieved to shoot this live-action in such a spectacular way between \"new\" actors and actors already renowned in the world of the sector.In summary, I say, that they have demonstrated a very notorious coordination and professionalism.","rating":"10\/10","date":"28 February 2024"}
{"title":"Cool but missed some important points.","review":"Casting was pretty good and they do a good job trying to follow the story in the time given. They do a good job keeping trying to keep the original premise alive but fall short in certain characters stories and development. The short time you see Roku he's not this wisdom giving sage and an important advice giver to aang like he is in the cartoon, he's kind of a clown and doesn't really live up to the role of Roku. They're rushing Azulas story and instead of the strong confident antagonist role she played in the cartoon she's immediately riddled with daddy issues and doesn't let her be the power house she was before leading to her eventual crack under pressure. They should have let her be her. Katara doesn't get her gradual development as a water bender and we don't get much from her it's just implied from a pretty cool fight scene. The biggest disappointment is they tried to give you more sensitive Zuko in the beginning when it's crucial to his original character to sort of be stuck in his selfish ways in the beginning of this story. He needs more time to struggle with himself and they make him a little too much of a good guy straight away. The actor does an amazing job as Zuko and I don't think he could have been casted better but give these character the time the story deserves for them to develop and embody the characters that we love. All in all not bad but I can see why the creators backed out. But much much better than I expected. I'm looking forward to the other seasons and what they do with it. The bending and special effects are awesome.","rating":"6\/10","date":"24 February 2024"}
{"title":"Ever played the games or watched the cartoon. This was great.","review":"This review is from someone that has read the name from a video game. I'm not interested it cartoons or anything nickelodeon, as it's for kids. I came in with low expectations and this is the best series I've watched this year. The story was great, the effects were great and so were the actors. This quality of this could easily have been a film I liked the uncle as he had a very good relationship with the prince. The king of the fire benders is a brilliant actor and that showed here. It would be a crime for this not to get a second season. I had give up on good scripts being written and as a newcomer this was great.","rating":"10\/10","date":"28 February 2024"}
{"title":"Watch to say you've seen it","review":"While the visual effects, set design, and some acting (namely Dallas Liu, Daniel Dae Kim, and Paul Sun-Hyeong Lee) is good, the show is an overall let down for avatar fans. It's okay to change and add things: Showing the Air Nomad Genocide was great, I was fone placing the freedom fighters, Teo and Sai, and Bumi all together in the 2x Omashu episodes to save time, even limiting the Avatars ability to connect with past lives only at the shrines didnt bother me.Where the series really suffers is overlooking the characters and foregoing opportunities for them to shine and come close for expository monologes that didn't even save time. This is especially apparent when Bumi (who in this version is bitter and crusty) chastises Aang for being concerned with nothing but games while ignoring responsibility. However, the Aang we see does not penguin sled, ride the koi fish at kyoshi, throw fruit cakes on monks, or any other childish games that we are told he is apparently wrongfully focused on.There are a lot of nods to fans like the cabbage merchant and secret tunnel song etc. But the plot is swapped so much that the Gaang spends so much time apart that many of the reunions feel unearned.","rating":"6\/10","date":"28 February 2024"}
{"title":"Really Great Real life adaptation","review":"Real life adaptation are never going to be same as original. The essence of real life adaptation is to bring forth the original content with augmentation where the original script has not explored. This adaptation does exactly that. Casting is impeccable, dialogue might be better, character development is great, story is not that linear but still like original story.This is far better than one piece real life adaptation. And to think same people at Netflix oversee both series. Netflix can still replace one piece team with the avatar team and they can still save the next season from failing .","rating":"10\/10","date":"27 February 2024"}
{"title":"If cartoons aren't your thing, you can watch it.","review":"...but the original is better in basically every way and you should give it a shot if you havent.This show was honestly a very mixed bag containing a lot of changes. Some of them were actually quite nice and a breath of fresh air to a series I've rewatched so many times I lost count, others were however underwhealming to put it lightly.Let's start with what this show did well:The visuals were outstanding! I am beyond impressed with how well locations, action\/ choreography and even costumes were adapted. There was never a moment that left anything to be desired in this regard. You can clearly tell where the budget went.I also loved how Iroh was being a little more confronted with his past mistakes instead of people mostly just lightly mocking him for it, especially in Episode 4.Furthermore I think Dallas Liu did a very good Job portraying Prince Zuko and his almost manic desperation to catch Aang in order to regain his honour.What really excited me was that this show was showing a few things that happened off-screen in the original. I liked learning about Fire Nation Politics early on and it was really cool to actually see Zuko fighting against his father. There was a lot of potential to explore moments like these even further and I really hope season 2 will do so.Now to the not so good stuff:Honestly. This all felt like I was being launched on a rocket through Book 1. It was over so quickly that it was kinda hard to process what I even watched here. It certainly didn't feel like an adventure of 3 kids exploring the world and slowely forming a closer bond through their experiences. They meet and then boom, they're best friends and you're supposed to believe it. Not great but in all fairness the creators had to compress an entire season into just 8 episodes. It was obvious some sacrifices would be made.The dialogue also left a lot to be desired. The original series often worked with implications through context and... well... actually showing emotion instead of having characters telling you how they feel. ...which to be fair is still better than all the exposition dumping that was going on here. All of this could've been forgivable if characters were given any further lines, but nope, that's basically all you get. Unfortunately it didn't help making the friendship of the three main characters feel any more believable.Then there is the trap the awful 2010 Movie already stepped into: You have some of the jolliest, playful and funny characters ever on TV (Aang, Sokka & Iroh) and for some reason you suck all of this personality and energy out of them and turn them into overly serious, almost depressed shells of who they actually are. I know the writers were going for \"a more serious tone\" but if you have to re-write so many characters so fundamentally to archieve this, it really begs the question if you should've done it to the Avatar IP to begin with. Not a fan.At least Aang actually still felt like a kid in this adaptation, so I guess it's not as bad as in the Movie (though that isn't exactly an archievment).What didn't help was that they deleted some major character traits for political reasons which ended up kinda missing the point of the original. I get that it's hard to make any progressive statements in today's environment with fabricated online outrage coming your way the moment you try to make the simple point that sexism is indeed bad by showing it for example. But if that is scary, then why adapt media that relies so heavily on it to make that very point? The original gave us some of the strongest female characters of it's era while teaching valueable lessons about respecting female strength and in my humble opinion those hold up a lot better than what was done here....and finally:\nWhat in god's name was Episode 5??? Katara and Sokka are all of a sudden able to visit the spirit world? Why exactly was such a fundamental change to the rules of the original necessary here? At least give me a good explaination what this does for the plot...\nAlso: If you want to adapt Aangs spiritual journey from the original \"Winter Solstice\"-Episodes why is the Forest-Spirit \"Hei Bai\" being reduced to nothing more than a side note when he was the reason Aang makes the journey to begin with? ...and why is he then entirely replaced by \"Koh\"? I get it, it was cool to see Koh in CG but he didn't really have any business being here considering the plot.Aside from all of this: Sokka's Dad not believing in his Son before making him his proxy as the leader of the tribe (!!!) while he ventures off with the other men to fight the fire nation is not only a little bit of a head scratcher but also really bitter to watch considering their relationship in the original.Over all the weakest episode by far. Luckily Episode 6 makes up for a lot of it, especially through it's action.So yeah... There are a lot of problems with this show but it isn't really \"bad\" either. The original show is extremely hard, if not impossible to live up to and I am for the most part glad this adaptation didn't repeat the catastrophe the 2010 Movie was. I didn't regret watching this show and I will for certain watch the second season, I just think it could've been better given the source material. Having watched this show really makes me wonder if any ATLA related media will ever manage to recapture the magic of the original or if the franchise would be better left untouched as it is.Well... I can at least always rewatch the original, which is precisely what I am going to do now.","rating":"6\/10","date":"3 March 2024"}
{"title":"Just like the cartoon","review":"I feel like the original- cartoon should be set at a ten!! I think this show is an eight (my opinion) ! ! It is up there, but it does not compare to the original Nickelodeon-show!! This series has shown more drama with the story lines and added extra sub-context to certain characters, which doesn't hurt the storyline, but adds to it!! Certain characters, have their story portrayed and the writers added to the characters stories, which makes you love the characters more!! I think it's a great re-creation to the original Nickelodeon Cartoon!! It's definitely better than the M. Night Shymalan movie, because Netflix's is creating episodes and not shoving everything into a 90 minute movie!!","rating":"8\/10","date":"24 February 2024"}
{"title":"Not what I expected","review":"First of all I would really like to know what audience they had in mind , children, teens or adults , it's like they couldn't make up their mind.I'm watching this because I just love fantasy especially with nowadays cgi , but it's the only reason I am still watching after 2 episodes . Don't know if it's the actors or the script , but I have no feelings at all for the characters . Every line they say is as if they are giving a speech instead of just talking , and I'm really fed up with Aang saying \"I am the Avatar\"for the 100th time.The cgi is fantastic though , great scenes , and the fighting is also well done.I'll keep watching , mainly because of hope it will get better.","rating":"6\/10","date":"18 March 2024"}
{"title":"Trying to be the new one piece","review":"Growing up, I never watched anime. I started of by watching this one when i was like 18, i loved it. It was amazing. The characters and story was so well written. But that's it, this show is for kids. It's about kids going on an adventure to stop the fire king to take over the world. Which in my opinion is like all anime's. They are trying to make this like the one piece live action and it sucks cause this show will never be as good as that one.They tried, but flopped heavy with this tv show. If you really want a good anime or good show to watch, go watch the live action one piece. It is way more accurately represented and the acting, cgi, everything just better. This show is for children and it should be just for that.","rating":"2\/10","date":"22 February 2024"}
{"title":"Good but not even close to the original","review":"Of course i already knew this show would not be as good as the original, though I couldn't help but create expectations and anxiety awaiting for the release date. VFX are great especially fire and air bending. Earthbending and waterbending were not as good but definitely miles better than m night shyamalan movie. The main problem was obviously that they had to squeeze near 20 episodes into only 8. The pacing feels off for people who already knew the series with a lot of character arcs being mixed together and feeling confusing at times. Some changes and expansions were appreciated like the add of the air nation genocide in the start for example. But some changes were at the least confusing and at the worse completely unnecessary. I really like aang and sokkas casting i think they fit perfectly for their roles. Unfortunately I didn't really like katara's acting which was kinda a turn off for me. In general I like this show because I already was such a huge fan of the anime but I felt like it could be much better. Waiting for season 2 to see what they are going to do with it.","rating":"6\/10","date":"28 February 2024"}
{"title":"1000 times better than the movie","review":"After watching the whole series I can safely say that the series lacks one key element and that element is acting.The only problem are the actors. Their dialogue delivery isn't good at all, but what can we expect when the studio must cast only asian and by asian I mean only asian descendents.English doesn't look like their native language or mother tongue.The visuals are stunning, especially the locations.The story has deviated quiet substantially from the original series.But I still like it, not that I love it the way I love the original series.That animated series is unparallel to any series I have seen so far, and I have seen a lot of them.The problem with the adaptation is that it's almost impossible to make a live action series just like the original animated series. Even with all the technology which they have.It's the same like you can't make a good live action movie of Aladin.Nothing can capture the accense of the original animated movie.But my full marks goes to the studio and creators for at least trying their utmost efforts.This series is a must watch for all the fans of original series.","rating":"9\/10","date":"22 February 2024"}
{"title":"This show follows closes to original Main story But It lacks the Sprit of Original Show","review":"TLDR; I enjoyed the first season and I hope to see more But You shouldnt get your hopes up So You wont get dissappointed. It aint great nor it is as terrible as the movie.What I like; It has good VFX much better than I expected, Since plot of Original show was great and This one also follows it closely Thus It is great. It has that nostalgia feeling of old friend which I enjoyed. Also, Some of the added plot is not that bad.What I dont like; It may share the plot with Original show but It lacks the spirit. Sometimes, It tries to mimic scenes from original show but It falls flats to its face Because It is live action show not an animation. And They could\/should have write to better fit script to live actions nature of the show. On other times, It tells too much, instead of showing like the original show or any great movie. Acting is often too cartoonish and It doesn't feels real.I can add many of my disappointments to these but I dont think I can add much more stuff to what I like about this show. So Despite all of my disappointments I enjoyed it And If You some time to kill, you can enjoy it as well.","rating":"6\/10","date":"24 February 2024"}
{"title":"It's the movie!!!","review":"I think they just made an adaptation of the M Night Shammalamma Ding Dong movie and not the show we all know and love. I was barely able to sit through the first episode and fell asleep watch the 2nd episode. It's terrible !!! No bonding of characters, no life in the acting, it's like watch a high school reproduction of the show. They butchered it !! Nothing flows it all seems forced. All the great reviews people are posting are fakes !! No fan would ever write a good review of this show. If you want honest reviews read the ones who rates the show low!! Where's the penguin sledding? :( sad day.","rating":"10\/10","date":"22 February 2024"}
{"title":"Less than mediocre.","review":"I agree with some of the other reviewers who said this show had some good VFX and it was scenic. However, it had a lot of issues. For starters, there was no comedy or humor. It was just actors delivering lines in a robotic sense. Secondly, the cast was terrible in their roles. I couldn't enjoy any kf the show because it was so awful. Now compare this show to One Piece and you'll know exactly what I am talking about. This first season felt very rushed and there wasn't anything to enjoy. The writers had writers block on this show and it's very evident. The show is much better than the movie but it was sooooooooo boring, it hardly kept me engaged. The three main lead roles were awful so they need some training. The direction needed work as well. There's a lot of issues with this show. A solid 6 for this.","rating":"6\/10","date":"25 February 2024"}
{"title":"Great adaptation","review":"So, this show is good. It's pretty enjoyable, especially for an adaptation of a very well loved franchise.There are some changes made to the story, likely to simplify it. Most of which I'm okay with. Some events and locations are combined, some are altered slightly. I watched the anime in advance of this, and don't recall any major differences between the anime and this adaptation.Some storylines were altered too much, like the Spirit World were Aang seeks out Roku. That was changed quite a bit, becoming less about the Forest Spirit and more about Koh, eliminating the eclipse and manifesting Roku altogether.That said, the cast was very good. I'm not sure if I would replace any of them. The characters were how I imagined them as real people.Overall, I think this is a very good adaptation, better than most anime adaptations I've seen.","rating":"8\/10","date":"24 February 2024"}
{"title":"All the potential, ruined by the fast pace","review":"This show has all the potential of the original series. Some things are really good such as Avatar Kyoshi, Uncle Iroh, the Spirit World, the visuals, and a lot of the casting is really spot on.It is all, however, let down by the insanely fast pace. Multiple plotlines, episodes and locations are mashed together. The result is characters not given proper time to develop and interact. Important moments fly by, insufficient build up ruins the payoff.The great episode from the series featuring Roku and his shrine are reduced to a couple of scenes. Roku in general was a huge miss. His serious mentor vibe from the original show is reduced into an off-brand Iroh.The visuals are extremely good.The uncensored gore and violence really adds well to the show. The horrors really make you feel for the characters and the world at large.","rating":"7\/10","date":"26 February 2024"}
{"title":"Fan of the original but open to this adaptation!","review":"I am amazed of how this show started, the details that were not in the original being added was clever. I watched the original time and time again and the lines said were pretty much word for word. This is as good as an adaptation as you can get. I only started watching episode one and cannot wait to watch more episodes. It is 100 times better than the movie in the first few minutes. The bending looks great and as expected in live action. Haven't seen Momo yet but Appa looks visually stunning. Gordon plays Aang well without trying too hard and looking corny. Katara & Sokka looks spot on even with the facial expressions & mannerisms. I had to give this a 9 because the original deserves a 10 imo. I'm already hoping for season two! Definitely don't want this to end like the movie please finish the story!","rating":"9\/10","date":"23 February 2024"}
{"title":"Character development.... Erh!!!","review":"Okay so I love the animation and was really thrilled about movie adaptation but after watching, I'm really not feeling it the way I felt the original series. For starters, the characters are too serious. Reasons why I loved the animation was because of how witty and funny it was and it has a certain innocence to it but this movie adaptation is just too somber and lacking in depth. Aang is not as funny or innocent as he should be, Katara isn't too good with capturing deep facial expressions, and the biggest disappointment of it all is Sokka. He's suppose to be the funniest but he's kind of the most boring of the three.Only good thing about the series is the visuals and actions. Overall, I think Netflix could have done better.","rating":"6\/10","date":"25 February 2024"}
{"title":"Good effects but...","review":"As someone who thinks the animated series is flawless, I knew this wouldn't live up but still wanted to give it a fiar chance. Visually the show looks great, but the acting and writing are lacking. When I first saw the casting I was excited and had hope for the new series. However, many of the young actors struggled with simple scenes let alone the heavy emotions these characters go through. They overall came across as flat. It didn't help that the script was clumsy. Even the more experienced actors struggled to make the writing compelling. I think if it were my younger self watching it, I'd be a fan since the bending was well done.","rating":"4\/10","date":"24 February 2024"}
{"title":"Great !","review":"I was so disappointed by the reviews I saw that were old like old watching this but that's not the part that threw me they are leaving reviews for a tv series for kids as if it's a childhood movie they were waiting years to see. From a child's perspective my kid loved it! Super seceded his expectations it's all he talks about and I'm glad he has something to look forward to watching, very normal compared to other shows and friendly I even found myself glancing over like omg he did what! Exactly like the tv series, I loved it. You guys did a great job! I hope this series stays, I enjoyed watching W\/ my kid.","rating":"10\/10","date":"23 February 2024"}
{"title":"Wish it was longer","review":"Sokka, Katara and Yue should've had blue contacts on but not big deal. I just wish there was more episodes and longer action scenes, I know there prob a good reason why that is like budget or time. Either way it ended up making it feel compacted fitting everything in, some things that didn't seem necessary to leave in. Putting the context of multiple segments of the animated series into 1 episode makes the viewers experience feel like it's lacking depth in the display of the journey. I am stretching sentences to make the review length requirements. Anyways it's still a great show and like other reviews say you shouldn't compare it so closely to the animated series.","rating":"8\/10","date":"8 March 2024"}
{"title":"Made me cry","review":"It was so good. First of all great casting very good actors and acting, though I don't really like how they cast Azula and especially Mei, she looks nothing like the one from the cartoon, can't believe by the way she looks she is the one that is Zuko's love interest, in the series she was kinda 'cool', had charm and grace and was keeping to herself if you know what I mean.A lot of scenes really hit me and left me with tears. The series knows how to move you. It was also really beautiful, the quality of the series is superb, the cities, the effects, the realness, the animals. Really impressed with how they creatively used the different story elements from the cartoon and combined them to the series it now is, with succes I think. I really enjoyed watching it. However because of that compactness, it also felt kinda rushed as a whole, for example lot of different storylines now all taking place at once in Omashu. I think the show should've been double as long. That way some storylines, characters, trainings could've been shown more.","rating":"10\/10","date":"25 February 2024"}
{"title":"Shyamalan was Po-tay-To, this is Po-tah-To.","review":"Even before I watched the first episode, I had been saying it during the teasers and trailers that it should not mess up the humor because the original animation was so \"lively\" because of just that. Now after watching the disappointing first season, I can rightly say - most cookie points are lost just because of the humor.The storyline wiggles at most places. Even when you try to shut the original and watch this Live Action as a new piece, characters come and go as if they are \"placed\" in the show just to give them a tribute or an honorable mention. Zhao, Bumi, The Mechanist, Jet & the Freedom Fighters, Mai, Tai Lee, Suki, Avatar Kyoshi, and other secondary characters are just there serving no purpose, sometimes making no sense also. Revealing Fire Lord Ozai was a huge risk, since he was seen in the teaser too, and now having Azula and Ozai not just seen, but also serving no purpose has made Zuko's storyline blotched.The White Lotus society carries a big part in the original, and here, Iroh and Bumi (ironically, together) yet don't even acknowledge each other is just plain bad writing. Story of Oma and Shu, the lack of urgency of Winter Solstice, the lack of built up for up Avatar Roku, Aapa's connection with Aang, everything feels haywire. Even if you close the animated chapter, and try to watch this as a separate entity, it falls flat on its face.Maybe Dallas Liu as Zuko fares well since he is the most driven, and even sounds like Dante Basco from the original. Ian Ousley as Sokka is watchable, bearable but his character is just plain boring. Worst are the leads, Gordon Cormier as Aang, and Kiawentiio as Katara - they lack the zeal, their character arcs look confusing, and they don't behave like children but robotic adults.I could find little or no saving grace for this. Fight sequences are sporadic and forced, and the \"Avatar Culture\" that all of us Arrowheads are so acquainted with, is tainted. I have had enough of these Live Action, NO SEASON 2 PLEASE!","rating":"1\/10","date":"22 February 2024"}
{"title":"If you let go of the original show, you'll love it.","review":"It's an amazing show, a visual masterpiece. The nailed nearly everything from the original show, the essence, the humor, the adventure. King Bumi is by far the greatest casting of the show. I was almost in tears from all nostalgia. The visuals were incredible, and the bending was perfect to fine. The writing could use some improvement next season, but that's simply nitpicking. For everyone hating on the show, I believe they're just having a hard time adjusting. The negative reviews will blow over soon, as they're mostly coming from the loud minority group. I can't wait to see what the show cooks for the next seasons.","rating":"10\/10","date":"23 February 2024"}
{"title":"So much better than I thought it'd be!!","review":"It was beautiful in every way. The music, the visions. The places coming to life. The characters to me are brilliant, almost. There are a few that aren't quite right, but then again those characters are the in the toppers of tiers for characters in any show so there's now way any one could replicate that in acting.I loved all the changes, for the most part, we will see how season two goes if we get one!I think Aang is so cute and adorable.I think Sokka is a little more mature in this love adaptation but I am okay with it actually.Katara to me is spot on.It might my favorite shows to real life and I couldn't love it more.","rating":"10\/10","date":"24 February 2024"}
{"title":"Better than I hoped for","review":"My expectations going in were sub. But boy o boy we are getting somewhere. I am only one episode in and I can go to sleep now knowing I will be having a blast watching this.The perfection of the original series makes every attempt at making a real movie near impossible but oh my goodness, someone really took their time to match every character with a real world match. Lots of times it feels as though I am rewatching the original, that is how good it is.Many parts of the original that were simply glossed over in the animated version are elaborated on here with lots of background information you wished you had in the original iteration of this master piece of fantasy.","rating":"9\/10","date":"22 February 2024"}
{"title":"Much better than movie and excellent beginning","review":"Avatar the last airbender is my childhood tv cartoon or anime whatever it is called... Anyway the movie released in 2010 was really dissapointment for me with very bad effects and storyline. However, it is great to see my favourite childhood cartoon in live action. I must admitt that this was much better than movie. I loved actors by the way. They are really good and good choice fir their characters. Effects are really good especially firebending effects. Zuko and Iroh are acted really good by their actors and I appreciated that. I recommend avatar fans this live action series and i am very curious now for the next seasons. Beginnig with firelord Sozin and attack southern air temple was really cool and showing Aang's past was very good. I think I am satisfies for now. I am waiting for next seasons.","rating":"10\/10","date":"22 February 2024"}
{"title":"A more polished version of the m shamalan movie","review":"If you love ATLA you should skip this show ... they butchered the main characters and messed up key character building moments... changed a lot of key characteristics and added weird unnecessary stuff ...\nAnd more than anything they just couldn't do sokka and uncle iroh and azula... like is itbthat hard to actually write a funny sarcastic sokka and not make him an angry a**hole.uncle iroh and azula is just flat ... where is uncle irohs charm? Where is azulas attitude her smirk the cunning words!!! They didn't need to do anything extra ... the writing was already there how can you just fail twice in the same thing?? It just show they just didn't even try ... just poured a lot of money for vfx thinking that will make it good automatically.","rating":"1\/10","date":"22 February 2024"}
{"title":"Definitely WORTH WATCHING!!!","review":"I generally don't write reviews but for this one I'm doing. The show made a decent attempt at showing what the animated series theme was about by adapting it to the live action style. Personally, I loved this show, the graphics are stunning, the story is good, but trying to compare it with animated series is just not right. The shoemakers did an excellent job from their end. Actors were all spot on, they did their best. I hope we get to see the same kind, if not more of this writing, cgi, etc for the upcoming seasons. All in all, the show will definitely keep you hooked throughout the time. It's time we appreciate good shows like this, while some may think the show could be better, maybe it could. But what we have seen is not bad my any means. Let's not discourage the actors, show makers to not renew this for the next seasons!!!","rating":"10\/10","date":"24 February 2024"}
{"title":"Awesome different perspective","review":"Sequences that portrayed another point of view, when compared to the original, where of elevated quality and provided us with a view of beloved characters and submerged us in a different perspective of the whole lore of this amazing world of ATLA. Though parts were not described exactly as how they seemed in the original, the magical world and main story was not lost and rather was elevated and well structured in this vast world. You guys all rocked the directing, acting, costume, scenery, music, etc, and one can see the love of real ATLA fans giving us an amazing new perspective. Keep it up and looking forward to more seasons!!","rating":"10\/10","date":"24 February 2024"}
{"title":"Decent Adaptation that is good but not pretty good.","review":"Although I gave the show 8 stars out of 10, I must admit that it's more like 7.5 stars. I do like the show, but I must say that it would have been considered a pretty good show if I didn't have any prior knowledge about the original show. However, with my prior knowledge, I see it as a good show, but not pretty good.The show certainly has its strong points. The production quality is great, and the acting is okay. The adaptation of the original show is decent. However, there are some aspects that could have been improved.In my opinion, the show needs to be a little bit more aligned with the original, not necessarily a recreation, but a little bit more aligned. The current adaptation is good, but it could've been better. I hope that in season 2, the producers take note of this feedback and make some adjustments to the show. If they manage to make the necessary changes, it would be amazing to see the show reach its full potential.","rating":"8\/10","date":"24 February 2024"}
{"title":"Amazing.","review":"I don't know why people are so hard on the creators, maybe because the last avatar movie was absolute garbage. This one was amazing. I wish it would have been slower pace, more character development & maybe more humor but honestly they did so good with this. I'm sure we all wish that it was nearly exact to the cartoon version but honestly it's giving a lot more excitement in watching it. If it was the exact same, i don't think it would have been as interesting by any means. I've been a fan for many many years & i can say it most definitely upheld my expectations. I really really hope they renew for a season 2 & 3. I hope they take it to a season 4 so that we can all get the answers to Zuko's mother.","rating":"10\/10","date":"28 February 2024"}
{"title":"unlovable characters horrible acting","review":"I don't understand what they were thinking. This is incomparable to the cartoon. The acting is terrible; it is like watching a high-school play. The one thing this show did right was the effects. The characters are unlovable and unfunny. Most Characters are not anything like how they are in the cartoon. This is most true for uncle Iroh; they did him so dirty. Iroh is the polar opposite of how he is in the original. Sokka is alright; Zuko is alright. Aang is unfunny and just bad at acting. Katara isnt hot headed enough. Overall this is one of the worst possible outcomes of this tv show. Unlovable characters and bad acting.","rating":"2\/10","date":"23 February 2024"}
{"title":"Best live action ever","review":"I think this series is very good. It is true that this Avatar series has smaller differences compared to the animated series, but the special effects are very good and really great. I am satisfied with the choice they made for acting, but I am happy after watching the first episode. I was hyped and I am very eager for Netflix to continue this series\nAnd please, I ask you to do less live action hits because it is clear that the actors have worked very hard for martial arts and Netflix spent eleven million dollars for each episode, and you must watch this series on Netflix. I really liked the fight scene in the last episode.","rating":"10\/10","date":"22 February 2024"}
{"title":"A good adaptation of book 1 overall","review":"Like all live-action adaptations of animes, cartoons and shows, I embarked on this journey with caution but finished this first step very hyped for more seasons.Overall a good adaptation, many references to the original show, many shots are identical even, characters characterization are very good too, portaying the different nations with different ethnicities from our world was a good choice, art style and animation are on point, for me this is not a solid 10\/10 because the good humour of the original show was forgotten... I wonder when will we get to see the rest of this, my hopes are high for netflix to adapt the other books with such quality...","rating":"9\/10","date":"22 February 2024"}
{"title":"Its an amazing live action remake","review":"To be honest I do not understand where this hatred coming from. Do this so called fans expecting frame to frame re-make ? If that is the case you will never be satisifed with any live actions in the future.I love how they have changed the story little bit in order to get all the main charectors inside the story. Its actually very creative. If someone needs excatly the same story I think they should just watch the animated series again (which I do time to time).Casting is amazing for the most parts. CGI are on point and brings the animation to life makes so amazing that you can be so nostalgic.Again, please stop the hatred. This is an amazing remake and they have done justice to the original story. So, please watch it without expecting frame to frame copy of the animation.","rating":"10\/10","date":"23 February 2024"}
{"title":"Great representation.","review":"It was great. CGI was on point. It looks just like the cartoon. Can't wait to see more. The art and costume design were accurate. I liked that they used fresh new actors with a few old veterans. Can't wait to see the epic final fight between The Fire Lord and The Avatar. This show was made for the true fans. My only take away is it seemed too rushed. They could have gone a little bit more in depth with some of the lore. It should have been 10 episodes. Other then that it was easy to follow and it wasn't complicated at all. I feel when season 2 comes out we will grow with the cast. Also spin-off.","rating":"8\/10","date":"23 February 2024"}
{"title":"Where is the personality of the characters?","review":"While the opening of the first episode was great exceeded my expectations. I love the visuals on the choreography of the bending, it was phenomenal, great. My problem is the words exchanging from one character to the other; that is what the live action fails in.The casting for Aang was done great even though he is a child actor and everyone wants to be soft but I've seen great child actors and there's a lot of work to be done there.For me the only person's who excels in the acting roles would be Prince Zuko, Princess Azula even the cabbage man did a good job, Commander Lee also did a great job. I thought the owl was poorly placed but good voice over.The share-shoe mercenary did a great job.Suki was I think one of the best casting and I like the fact that Suki's mother appeared and she was the overseer of the village and once was a kyoshi warrior well done in that aspect.And I can't forget about Appa and Momo the CGI and visuals captures them really great well done.Now for the deplorable directing and casting that I just cannot stand.Admiral Zhao is the worst! He comes across as a puppet. Admiral Zhao in the animated version, is confident cocky fearless, this man does not care and he gives off this intimidating aura. They missed the mark on Admiral Zhao because he could have been the star of the first season.They also missed the mark on Fire Lord Ozai. I think he could have been more mysterious, devious, there should have been a more evil look to him. In the live action adaptation he is too well spoken. There is just something about the way he says things even though it's supposed to come across as malicious, stern and even condescending it comes across as polite which fire Lord Ozai is not polite.They failed with so many other characters but Fire Lord Ozai and Admiral Zhao the ones that stand out. Hopefully the acting improves. I would love them to keep the maturity but also take some insights on the comments and rating of the first season.","rating":"4\/10","date":"24 February 2024"}

{"title":"Okay now..","review":"I do not understand why other reviewers are complaining about this to the point that after watching just three episodes feel that the show is good. But to say it's less than 5 stars is a little lazy. It does have great graphics, acting is descent (not bad for sure) and the story line is pretty accurate to the cartoon. As a fan of the original, as I'm sure others are wink-wink, I was skeptical at first or had low expectations because of two reason 1) the original creators backed out due to \"creative differences\" worried me about the direction of the show and 2) the review bombs I've read on forums, my god. I guess we do live in a society of complainers. Anyways great show so far.","rating":"8\/10","date":"24 February 2024"}

But then get mad if they did quote the show. Yall get mad if there's no penguins, yall get mad thinking aang already flies but he doesn't he's literally airbending so he doesn't fall so damn quickly.Not to mention the fact that you have a TWELVE year old boy as the main character memorizing all these lines and choreography and stunts, is VERY impressive. And the millennial viewers complaining and nitpicking like and old hag... yall should hear yourselves.This is why we can't have nice thingsYeah there's tweaks in the dialog and changes in timeline, but who cares!? It's the intent behind this art. Literally think of it as a different universe; same characters, same motives, and end goal. Like spider man... there's so many different spider man shows\/movies\/cartoons and yall eat that content and still find ways to enjoy it...Do the same with avatar!The avatar universe is only growing so appreciate what you have than being pessimistic.

The characters don't feel like they understand their roles.","rating":"1\/10","date":"22 February 2024"}
{"title":"Straight and True","review":"It has been some time since watching the original, but it all came flooding back. Its not just a cut and paste, it has injected a breath of fresh air (pun intended?) keeping it familiar and new at the same time.Everyone in it suits their part. I was unsure of Princess Azula to begin with, however the \"bratty\" behaviour shines through in the live action portrayal with facial expressions and body language that animation doesn't quite capture.Gyatsu, Gran Gran, Suki, Bumi, Uye, the Cabbage Guy all fantastic!If you're expecting a rush for Aang to learn everything in this season, you'll be disappointed. They're keeping the pace well and not cramming like the mistake of the Film.I think each book will be at least 2 seasons, and I hope it can make it until the end!Watch it with an open mind and I hope you're not dissatisfied!","rating":"10\/10","date":"22 February 2024"}
{"title":"Not perfect but it still works, and I enjoyed it","review":"As a long-time fan of the original animated series, I approached Netflix's live-action adaptation of \"Avatar: The Last Airbender\" with both excitement and apprehension. While not without its flaws, this interpretation managed to capture the essence of the beloved story, delivering an enjoyable and often emotional journey.The acting performances, particularly from the main cast, were commendable, considering the weight of the roles they undertook, especially given their young age. Standouts included the portrayals of Zuko and Iroh, whose complex relationship was masterfully depicted.In terms of staying true to the original storyline and character development, the adaptation succeeded in providing additional depth and insight into the Avatar universe. While some elements were missed from the animated series, the inclusion of new scenes and information added layers to the narrative.Visually, the series was stunning, with impressive visual effects that brought the bending abilities to life. Though there were moments where the CGI felt noticeable, overall, the FX artists did a commendable job.Episode 6, titled \"Masks,\" emerged as a highlight, showcasing exceptional acting and delving into the intricate dynamics between characters. However, there were instances where pacing issues hindered the storytelling, leaving certain plot points feeling rushed.One aspect that could have been improved was the portrayal of Aang's internal struggle with the weight of his responsibilities as the Avatar. While present, it felt overshadowed at times.Despite its flaws, I would wholeheartedly recommend this series to both fans of the original and newcomers alike. It offers a fresh perspective on a beloved tale and sets the stage for future seasons to further explore the rich world of \"Avatar: The Last Airbender.\"Overall, while not without its imperfections, Netflix's live-action adaptation of \"Avatar: The Last Airbender\" left me eagerly anticipating what's to come in season two.","rating":"8\/10","date":"25 February 2024"}
{"title":"Are you guys Joking?","review":"I've seen the Cartoon 3 times, and I don't know why people are not liking this as much the Cartoon. I know, the vibe is a little different but I was a kid when I saw that Cartoon and now I am all grown up and I welcome the change of the vibe. Visually it's good, everybody is agreeing on that but writing is also pretty good. And it's only gonna go better from here, those who have watched the cartoon know that, that the story ahead is gonna be more grand. Sokka and Prince Zuko's acting is great. I know all other actors are not as much good but I think show's writing and Visual can overshadow it, also let other seasons come, maybe they'll become better.","rating":"10\/10","date":"6 March 2024"}
{"title":"A well done reimagining","review":"First things first, this is based on the animation no the recreation thereof. This reimagining of Aang's story told through a new narrative brings its own tone with it. It's slightly darker, grimmer, and realistic. The casting is phenomenal! Especially Grodon as Aaang! Yes his delivery is a bit expositional and doesn't have a lot of experience but he is FOURTEEN! He did capture a lot of the original aang's charm with his childish smile and laughter, and the way he says YEP YEP!As for the story, I actually enjoyed seeing more of the Firelord's political games and being more present in the fire nation this time around. I loved seeing more of Azula's origins and how it plays with Zhao. And they cut out the fillers this time around, not that I dislike the fillers in the original, they were extraordinary! But here they're using a different outlet of story telling so they had to make some cuts. Without much spoilers, they merged a lot of story lines together for side characters like the freedom fighters and the mechanist which I think was a clever way of paying homage while having to move the story at a brisker pace.Before I move on to the visual effects, I must give a shout out to the choreography! I loved how Zuko fought and the Kiyoshi warriors and everything. It was ridiculous! They even managed to recreate some of the fights from the original with all the somersaults and flourishes and I must say they NAILED IT!Last but not least, I LOVED the set design and visual effects! I mean it was so insanely awesome to see those things and creature in real scale and I must say they KILLD IT! The owl of knowledge, Omashu, the Oasis... all of those location just looked phenomenal! And the bending was simply perfect!All in all, while this is not the original beloved animation, it stands on its own from idea to execution! CAN'T WAIT FOR SEASON 2.","rating":"10\/10","date":"24 February 2024"}
{"title":"It's good but i'ts not avatar.","review":"They've changed many little things for no reason at all, Sokka has no soul, no jokes, no comments, no life. Who is the avatar? Katara or Aang? Cause she does literally everything, which makes no sense at all, this series should be named Avatar, the legend of katara. They made her stronger than aang and this makes no sense at all.What can we say if literally every single show made in those years are like that, the main character if it is a man, it's weak, can't do anything, it's a useless piece of flesh, but every single woman is THE SUPA STRONGA, dude, really, netflix should just close their doors and never touch anything again.","rating":"3\/10","date":"23 February 2024"}
{"title":"Wow over and over","review":"I dont like cartoons so I never watched this story. I watched the movie but that was hardly the appropriate vehicle for a story like this.I wasn't excited for this show because first the hype went too hard and then because the critics were too critical.Remakes are not for fans of the original they are for new fans. I'm sorry for all the cartoon Watchers that can't enjoy this live action medium because of their previous experience but its certainly not the fault of the makers of this one.I have enjoyed every second of it and I'm glad this beautiful story is being told in a medium that I can enjoy.","rating":"10\/10","date":"8 March 2024"}
{"title":"Captured the heart of the anim\u221a\u00a9 series","review":"As a young boy, growing up with Avatar and having many things in parallel with the show I have to say that the director and team have captured the essence of what makes the show soo good. I found myself tearing up many many times and the show felt fresh for the live action drama aspect. The casting for the show was done brilliantly, alot of the actors just match the characters in the anime. Some even have a martial arts background which is why the choreography is soo brilliant. The aspects of the spirit world and bending are done specularly and I find myself emotionally invested in the story and the ever growing character development which is why the show is so brilliant.I look forward to having more tearful moments and being entertained.","rating":"10\/10","date":"15 March 2024"}
{"title":"Great","review":"It's great, visually amazing, true to the animated version. People who give low reviews has unrealistic expectations, it can't be easy doing an adaption of a show like this, but this is really well made. I was entertained all the way though and never dissapointed. The music good, the characters looks surprisingly similar to the animated characters without looking silly, enough amount of humour without loosing it's serious touch, and serious enough not to loose the great storyline. I hope they will do more seasons. I have watched the animated show several times and I don't feel dissapointed at all, Netflix did it right this time.","rating":"10\/10","date":"3 March 2024"}
{"title":"hmmm","review":"The live-action version is enjoyable enough, especially when you consider how tough it is to bring a cartoon to life. It's understandable to love the original animation - most people do! But seeing a different take on something familiar can create a built-in bias. Expecting a scene-by-scene copy in live-action might lead to disappointment. Sure, some changes are necessary when translating animation to real life, but calling this \"not good\" ignores the big differences between cartoons and real life film. Instead, it might be more fun to appreciate both versions for what they offer, rather than trying to decide which one is \"better.\"","rating":"10\/10","date":"15 March 2024"}
{"title":"An Unrewarding Shift from the Original's Charm","review":"There is no reason to compare this to that terrible movie. The comparison should only be made to the original animated series, which is a work of art.The new series misses everything that fans loved about the original series. It replaces it with a visual and unnecessary depiction of dark themes (to supposedly appear mature), and with endless, emotionless expository text. In the Netflix series, we are exposed to superficial characters who only reflect the stigma attached to the original character (and even here, the writers failed), and nothing beyond. The dialogue is thin and boring, the exposition is endless, emotionless, and logically flawed. In the original Avatar, every character had depth, emotion, logic, and comedy. Every character has a role, but they are not defined by that role alone. The characters are human. Throughout the original series, the characters develop and mature. The viewers are exposed to wonderfully written backstories, understanding their personalities. We see this through an excellent presentation of the story, not just a narrative text. In the original Avatar, there is development as a team (Team Avatar). In Netflix, each character lives in their own world! There's no camaraderie, just a superficial connection between the characters, there's nothing there! Sokka and Katara join Aang \"because they can't go back home\" suddenly-??In the original series, we have two full episodes (the first ones) that show the initial connection between the heroes, the conflict arising if Katara and Sokka leave home, and their commitment to save Aang after he sacrificed himself to protect their village. Only then does their grandmother realize their destiny to help the Avatar.Netflix lacks all of this. Katara and Sokka go to rescue Aang without explanation. Before all of that the grandmother somehow discovers Aang is the Avatar, and it adds nothing to the story depth. No one even acknowledges her. At best, this is lazy writing; at worst, it's contempt for the viewer.And that's just the first 5 minutes of the show, the rest is much worse.(I'm not comparing it to the depth of the story, so you won't have spoilers, for the animated series of course)In the Netflix series, they decided to take all the episodes, stories, and plot of season 1 (and even some of season 2, for some reason) of the original and turn them into a rotten vegetable salad. Nothing connects, unrelated things suddenly linked without logical reason. Everything is ruined. The result is that every character (remember, they were already given no chance by the writers to bond as a group) goes on a boring journey of their own, ending in especially childish and bland development, just so Netflix's distorted plot could eventually resolve. It feels as if ChatGPT wrote the series based on ideas from the original.All this before even discussing the cringeworthy acting (especially Katara, a terrible actress with strange and hesitant expressions), the generic Hollywood music (the original series had a unique, unforgettable soundtrack), and the shallow plot compared to the original.However, it seems that the actors (except for Katara and Uncle Iroh with childish acting) do try to do some justice to the show, but they received poor text with confusing directions about the emotions of the characters. Or they might not have had enough time to learn the scenes.The actors mostly do look like the animated originals.The casting is not bad; the execution is poor!The graphics are amazing, but the bending (element manipulation) should have been faster. Watch the trailer at 1.5 speed to see how it's supposed to be. (Or just watch the original!)Anyone who watches the new Avatar on Netflix without knowing the original Avatar will think it's a good series. They might rate it between 5 and 7 if they're really generous (and even that's only for the graphics) and move on with their life.But if you want a mature series, well-written, with depth, emotion, originality, and logic, a series that will touch your heart, watch the animated Avatar series of Nickelodeon.For the Netflix Avatar:\n3.5\/10, just for the graphics and the attempt to bring an amazing and beloved story to life.","rating":"1\/10","date":"23 February 2024"}
{"title":"Everyone's Hearts Are In The Right Place!","review":"Netflix, please give us a season two. All of the actors' hearts are in the right place. I've mostly enjoyed the series so far. Sure there were some unnecessary changes, but I actually thought some of these changes were for the better.Here are a few examples that come to mind. It would make sense for Bumi to be somewhat resentful towards Aang. I think this worked out nicely. The combining of Jet and the Mechanist into the same episode was very well done. The entire 41st division arc was brilliantly told. This first season of this adaptation definitely did a lot right.I will say that some of the dialogue tends to run on, but this is also a kid's show at the end of the day. As such I can understand why the writers felt the need to elaborate on or explain some things a bit more. This does lead to some awkward moments, but I am absolutely willing to look past them.I believe the casting for this adaptation is near perfect, and it is for this reason I remain hopeful we will get a season two. Make it happen Netflix!","rating":"8\/10","date":"25 February 2024"}
{"title":"Stop hating on this Amazing Remake","review":"Listen I understand it was fast, I understand they didn't include everything BUT the show introduced us to Team Avatar in a NEW way. They provided us with the BEST parts of the animated series, but did they include everything no! However, they introduced us to the series in a new and exciting way. They provided us with a new way to look at the Avatar series. The darkness of it was emotional, the character-building was intriguing, and the bending was amazing! I hate that people are hating on this, and it's because you're comparing it too much to the ANIMATED KIDS version. We're adults now! Act it.","rating":"9\/10","date":"24 February 2024"}
{"title":"This surpasses the 2010 movie flop by Tenfolds!","review":"At first I was bothered by the deviation and merging of episodes to create a new story line. However, the series gradually won me over with its unique charm. By the final season, I found myself falling in love with these characters all over again in a new way. I enjoyed when familiar lines and characters from the original were seamlessly incorporated. Example, The cabbage guy! My favorite or Iroh defending the moon spirit. Some lines are just too perfect to change!I did not give it a 10 as it just cannot be the original, I say more humor (especially from uncle Iroh) and more character development moments could have helped. I will say the emotion and love did shine through at the end.It's not easy to fill the shoes of our beloved animated friends. The pressure was real, so I want to just give a shout out to the actors. I can see the amount of dedication and passion that each actor put into bringing each character to life.As a dedicated Avatar: The Last Airbender fan, I'm eagerly anticipating what the next season will bring, especially with the introduction Toph Beifong.","rating":"9\/10","date":"23 February 2024"}

I was nervous after the travesty of a movie that came out, the live action is infinitely better. The live action ATLA lived up to my expectations and more. The casting was spot on. I loved how they kept the overall concept of the cartoon but adapted it to live action. The special effects were good and didn't take you out of the story but also didn't overtake the show. I believed it kept a good balance between cartoon and live action like the ocean and the moon. I have not one bad thing to say.

{"title":"Original creators ran away form this for a good reason it seems.","review":"Right off the bat, the show is not horrible. It's not unwatchable. It is, in fact, MILES better than the live action movie from 2010. BUT almost everything about it is easily worse than the original cartoon.Without any spoilers, the story is changed heavily. All of a sudden, the reasons why some events happen don't make sense and don't achieve the same character moments as they did in the cartoon. Stuff is condensed so much in places that the story doesn't have any room to breathe, while also adding new scenes and plot points. All of the characters, for the most part, including Aang, are extremely poorly written. The dialogue is generic. Everyone is just an exposition dump machine. Honestly, why would the show creators ever think this is a compelling way to do character development?There are a ton of complaints I can list here, but honestly, the fact that the original show creators ran away from this project during the pre-production stage should tell all of you what is going on... It is really a shame. I hope they end up making a live action version that is deserving of the original some day, not a cheap, soulless retelling of it.","rating":"3\/10","date":"24 February 2024"}
{"title":"That was literally fire","review":"Who in the world is criticizing this show. I wanna know. This was like watching the series for the first time all over. It had better cgi than most blockbuster movies, let alone series cough smallville (I'm old).Initially, I thought the actors were a little stiff trying to emulate their cartoon counterparts. However, a few episodes in and I was totally into it. Like totally. I was gonna name the actors who did the best, but I stopped. Not because I couldn't identify any actors I liked but I stopped because I found myself listing almost every actor\/character.My only criticism is the humor. Humor literally made the original. The original had a perfect balance between action, humor, and comedy.

{"title":"An excellent and honorable adaptation","review":"The live action adaptation of ALTA was something I highly anticipated, however, I remained only cautiously optimistic. Fortunately, the show delivered on every front; the martial arts, the visual effect, and the abridged adaptation of the storyline were all excellent. The cast capture the heart of what the dynamics of the original series had, while also adding something of their own, as well. As a deep fan of the original series, having watched each episode as they were released, I recognize that there are certain storylines that may not be covered in the show or certain liberties that were taken in the adaptation. I did not except, nor want, a complete frame by frame remake, and by making the adaptations that they did, I think that they made certain story points even clear than the original series may have. Very impressed and excited to see a second season... I really need to see Toph!","rating":"10\/10","date":"25 February 2024"}
{"title":"Storyline was ruined for no reason","review":"The directors took liberties just so they can say it was their own. Storyline is horrible. Graphics are good and cast is ok. The cast looked like they belonged in this world. The acting from some were hit and miss. They mushed together multiple stories, from all over the original storyline, into one or two episodes. These are pivotal parts of the story that help the viewer grow with the characters. They had plenty of time to tell the entire story of the original version and then some. They decided to make up and mix up stuff for the live action instead. The bending visuals are fantastic, though. That makes it worth watching just once. I do not want a season 2.","rating":"4\/10","date":"23 February 2024"}
{"title":"It was a good start, but needs work on pacing and story building","review":"I genuinely wanted to love this. I know how much love and care was poured into this production, but I had a few issues with the development of the show. First off Ian and Dallas playing zuko and Sokka both stole the show. They did phenomenal. The world building and effects were great. Loved azula's added back story. And overall the acting was all really good. But I felt like they were trying way too hard to over explain to new viewers that have not seen the show and it just felt like too much.It was fast paced, they threw way too much at us and I genuinely wished they just slowed down and focused on simple story telling. So much was thrown at us that at times it felt like they were trying too hard to make the fans happy, when they just needed to relax and let the material breathe a little. I mean they threw three major characters\/plots into one episode and it felt very overwhelming. Looking back now I can understand the decision of needing to find a way to get them all three into season one, and maybe I don't know enough about how the production and their perimeters with budget and what not, because I will not sit and mansplain something I know nothing about, but I feel that they needed WAY more episodes to take their time with it all. But again maybe they were given a budget of only certain amount of episodes and had to make that work. I won't get angry and assume I understand the logistics of their choices as if it would be an easy fix, cause I don't know, but I will say that less is more and you don't need to do too much for there to be an impact.Also in regards to trusting the material- I felt they were so worried the new viewers would be lost that they felt the need to explain as much as possible episode one, when realizing it's okay if everyone doesn't have all the information. I will say that the first half of season one of the cartoon was rather slow and juvenile in a way- not really picking up until over half way through, so they had time to really get the audience to slowly get to know each character and see how they grew together. Netflix had a tough job of having to speed that up while keeping it interesting. So it was a tough job to fill. But again, I really feel that focusing more on taking their time with the story more it would have helped.I also feel because there was so much thrown at us it took away from character development a little. We were so focused on moving the story forward that we lost the relationship development a little. Making it feel forced at times with character development a little. I'm not saying it was bad, it just felt forced and overwhelming at times. Zukos story episode I absolutely loved, and I'm not mad at all the changes, I just wish they would take their time, trust that new viewers will understand, and stop trying to please everyone. It's a great start if they take others criticisms into making season 2.They had a difficult task with making this. The more I breakdown their decision making, I see it. Still wish I didn't have so much thrown at me, but I get it.Im sure after a few months I'll feel different about it. Items fresh right now, so it feels different.","rating":"8\/10","date":"22 February 2024"}
{"title":"imperfect perfection","review":"This show rocks. I was skeptical after the first episode, but every scene after that it has grown on me. The changes (mechanist double agent for example) are usually well thought out, and omissions have made sense so far (i'm on episode 5). The comedy is used much more sparingly, but because of that it almost always hits. Not to mention the translation of the humor is almost perfect. Actors for Sokka and Zuko are highlights so far, I mean they even sound like them. Aang has grown on me a lot after some seriously impressive performances. Loved Bumi as well. This show stands alone, fleshing out parts of the story that the original left huge questions about. But it has that distinct feeling you only get with avatar. Thats thanks to the set pieces, the music, the effects (no thanks to some lighting and cinematography choices), and the casting. Oh and Azula, she's gonna be good.","rating":"9\/10","date":"22 February 2024"}

It's not perfect, but I still see this season as a rousing success. The visuals are excellent, the emotionality and growth of the characters is still a key part of the journey, and they managed to include pretty much every crucial plot point, while including Ozai and Azula in a natural way, despite a much shorter run time. The portrayal of Zuko was excellent.I grew up with Avatar, I watched the original as it came out when I was 7-10 years old. It's a part of me.

{"title":"Insulting to true fans","review":"I watched the whole season to be sure I gave it a fair review.. it's overall awful. The visual effects are great, but that's it. The acting is awkwardly terrible and hard to watch. Especially Aang. I don't care that they're young. I've seen 8 year olds give better performances. The next biggest issue is the CONSISTENT overexplanations. In storytelling, the saying is \"show, don't tell\". They broke that rule so much. It begs me to wonder who this show was made for. Children? The original cartoon aired in 2005. The core audience is all adults now. Next, the humor is either nonexistent or cheesy at times. The tone is too dramatic, which was a terrible decision because of the poor acting abilities. The whole season is rushed. Aang doesn't get nearly enough screen time. They instead showed more Zuko (that actor was the only good one). They took out Sokka's chauvinistic traits, which are crucial to his character development. Same with Kitara's bad attitude. Her character might as well be a different person. She was supposed to get mad Aang for being better at water bending. Aang never even learns to water bend the whole season! The whole show is essentially the fire nation play from season 3... it's like they didn't take it seriously. The one good thing I did like was episode 6. The agni kai was great. And the part about Zuko's crew was a nice addition. But I think the original creators actually wore that. So that's probably why... looking forward to them creating new episodes in the future. Lastly for context I've watched the original show in its entirety 3 times, watched Korra twice, and read all the graphic novels.","rating":"5\/10","date":"4 March 2024"}

The visual effects were astounding as wells as the costumes and makeup. We know what the story line is and the writers go out of their way to explain this through episode 1. Are there differences from the cartoon to the live action yes but most of the people handing out low reviews are nitpicking at every little thing and they should keep it to themselves. It's definitely not the cartoon but in my opinion it does more than enough to give us fans more of the show we grew up loving.","rating":"8\/10","date":"6 March 2024"}

There are story lines and plot twists and the special effects are just so good. Yeah some of the acting can be iffy but overall a really good show. If you are coming into this show expecting it to be just like the original then you are not going to like this. There are similarities yes but this is not supposed to be a take for take recreation. If you come into it knowing that it's an open adaptation and not take the animated series as gospel then this is a good one for you. By the end of the first season you can really see the growth in the acting of the characters and I think the next season will be even stronger.I can't wait to see season 2 - season 1 ended on a cliffhanger.","rating":"10\/10","date":"4 March 2024"}

Everything else, from preserving the original storyline and the characters features to the selecting actors is absolutely terrible. It's understandable that just imitating the cartoon series isn't what spectators expected from the show, but the core concepts the entire story based on shouldn't be changed in so twisted way.Let's take Azula as a proof and short example of a huge nail in the coffin. The one who's supposed to be the young prodigy, the most cold-blooded character in the series, highly intelligent and her father's pride since childhood, fit as a fiddle matching her unrivalled skills in bending and acrobatics has been presented as a chubby, hysterical and uncertain little girl envious of her brother.","rating":"4\/10","date":"1 March 2024"}
{"title":"As a fan of the OG cartoon - this is a brilliant adaptation!","review":"I have literally created an IMDB account to vote this live action adaptation up, as I'm afraid that some fans of the original cartoon are getting totally blinded by their desire for this to be an exact remake and letting that get in the way of what is a fantastic adaptation - and I say this as someone who ADORES the animated series.Can some of you OG fans please get real, and stop nitpicking and being unfair to a series that has clearly been made with a huge amount of respect for the cartoon, and also delivers in SO many aspects.One thing to make immediately clear is, you are NEVER going to get the same level of goofiness\/soul as the original cartoon. The Netflix series has of course had to approach it with some different angles, because why on earth would they try and exactly copy\/remake what is already basically perfect in the animated version?In this adaptation, there is a quirky\/humorous side to each episode which is so enjoyable but also blends super well with the slightly more mature aspects of the fights and the brutality of the fire nation which isn't observed in the animated series.I think the tone of the script\/dialogue is honestly very true to the original as well, despite having the jokes toned down. Sokka's actor in particular does a great job keeping things lighter and jokey, akin to his cartoon self - but in the live action he doesn't overdo it, which is the right decision! Theatrical dialogue and delivery obviously worked so well in the OG cartoon, but would be super obvious\/cringe in a live action. I honestly think the balance is just right, and chatting to my brothers who also grew up watching the cartoon with me, and other family and friends it is clear that loads of people think this too - unfortunately on the internet at the moment it feels like the nitpicking moaners are louder, which is why I'm coming in to bat for this adaptation!This series has added a level of maturity, particularly to the fight scenes, and the visual effects are stunning and a joy to watch. The action and fights feel more intense, the bending is breathtaking to see in live action, and the choreography is clearly well thought out and flows fantastically. The locations\/scenery is all stunning as well, and makes my inner child so happy to see it!Also to add, the actors in this do a great job. Again, they aren't carbon copies of their cartoon versions (nor should they be!!) but they capture the key and most important aspects of their characters spirits\/personalities so they feel familiar. Azula, Mei, Tai Lee, Uncle Iroh, and Zuko are all good examples of this. Aang crucially has his cheekiness, his childish innocence and bright\/sunny disposition, Katara is strong-willed, responsible and sometimes short-tempered, and Sokka is sarcastic, jokey and witty, but also serious when he needs to be!Seeing the scenes I watched as a child come to life in this adaptation has been so brilliant, and I cannot wait to see what they do for the next season and so on - if people seriously want to try and tank what is a great adaptation's chances at a second, third and fourth season, I honestly think you aren't real fans, as you are too attached to the exact retelling of the cartoon to the point that you are ruining the chances of this great new series to be able to tell more of this amazing story, and ruining the enjoyment for the rest of us who are happy with the new retelling - but don't half bang on about it like the nitpickers do.To sum up, fantastic show, keep up the good work and I can't wait to see more!! Bring on Season 2-4!","rating":"10\/10","date":"24 February 2024"}
{"title":"Amazing ATLA Live Adaptation","review":"As a child, sitting cross-legged on the floor, I was captivated by the original Avatar: The Last Airbender series, dreaming of a day it would be brought to life in a live-action format. After enduring a disappointing film adaptation that is best left unmentioned, Albert Kim and his team have finally fulfilled that childhood wish.This adaptation is nothing short of spectacular, meriting not only a second but a third season to bring its story full circle. The bending effects are a particular highlight, with earth bending stealing the show as my personal favorite. The cinematography, character development, and world-building are all executed with such finesse that they take your breath away.While the series diverges from the original in certain aspects, it introduces its own twists and turns that keep viewers on the edge of their seats. Although I occasionally found myself questioning the omission of certain scenes, I realized that these changes added to the suspense, making the narrative unpredictable and thrilling.The showcasing of backstories for Zuko and the Airbenders were particularly compelling, offering deeper insights into their motivations and enriching the tapestry of the show. This fresh perspective helps to understand the complexities of Zuko and Aang as characters.In summary, this show is a remarkable achievement. I encourage viewers to approach it with an open mind. I am confident that those who do will find themselves as enchanted as I was.","rating":"8\/10","date":"23 February 2024"}

Maybe their personalities are a little to good compare whit the original story but this is make them more humble.There are moments where I forget is a movie.I am a girl but I noticed that the yang girls are a little bit different, but the boys are really alike whit the boys from the animations.I hope the next season is due soon! \uf8ff\u00fc\u00a7\u00fb","rating":"10\/10","date":"28 February 2024"}
{"title":"great effects, everything else sucked","review":"Im going to keep this short and simplethe effects are great!The story is horrible\nthe characters are flat and bland\nits incredibly rushed\nthe story line makes no sense???(for example, in the og, the fire nation defeats the air nomads without anything special, but in the live action its said that they \"have the power of the comet\" to defeat the air nomads?? Which makes the entire storyline confusing because the comet only comes around every 1000 years, while aang was only asleep for 100.)so yeah\ni hate it\nbut the effects are great\njust nothing elsesure, you might like it if you havent seen the original\nbut it will make no senseof course im going to be a bit biased because ive seen the animated series many many times, but even if i hadnt, irs still blandthe casting is okay\nand im sorry but there is NOTHING redeemable about sokka.He has no humor,\nno development,\nhis interactions are awkward and short,\nhis actor looks more like lil huddy than sokka???Zuko did a great job though!Watch it, don't watch it, just keep in mind that the story is rushed and will.make little to no sense.","rating":"3\/10","date":"28 February 2024"}
{"title":"A Visual and Narrative Triumph","review":"Netflix's adaptation of Avatar: The Last Airbender stands out as a visual and narrative triumph. The seamless integration of stunning visual effects elevates every element of the story, making it a truly immersive experience. From the breathtaking bending battles to the intricately designed costumes and sets, the production quality is top-notch.Moreover, the screenplay stays faithful to the original series while also expanding upon the rich lore of the Avatar universe. The pacing is expertly crafted, balancing action-packed moments with poignant character development and lighthearted humor. Each actor delivers standout performances, bringing depth and authenticity to their roles. Whether it's Aang's infectious optimism or Zuko's inner turmoil, every character feels genuine and relatable.Overall, Netflix's Avatar is a must-watch for fans and newcomers alike. Its combination of stunning visuals, engaging storytelling, and stellar performances make it a true gem in the world of television.","rating":"8\/10","date":"6 March 2024"}
{"title":"This's already become one of my best shows!!","review":"Amazing storytelling, this might be different from the animation in quite a few ways but it still feels like ATLA, the visuals, the surroundings, the costumes, the worldbuilding, the creature designs and not to mention the phenomenal soundtracks courtesy of Takeshi Furukawa and his amazing team. Sure there were some iffy moments and some scenes to nitpick but not enough to take me out of the story . Don't expect it to be a copy paste of the animated show. Extremely hard to pull off a live action Avatar and they have done about as good as you possibly can. I really hope this show be a big hit so we can see more seasons !","rating":"10\/10","date":"22 February 2024"}
{"title":"AVATAR has returned","review":"A timeless masterpiece. This series does the original series justice. It captures the heart and warmth of the original series. The dynamics between the characters are very well portrayed. It also shows the dark side of the uncle Iron - which by the way is painful to watch. The bending looks flawless thanks to the high budget of 15 million per episode. There is one scene of multiple sky bisons and that scene looks just beyond this world. The best part about this series is the cast. The actor that plays aang captures the energy of Aang. Sokka's actor is good at humor. And they also corrected the Katara arc made it better than the cartoon.","rating":"10\/10","date":"22 February 2024"}
{"title":"Much better than expected!","review":"My hopes were very mixed and I was nervous about the show - but it really succeeded all my expectations! The actors are surprisingly good as well, of course you can see that they are quite young.I loved how they implemented some of the background history and design and storyline is just beautiful! This version is more grown up and serious, and I really like that.The bending is beautifully made as well! I loved the fighting scenes and seemed quite realistic, of course there are some moments where it is quite clear that it is cgi, but overall this is an amazing show and I'm really excited for the next!","rating":"10\/10","date":"22 February 2024"}
{"title":"Excellent Visual But No Emotion Whatsoever","review":"I felt nothing watching this show. This show missing its core element and that is its character's depth. The original show is famous for character development arcs like Sokka in Kyoshi Island for example. They changed so much story and it looks all over the place.On the other hand One Piece live-action is successful because though they changed some stories, they were able to draw out their character's depth. By doing so they became the first successful anime live adaptation show.The positive about this show is its visual and bending sequence. It looks pretty cool in live-action. I'm glad they used soundtracks from the original show.So overall this show is below average and I hope they correct those mistakes if they make 2nd season. I hope they make an enjoyable 2nd season.","rating":"5\/10","date":"23 February 2024"}
{"title":"I never put down reviews.","review":"There are so many bad reviews it just brakes my heart. From episode one the series brought tears to my eyes. The series gave us Sokka's humor and the responsable Katara. I do miss some of the enthusiasm, happy spirit vibe from Aang and the make-up from King Bumi and also some other characters looks a bit weird. Other then that it was so good! I laughed so much with cabbage seller. The new and old story's they put together fit very well and it wasn't literally copy paste. That isn't always necessary. I saw great acting work from Ken Leung! Well done! It's fun! Looking forward to the next season.","rating":"10\/10","date":"22 February 2024"}
{"title":"Get over it you're not 10-12 Anymore","review":"People need to grow up with the bad reviews. I Appreciate that we are getting something very close to the show. I like to think this is the movie version(live action) of the book(animated show) Like a book, it is slow, doesn't waste anything and builds overtime. Season 1 ratings show this.The book is better...no one has ever said otherwise. This show is the movie. It's faster, jumbled together and tells a slightly different story. I think it's great they can be older and show a darker side to the show. Grow up, you're not 12 anymore...nothing is going to make you feel that way. Enjoy growing with the world that was built.Also let's be very real about what is happening. The real fans of the show want a 1-1 remake. They loved everything about the show. If they make that people will say it's nothing new and nit-pick everything. It has to be different. They are not going to do all adventures because they are trying to bring in a new audience. Mix all that in with how much it would cost to do all that CGI for those fans to not like it.","rating":"10\/10","date":"23 February 2024"}
{"title":"Brought me back to my child hood","review":"Was truly blown away by this adaptation, after the movie I had very little of an expectation coming into this. But now on my second watch through in 24 hours of release I can say how blown away I am, the casting is almost perfect in my eyes, the actors have done such an incredible job with the roles and bring the anime to life. The CGI has me really impressed and I'm really enjoying how close they have stuck with the original story. I'm hoping they continue with the series and I'm fully looking forward to hopefully what they do with season 2 and 3. I have a feeling this series has the ability to be epic.","rating":"10\/10","date":"23 February 2024"}
{"title":"Remakes can't win...","review":"I haven't seen the original in years, so it feels like I am watching a new show with fresh eyes. Although there are some similarities with the original that I remember, the majority of them feel new to me, which is probably why I have been enjoying this show more than others. However, if you keep going into every episode of this show with the original in mind, then there is no use for you to even watch this as you'll most definitely find yourself being disappointed.I get infuriated when I read some of the reviews where people are saying, \"This doesn't have 'magic' that made the original so great\", as if this isn't a remake. It's a pretentious statement, and it's silly to think that we can make a live-action replica of cartoon characters with the exact same personalities, motivations, quirks, and physical attributes as the original. Even when the actors are doing their absolute best to imitate their counterparts, people will still complain saying that they are \"doing too much\", and it's \"cringe\".The problem I have with this show is that the dialogue could be iffy at times, and CGI is noticeable, especially in the finale, although I don't believe it to be a detriment to the story. However, If this adaptation copied frame for frame from the original, people will still critique it solely due to it being a remake. So this show changes things, but it's still bad because it's not 'true to the original'... You really can't win if you're a remake, but I would say this is as good as Book 1 can get, and hopefully, the future seasons will make the improvements.This show stays true to the source material while adding its own stuff to it. It's enjoyable and doesn't differ from the original like how many of the recent adaptations have. I would argue that this is closer to 'One Piece' when it comes to animation to live-action remakes. Fun show, highly recommend it.Also, I do want to add that Zuko and Iroh are definitely the standouts. This wouldn't have been as good if it weren't for those characters. I was even surprised that they nailed one of the coolest episodes in the animation here, which is the \"Masks\" episode.","rating":"8\/10","date":"23 February 2024"}
{"title":"The biggest disappointment ever","review":"This show is a mess. They absolutely butchered every single character they all feel so flat. The actors, writing, story, and some of the visuals need soo much improvement it's not even funny. I understand that they can't adapt this show exactly the same but this version has lost all the soul of the original. The only thing going for it is some of the fight scenes that are done very well.Btw the actress who plays katara might be one of the worse actors I've ever seen. 0 emotion I would be able to act better.The only good scenes are the ones that are a copy straight out of the cartoon.Don't waste ur time with this. As usual Netflix destroys a beloved show just for some revenue.","rating":"2\/10","date":"27 February 2024"}
{"title":"Awesome adaptation of a great cartoon","review":"Really liked the casting in this live action version of the original cartoon. The story was like for like and the visual effects have been really impressive. I have watched the original cartoon so many times I can't count and this has been a really good take on it. The costumes were amazing the makeup has been amazing and the acting and choreography has been second to none. I am really excited to see what the next season will bring and I hope they keep on improving but also staying true to the original storyline. I can see a few of the reviews are 5-7\/10 but I can only put that down to people binge watching and not watching scene for scene. I give this 10\/10.","rating":"10\/10","date":"27 February 2024"}
{"title":"Messages in this are on point for kids growing up in this current world","review":"The series is engaging. (Point of reference - I have watched the animated series before.) I have never rated a series on here before, but felt compelled to support this one in the hopes it will be renewed so I can enjoy the future portrayal of the journey. The scope of this story is fantastic and will likely get better with support. I only wish there were more episodes to tell the story even fuller. Also, the messages are pretty on point right now - in light of what the world situation is. There is wisdom here that will hopefully resonate with older kids watching it. This has the chance to connect with a new generation of potential fans,","rating":"9\/10","date":"24 February 2024"}
{"title":"A surprisingly accurate adaptation.","review":"I'm sick of adaptations of cartoons, anime, and comics that \"reinterpret\" the source material and change things like adding new characters to put their own spin on it and in the process lose what made people love the original.The creators of this show have NOT done that.They've made a faithful adaptation that is following the story accurately and even including details like the cabbage guy and Iroh's jasmine tea.Its very good in my opinion.I'm disappointed in the loud minority that are complaining about it when this is probably the best adaptation we could hope for and has avoided so many pitfalls.I'd love to see what they all thought of the previous adaptation!","rating":"9\/10","date":"10 March 2024"}
{"title":"Darker tone hut so good","review":"The live action ATLA is a bit less goofy and light hearted, but given the dark subject matters at hand it makes sense. The actors are all really talented, in the pilot the actress playing Katars is a little stiff, but in episode 2 she's much better, it may have taken time to find the character for her. The actors playing Zuko and Uncle Iroh steal the show for me, I'd watch just them for days. Each actor seems to really understand the characters created in the original, even if they're all a bit more serious in this they still feel similarly. The bending is pretty cool to see, and the animals have a realistic but fantastical presence.","rating":"9\/10","date":"24 February 2024"}
{"title":"Same characters, sadly different characteristics. What have yo done to Aang!!","review":"I'm big fan of the main franchise, but this is different. I don't mean the plot i am ok with plot, but the characters themselves are different. Aang in the main franchise was courage, funny, and powerfull. I mean he was the best airbender of his generation. In the live adaptation he lacks the skills. How can he lose fist fight to zuko (no bending) i mean that one advantage of airnomads is feeling their environment and being flexible to avoid enemy's attacks. Also how in a whole season he doesn't waterbend!! He was always trying new things and with skill, buth this Aang is different at all. To give a credit every other thing was good or very good too. But Aang was sadly wasn't.","rating":"5\/10","date":"23 February 2024"}
{"title":"Perfect blend of old and new","review":"This is indeed, in many ways, a pleasant surprise. I am one of the few people who can, atleast somewhat, find some joy in the 2010 adaptation - but this one, for sure, attempted to do a more faithful and conventional adaptation, paying homage to the original series.And whilst it looked good in the trailers, I must indeed claim to be rather pleasantly surprised. This series feels very carefully crafted, very much in tune with the original, whilst keeping it a bit more mature and less cartoonish.The actors all do an incredible job, and feels very much in line with their animated counterparts, whilst bringing some of their own style to the performances. It feels very authentic, very real and all the complexities and great character works from the original indeed feels ever present.The effects, action scenes and cinematography - all incredible, a far cry from the 2010 version, and looks all around greatly adapted.Overall, is it as good as the original? No, I would definitely not say that, and that was not what I expected. But for what it is, I am very happy with it, and for sure hope it is renewed for more seasons. Great love letter for fans of the original show!","rating":"9\/10","date":"1 March 2024"}
{"title":"Can't wait for another season!!","review":"I love love it! I was super excited and was not let down by Netflix. First of all, just look at the intro. Oh so nostalgic! They changed things but I mean... I don't just want a copy of the original series. It's nice to see the live action in a different way and there are plenty of similarities. I was really scared because of the live action movie years ago which was terrible but I was relieved when I saw this live action series. Like the casting and the CGI! Acting could be better to be honest but is okay. The last episode had me in tears and I must say the actors really grow on you.I will be waiting for the next season.","rating":"9\/10","date":"24 February 2024"}

I'm 31 years old and watching this brings soo many memories, my request watch whole series is ne then try to read reviews.After all i know there is so many changes and some you will find unnecessary but they try to make it refreshed.

{"title":"The award goes to Zuko","review":"As someone who grew up with Avatar, my excitement was immense and at the same time, my expectations were high. Initially, they were even too high. I struggled to like the series in the beginning because I was too attached to the cartoon and missed many things that I had grown to love there. Nevertheless, I tried to change my perspective to see it as an independent work from the cartoon. Aspects that distinguish live-action from a cartoon. Costumes, CGI, props, acting skills, bending styles, etc. It's important to remain realistic and dispel the notion of a 1 to 1 copy. While some creative processes or dialogues may be flat and patchy, overall it's a beautiful presentation of a possible Avatar world.My special focus lies on Zuko (Dallas Liu). You could not only hear but also feel his anger, his rage, his disappointment. His emotions were clearly evident, and he played a significant role in the series for me. He kind of carried it. I missed this acting skills from a few, but still it's nothing I take for granted so I see a potential in everyone to grow from there.Overall, I am still grateful to have the opportunity to see Avatar as a live-action adaptation. Detached from a copycat expectation.","rating":"10\/10","date":"28 February 2024"}
{"title":"If I could rate lower I would","review":"So there's a lot to go over so... I took some notes while watching and saved them. The continuity is completely broken but here are some of my notes. Wan Shi Tong (knowledge owl) is for book 2 \"The Library\". 1. Sokka and Katara do understand it. They go there with Zei (an archeologist in the desert outside of Ba Sing Sa). That is where they find out about the solar eclipse and prepare for \"the day of black sun\" (aka the darkest day in fire nation history). Wan Shi Tong is not in the spirit realm. The talking fox 1. Doesn't talk, 2. Collects books for the library. No firenation forces are trying to overthrow Ozai, theyve had 5-6 generations of brainwashing. Would never happen. At the beginning of ep 5 the people in the bar said the avatar was with waterbenders from \"pirates\" and they killed the giant monsters in the canyon (ep: the great divide, which introduces us to 2 tribes with very different lifestyles and Aang learns to be a mediator which is imperative to the storyline. He never spoke with Kyoshi on Kyoshi Island, the only time he does is in book 2 when he transforms into her during a sentancing for Kyoshi killing Chin the Conqueror in the process when she seperated Kyoshi Island from the mainland (he stood on a crumbling cliff so he kinda killed himself). So the avatar CAN turn into a previous avatar outside of a shrine, thats bs and would just allow Aang to go to Rokus shrine and end the war now in book 1, ending the series before anything happens at the north pole. MASSIVE continuity issue there. Katara does not cross into the spirit realm ever. This is a big oversight. Where is Haru and his father? They are big players in the day of black sun seige, and Harus dad agrees to go back to prison along with Hakoda (Sokka and Kataras father). Anyone want to explain how June and her pet tracking shirshu got onto an ISLAND (real name: Crescent Island)? That thing runs fast on land, Rokus shrine is on a Island. June could never get to him there, and Roku helps him escape from the sages, not June. They seriously went over Lu Ten before showing why Zuko was banished? Lu Tens story isn't told until book 2 \"Tales of Ba Sing Se\". You dont play \"leaves from the vine\" instrumental as BGM, thats blasphemy. Kataras mother was not killed by firebenders at the south pole, she was captured, alongside Hama (first bloodbender, not introduced until book 3). Anything that shows any emotion to Ko \"the face stealer\". Sokka, Katara, and Aang all show emotion on their face, by lore NONE of them would have a face now. Also, Ko doesn't cause illusions. No one knew about the \"tragedy at the north pole\" until its already happened. Zhao got into Wan Shi Tongs library and learned about the moon spirit (explained in book 2). They were on their way to the north pole to find a waterbending master (women are not allowed to be waterbenders obviously, they are healers. The only reason Katara gets to train is because gran gran was supposed to marry Pakku [he noticed by Kataras necklace, which Zuko used that amulet to track the avatar with June (bounty hunter), explaining that Sokka and Kataras family ancestors are from the northern water tribe). There is no shrine for avatar Kuruk in the north pole. Badgermoles aren't dangerous, they are harmless creatures. The crystals DO show the way through the tunnels (and the hippies go too), sokka and the hippies get seperated, they use a badgermole to get out, Katara and Aang use the crystals. \"BONZU Pippinpaddle Opsicopolis the 3rd\" is the alias Aang used to enter Omashu, not a name Sokka came up with. Bumi did not say who he was, he had Aang do trials while Sokka and Katara were trapped in ice crystals (the crystals slowly grow). At the last test, Aang is offered who to fight (2 massive guys), and he points to Bumi and says him. The \"last challenge\" when they go down the slide is Aangs idea, not Bumis. Jeong Jeong was Aangs first firebending instructor, he refused at first but after being told by Roku to do so he does. Aang burns Kataras hands which causes him to fear fire (just as Appa is afraid of tight spaces and doesnt go into the tunnels under omashu, but forget Appas story even though its what leads into the Dai Li being overthrown at the end of book 2 by Azula, that doesn't matter at all, it's only the point where Zuko and Azula attack Iroh and Aang and cause a permanent Chi block so Aang cant enter the avatar state until the very last battle, not important to the story at all. There is NO setup for the order of the white lotus, which are the great defenders of Ba Sing Se during Sozins comets return. Ba Sing Se will stay under fire nation control with Azula and the Di Li now without the order being established in the series, Sokka wont find a swordsmaster, and the fire nation wins the war due to this oversight. Before getting to the north pole, Aang does lesrn to waterbend and tries to firebend. They also have no idea the North pole being under attack until after Katara masters waterbending. She is also the only female to fight at the battle at the northern water tribe. The \"ice moon\" isn't a thing. Ozai would NEVER compliment Zuko, and Azula isn't inteoducer until AFTER the north pole, let alone Ozai complimenting Zuko for being resilient, and condemning Azula for being coy. That's literally the opposite of his character. You can't come back from that. Zhao kills the moon spirit with fire, not a knife. Zhao learned about the moon spirit from the great library (Wan Shi Tong spirit). Yue is not a waterbender, and she can't visit the spirit world. The moon spirit is a fish, nothing to do with foxes. Zuko speaks out of turn, which causes his banishment, Ozai never asks for his input. It was the disrespect of speaking out of turn, not Zukos care for troops and criticizing the plan that got him banished. He was banished for TALKING out of line, not saying it's a bad plan. Zuko also does NOT fight back against his father at all, and the burn is from a blast from Ozai, not a searing it. Katara is not a \"self-taught master\", her and Aang learn from Pakku. She also never displays the \"octopus stance\" (the most effective defensive stance for waterbending). Aang kills Zhao, not Iroh, Zuko tried to save Zhao. Zuko also never lost his swords, and the dagger Lu Ten gave him he gives to an earth nation child when hes a refugee. The dagger states \"never give up without a fight\" Azulas flames are blue, they burn hotter, Ozai would have banished or executed her for refusing to pick an opponent. Ty lee and Mei are not around Azula until book 2 where Azula burns the net under Ty Lee at the circus and coerces her to join. Mei joins because she's bored. As much as people meme about Zukos \"my honor\", he doesnt say it 1 time in 8 hours of screen time. Its imperitive as he has to learn his honor is to help Aang defeat firelord Ozai, and that his honor is not being a faithful servant to his father. Without that, again, the continuity is broken.Okay so my 4 biggest issues\n1. No Jeong Jeong = no Aang afraid to firebend\n2. No early establishment of the Order of the white lotus\n3. No Aang waterbending\nAnd 4... which you seem to disagree with, Kanna (gran gran) is the entire reason Pakku agrees to train Katara. We're supposed to believe she became a waterbending master with 1 scroll and like 20 minutes of combat? That's a horrible joke. If that's how easyit is to master an element, just have a 2 minutes montage of aang and katara waterbending, rest of s2e1 finding toph, s2e2 toph and aang 5 minute montage, rest of episode exploring until they find Jeong Jeong and he teaches aang to firebend in s2e3, then aang go on a spiritual journey and learn energy bending in s2s4, then beat Ozai in s2e5. Only 5 episodes MAX left if this is precedent. Library can't exist, Wong Shi Tong is in the spirit realm so can't find put about the solar eclipse which means no reason for th3 Di Li, no ba sing se, no appa getting kidnapped, no drive for destiny or honor by zuko so no possible way for him to convince himself to help aang, haru and tyro gone so without them or Library, def can't do an invasion, but no order of the white lotus so either aang beats ozai before they Conqueror ba sing se, or ba sing se stays firenation. Also since aang clearly has no feelings for Katara now, he can't lock his Qi by caring so he just has to learn from guru pathik... but wait no Library anymore so no appa kidnapped and no way him to tie note to appas horn so... yeah continuity is beyond all broken, the first live action was better and that's saying something. Anyone who is defending the live action (either of them), has never actually watched and understood the arcs of each character and how the ending was hinted in book 1 in many instances. Could have left jet out cuz no reason to capture appa and no arc for him, but no order of the white lotus setup so that's just gonna magically happen instead of it being hinted at in book 1... and who's idea was it to make Yue a waterbender? This is a disgrace. I get its a remix, it's not a 1:1 copy, but it has broken the continuity of the storyline so badly that s2 and s3 will have to be completely different, not even resembling the source material in order for the aang to win. Do us all a mercy and just finish it in the next 4-5 episodes, it's already established that you can master bending in 30 minutes (not like Roku who started at 16 and didn't finish his training until he was 28... definitely doesn't take 12 years), nope 30 minutes to master an element is all you need. Either do the mercy and put this show down like a lame racehorse or remove it from the internet.","rating":"1\/10","date":"11 March 2024"}
{"title":"Ignore the haters and try it for yourself....","review":"I'm honestly wondering if I was watching the same show as most of the negative reviewers. For example, a frequent hater comment is that the series lacks humor yet I found myself giggling from the very first episode - and believe me, my family and friends will be quick to tell you that's highly unusual. I found the characters and story well done - not perfect, of course, but still well done. Another complaint I don't understand is that the acting is flat and lacks emotion - admittedly, some of the cast are better at it than others, but, the emotions still come through. There are even complaints about the score not being the one used for the anime - not in its entirety, no, but the echoes are there. The point of a score is to emphasize and accent the emotions a scene is meant to evoke, and this one definitely accomplishes that - especially in moments such as the flashback scene between Zuko and Iroh in episode 4.I understand, even if I may not always love, the creative choices that had to be made in terms of scenes and characterizations. But the critical point for me is that even with the changes, it still evokes the spirit and emotions of the original anime and that makes it worth watching and recommending.","rating":"9\/10","date":"13 March 2024"}
{"title":"100% Beyond my expectations!","review":"I have fond memories of watching the animated series as a child, so seeing it brought to life with such amazing FX in the live-action version is truly impressive! The entire cast did an outstanding job portraying their characters. While I understand that perfection is elusive, I thoroughly enjoyed the show.I'm thrilled with the changes they made in the show, as they added spice and kept things fresh. Rather than simply adapting the original series scene by scene, which could make everything feel bland since I already know what happens next, these alterations bring new excitement and anticipation.I'm hopeful that they allocate more budget for Season 2 and 3, as I love everything about this production! Huge kudos to the casts and crew who worked tirelessly to bring this piece of art to fruition.","rating":"10\/10","date":"29 February 2024"}
{"title":"Much better than I expected","review":"The live action is surprisingly quite faithful to its original material, and the show looks beautiful. The CGI is great, the episodes are jam-packed and fast paced, and the acting is good considering that the actors are quite young. My only issue is with the characterization since there is zero character development compared to what happens in season 1 of the animated show. Katara's anger at not being as good as Aang at waterbending? Sokka maturing to not be a misogynist? Aang accepting that he is the Avatar and learning how to waterbend? I hope the writers can do a better job with this aspect of the show. I think the cast are personality-wise a lot like their characters so it was disappointing that this didn't translate well in the live action. Overall, I highly recommend this show. I binge-watched it in one sitting and thoroughly enjoyed it.","rating":"9\/10","date":"13 March 2024"}
{"title":"It was what it had to be","review":"The reason why most people are disappointed with the series, is because they had unrealistic expectations, firstly there is always a problem with adapting animations or anime even, heck i can go on and list a lot of them, but one of the most prominent problem is a reference point, because most people have a reference they seem to go into the new project with the intent to spot any difference from the source material , they see the adaptation for what it could be and not what it is, what i see is a, forgive me for saying this but a \"realistic take\" on ATLA, they did somethings wrong but they also got a lot of things right, like emphasizing the weight on this kids shoulders, kids his age should be playing but here he is carrying the knowledge that the whole world is under his care, the discovery that he'll have to be on his own, cause even his past selves can't help him, the guilt he feels for abandoning his people, the feeling of in adequacy , fearing his own ability, and basically a child that doesn't want to grow up, but has no choice but to do just that, while keeping his innocence and child like optimism, this adaptation focuses on emotional impact , putting aang in a position where he has to deal with these things.I also liked how it portrayed every member of team avatar as geniuses, aang with airbending, sokka with martial art, battle strategies and engineering, and katara with waterbending, to some it looks like the writers just handed this qualities to them, but i see it a different way, not making them a genius by birth, but geniuses by necessity, the adaptation added a little more depth to zuko's character, making him have a certain bond with his crew, portraying him as a kind hearted soul broken by his family and of the worlds expectation of him, just like in the animation, its easy to see the differences between the animation and adaptation but not so when it comes to the similarities, what i'm saying is the series was exactly what it had to be, any more, and we will be just watching the same thing but with people.","rating":"9\/10","date":"26 February 2024"}
{"title":"I really tried","review":"I'm not quite sure if I at first should apologize. The original series is one of my all time favorites concerning animation series, what means it is hard for me not to be without bias.Putting this aside I really tried to be open minded watching this series, but: I DON'T LIKE IT.First, as many others said, it completely lacks of humor. It takes itself much to serious but still wants to be as close to the original as possible. IMHO this alone is one of the biggest problems.Secondly the writing is very poor. Why would you change a successful story arc? Why give away every detail, that's meant to be revealed during the plot, in the first episode? Ok, when you know the original, you know what will come, but if anybody really likes this series, it's someone who does not know the original.Seriously: watch the original. It's still absolutely great and available in High Definition. It has more heart und is way more funny.And to Netflix, Disney and Co.: are you that much out of ideas? Stop touching timeless classics!","rating":"4\/10","date":"23 February 2024"}

{"title":"Overall, a great adaptation","review":"While the adaptation isn't perfect (and no adaptation ever will be), it's an absolute joy to watch. The effects are great, the bending is extremely well done. The sets are beautiful and detailed. Overall, the acting is strong with just a few weaker performances. Actors for Zuko and Sokka are standouts by far.What the show does especially well is fleshing out the backstory to the characters. Seeing more of Zuko's backstory especially is really powerful. Dallas Liu is incredible and brings so much heart to Zuko.The weak links are in some of the dialogue, but this is slightly forgivable in some places - the creators are trying to make the show appeal to adults and younger people, to original fans and new watchers. It's a hard balance to strike between exposition and letting it unfold on its own.Overall, a beautiful show with a lot of heart that captures the original world of ATLA very well.","rating":"9\/10","date":"24 February 2024"}
{"title":"Don't listen to all the hate","review":"There was no way there would've been a one to one adaptation of the original, but compared to the last movie- this has been a huge improvement. The cast can improve a little on the acting side, but the effects are stunning. It's been a while since I've watched the actual show, so I'm judging this show less on how closely it matches the cartoon and I'm viewing this as its own show.I will review the show on three criteria: script, effects, acting.The script does well enough, but I think it is a little too dumber down. The majority of the audience arm in their 20s and know the plot. It's not necessary to say every thought out loud.Like I said, in the beginning, the effects are beautiful. All the bending is exactly what I imagine it to be. None of the excess karate movements, just simple and get to the point attacks. The environment was also well thought out and accurate to the show.Lastly, the acting. I realize that most of the cast is still young and so I won't judge them so harshly. I do hope that for the next season for acting improves, but for the sake of the first season, it will suffice. The message gets across, especially when Aang goes to the air temple in finds that his home has been destroyed- you can't help but tear up as Aang tears up as well. Prince did a good job as well portraying a frustrated child that wants acceptance from his father.It does get better throughout the episodes as you develop relationships with the characters and understand what they're trying to do, so we just hang on and enjoy!Excited for season two.","rating":"8\/10","date":"22 February 2024"}
{"title":"They had a winning lotto ticket and changed the numbers","review":"Rating: 1.0Writing this review evoked more emotion than watching this destruction of an animated masterwork. Pragmatically this is a 4\/10, but personally it's a solid 1. It doesn't have to be a 1-1 copy but most changes were complete garbage. Way too many to list but: Reversed sibling dynamics: (Azula inferiority arc, Sokka becomes the father figure Katara becomes the insolent child). An accelerated Katara power crawl (Aang told her one thing and she's now a water bending pro), amalgamations of unrelated arcs (ex: Jet in Omashu combined with the Mechanist air temple arc). Kyoshi character destruction (she became a gung-ho \"forget your friends and FIGHT\" character losing all nuance from the novels). Weird Gyatso power of friendship themes (Aang calms himself down at his grave by remembering their friendship not acknowledging his new support system in Sokka and Katara). Roku character destruction: (his first lines are jokes, Roku is supposed stoic, refined, and compassionate). Sokka's no longer sexist removing a core part of his character development. Idiotic plot points: (Aang going to Roku's temple alone to find a MacGuffin to free his friends, Ozai not knowing about Sozin's comet at the start of the series, Yue breaking off her engagement because she talked to Sokka once. Aang not trying to learn water bending, Kyoshi breaking the power system by showing Aang the future, etc. The show violates the fundamentals of storytelling by telling and not showing (characters go on preachy monologues by either explaining their own character traits, or other characters' traits or repeating the themes of the arc). The only good in this thing is that it looks incredible (for the most part), and made great changes such as removing Aang and Katara's romance, characterizing Ozai, showing the agni kai between Zuko and Ozai, showing the genocide, showing death and blood, introducing more previous avatars, making Zhao a more calculating threat, the 41st division addition to display Zuko's compassion, and making the spirit world disturbing. I don't care to see the remaining seasons so this is a review of season 1 only. They literally had a winning lotto ticket and decided to change the numbers. This could've been another masterwork.","rating":"1\/10","date":"13 March 2024"}
{"title":"Not every live adaptation has to be a carbon copy","review":"I really am thoroughly enjoying this remake. I feel like the most important part of the cartoon, which I have seen in it's totality more times than I could ever count, were the underlying messages and hidden meaning behind every episode. Not only the character development but the morals and teachings woven into every single story that contributed to the overall plot. I think the live action really captured this above all else. Obviously we cannot expect a live adaptation to be exactly like the cartoon to a T, where's the fun or fresh perspective in that? We already have the cartoon, you can't replace it. But I feel like this live action series does an incredible job in retelling this story in a more dramatic and deep sense while still maintaining the overall plot and development. I think the actors were cast fairly well and they did the show justice in terms of respecting the cultural significance of every character. Not only is it told in a way that still respects the original storyline, but it also adds a layer of depth to the things that were left to the imagination in the cartoon due to it being geared toward a younger audience. I have always been in complete awe of the story of Avatar the Last Airbender and how it serves as a reminder of how everyone should live their lives, and I'm really happy that this live action still captured that essence. If you are looking for a word for word, scene by scene live action remake of the cartoon, you're out of luck. Just go watch the original. However, if you appreciate the actual story and meaning behind it, I 100% recommend watching this. It really is leaving me with the same feeling I get after watching each episode of the cartoon.","rating":"9\/10","date":"23 February 2024"}
{"title":"A breath of freshness","review":"I was truly excited to watch this series. A fan of the animated version that got to crossover to live action. It was not perfect but truly had a feel of the animated series. The cast was fairly accurate. The acting may have not been perfect but the cast delivered a great depiction of the series. I'm excited to see if they have a season two. I loved watching it. It's been a while since I have binge watched anything and stayed completely to the end. I'm looking forward to watching this series again, but first I'll watch the animated series because there's so much more I wanted to see in the live action and didn't with only 8 episodes.","rating":"10\/10","date":"24 February 2024"}
{"title":"Great first season. Hopeful for more.","review":"Seriously don't understand why people have gigantic expectations for a live adaptation based off a very detailed cartoon. It was amazing, the CGI was 7-8\/10, the cities and islands looked perfect, the costumes are great. Acting is played by young children 12-17, why do they expect Oscar level performances? They did great! We'll see the real them perform if people would give it a chance for season 2 and 3.For an adaptation based off this iconic show holds big weight I get it, but at least it's 100x better than the other adaptation we got earlier on... they are bound to change some elements of the story, you can't fit 15+ episodes into 8, and some how they almost did. I think everyone should look at the brighter side here and realize we got new hope for the story of the last Airbender. I'm very proud of the work they did. Being grateful cost nothing.","rating":"10\/10","date":"24 February 2024"}

I did binge watch it in two days so obviously I liked it and I hope they make another one because I'd like to see the continuing story of this sense. There seems to be none unless you wanna read the comics. So basically, is it worth the watch of course it is especially if you like movies like this and I look forward to seeing the next one and maybe one day they'll make a movie that actually does well so they can continue the movie series as well.","rating":"10\/10","date":"27 February 2024"}
{"title":"Swing and a Miss... My Cabbages!","review":"First off, this is a disheartening review to write. I had such hopes for Netflix after how much I enjoyed One Piece (Live Action) and Cowboy Bebop (LA). As much as I enjoyed the effects and bending there seemed to be as much green screen as Star Wars Ep. 1.Regarding the acting, while some of the cast was spot on, it was dull and choppy. Most importantly there was no comedy or horsing around. A lot of the spirit of ATLA is in the kids just being kids without adult supervision. Granted they have lessons along their journey but they don't have enough antics along their paths of self discovery. This series seemed to make the same mistakes as the LA Movie. All of the characters were sad and gloomy.Effects were great, fight scenes weren't too bad and the Easter eggs were nice. Acting and rushed story have this series falling way short.","rating":"5\/10","date":"24 February 2024"}
{"title":"If you go into it with an open mind you will love it...","review":"The storyline is pretty decent, although there are a lot of changes to some of the characters and some stories were placed in different scenes to connect with others but it actually made sense. The effects and visuals are really great. The casting is great and although some of the acting were a bit out of place and not that the actors aren't good but I feel the emotions and reactions could have been slightly improved or a bit better. Also some of the dialogue were too stretching and I believe the reason was to draw new audience's with no knowledge about the original series for a deeper understanding of the story. But overall good job.","rating":"9\/10","date":"23 February 2024"}

This is truly something special and I am physically incapable of tearing my eyes away from the screen. Every moment is incredible, the acting, costumes, the choreography. The production value is definitely noteworthy. The manner in which the bending is shown certainly displays the fact that there's bending within the universe. I just can't get over the line delivery though and the pure commitment to behaving in a way that displays the nature of the characters. Only thing is the music is nothing to write home about.","rating":"10\/10","date":"25 February 2024"}
{"title":"Cynical People Rating it Lower","review":"First and foremost incredible above and beyond casting on the characters. Acting was incredible and one of the best live action remakes made. People may cry that it doesn't stick to the exact script of the original, but what does?The difference is that this Avatar sticks to the essence of the original while making fresh new turns while paying homage to the original. The majority of old characters in Book 1 make their appearances, albeit in a different order, but they are there. When has a temake ever stuck 100% to the original? Never. This version was done brilliantly.The cinematography, acting, and attention to detail pays off in this show and it's be foolish to miss out on this series.","rating":"10\/10","date":"29 February 2024"}
{"title":"Pretty but soulless","review":"Before I get into things I will say, the vfx in particular for the bending are beautiful but unfortunately this is the only thing bringing it up from 1 star to 2. Even with this, the cgi for the animals is horrifying, making momo look like a Guillermo Del Toro monster rather than the cute lemur he is meant to be and is treated as.As for the story, it is very inconsistent with a great deal of plot holes throughout. It also seems that the team creating the story had no respect whatsoever for the source material as the books, original series and comics are completely disregarded in the show.The casting was also quite a let down. While one or two actors were a good choice (namely Zuko and Ozai in my opinion), many seem be entirely void of personality. The choice of casting a 12 year old character with a 13 year old actor is fair, but his 13 year old love interest with a 17 year old woman makes their interactions feel entirely false.A great deal of the series also seems rushed. While world building is clearly attempted in parts, it is only given minutes at a time and then never mentioned again so as to not allow viewers to understand the world if they don't know the past series or literature.All in all this series has been a huge let down in all departments other than the respect for the bending (though still plot holes by comparison to source content exist with this too). Unfortunately the show is hard to understand if you have no knowledge of past series or comics\/books but is equally hard to forgive if you do due to the teams blatant lack of respect for the history of the world they've tried to portray.","rating":"2\/10","date":"26 February 2024"}

So, with trepidation I started the Netflix adaption and was blown away with the visuals, chemistry of the cast and the soundtrack. There are differences but it expand upon the original. An adaption is never a carbon copy and this series has met the challenge of remaining true to its roots while adding flavour of its own.It's a joyous experience to see this beloved show adapted with care, I'm hoping Netflix continues with the next two volumes in the future.","rating":"8\/10","date":"22 February 2024"}

If I had done something different I would bring in some small things here and there but I really love it it's a great experience.I would recommend to think that it can't be the exact the same and that it need to be different and also that the Bending is good and better than the movie.

The live-action adaptation has many positive aspects, such as impressive effects and scenery.Although it could have benefited from a few more episodes to further develop certain storylines, overall, I found it to be an enjoyable experience.However, if you are expecting an exact replica of the cartoon, you may be disappointed. Approaching it with an open mind will likely lead to a more enjoyable viewing experience.The worst thing about the live action is most definitely a certain wig within the Northern Kingdom.","rating":"8\/10","date":"6 March 2024"}
{"title":"Inspired by the Animation not a reap by reap of the animation","review":"This is a good adaptation - If you are going in expecting to get an exact copy of the animation then you are better off just watching the animation.This adaptation of the animated series takes a different path, aiming for a realistic and somber tone with impressive CGI. While it's fine for adaptations to change things up, the main problem is how Aang, the main character, focuses more on his friends than on being the Avatar when he returns after a century-long absence. It would have been more engaging if he concentrated on training and fulfilling his duty to restore balance to the world.A few characters too were portrayed poorly like Avatar Roku , maybe we would see more of him in season 2 .However , its enjoyable and kept me glued to my screen for the whole weekend.","rating":"8\/10","date":"26 February 2024"}
{"title":"Effects are great, acting and story are bad","review":"I don't understand why people are okay with the acting here. I will let it go for Aang, even though every time he spoke I cringe, because he's a kid. Most of the other actors, Iroh, Zuko, Sokka, Bumi, etc were just trying too hard the whole time. I get that I shouldn't compare it to the cartoon but there were way too many changes that felt forced and unnecessary. The flow of the story and how moral Aang is supposed to be was just so forced and cringeworthy. Aang was laid back for at least some of the cartoon and that was pretty much completely cut out for his character in this version. I am only giving this a 5 because of the visual effects. It will never be as good as the cartoon but it's very obvious that this is a classic Netflix created show, meaning acting was meaningless, story can just be forced on the audience because they felt that everything had to be included in some way, despite a terrible delivery. Visuals were great, acting and story could have been better. Anyone who thinks the acting is good, I question your judgement.","rating":"5\/10","date":"7 March 2024"}
{"title":"The hate is confusing","review":"As a fan of the original series it's hard to not appreciate that this adaption exists. Yes it changes characterizations a bit but overall has the same feel and direction of the original. The cast does a great job portraying these characters and each episode feels important and on track.It's surprising to see some of the negativity surrounding the show, including some that are written by \"fans\" of the animated series bashing it. A fan should want more seasons of this show to exist, not try to bomb it so that doesn't happen. I am just glad that this show exists and brings me back to a story I loved as a kid. Thanks Netflix for giving Avatar another chance to be adapted to live action, it deserved it.","rating":"9\/10","date":"24 February 2024"}
{"title":"what?","review":"I don't understand where all of the hate is coming from.I loved that they actually explained what the Avatar State is, instead of just \"blue glowing plot armor blasts the enemies.\"And I loved that Zuko is actually almost a decent human being. It makes the total 180 that he does into being a good guy more believable, instead of coming from out of the blue.I love that Sokka isn't a sexist pig anymore. People cry because he doesn't have room for growth now, as if being a sexist scumbag was his entire point. If a character only exists to grow from sexist to not sexist, then their pointless asses need to be written out of the show.","rating":"10\/10","date":"29 February 2024"}
{"title":"But the emotional damage is over 9000","review":"This is one of the best live action adaptations. Exactly what every adaptation should be - it respected the source material and elevated it. It took an emotionally mature children's cartoon and made it an epic fantasy live action series. They told the same story but in a whole new way, (though some lines and shots are directly lifted from the cartoon) weaving familiar storylines and embellishing the characters motivations. Every. Single. Actor. Knocked it out of the park! By working closely with the original creators, the director beautifully captured the epic scale and ran with it. Superior modern day effects, skilled actors and masterful writers are what separate this from the earlier live action movie we fans do not speak of. While certain characters were made more likable by the additions, the only flaw I hold against the movie is the lack of focus on hard work and dedication. There was a little struggle for our protagonists in the earlier half of the season, but by the time we arrived at the finale it didn't feel as earned as it did in the cartoon. There was more reliance on an inner strength, which was executed well, but at the expense of all the hard work the original Aang put in. Perhaps they could have spent one more episode on practicing their waterbending before the big finale. Regardless, this series had me on the edge of my seat laughing and crying my eyes out both with happiness and sadness. I thoroughly enjoyed the roller coaster of emotions this put me on. After watching all of it, this was not made with children in mind. This was designed to rip the hearts out of the fans of the source material while also giving us exactly what we wanted.","rating":"9\/10","date":"6 March 2024"}

Og anime series was a remarkable one, the thing is we all have to understand that how its hard make a live action from the anime. 2010 s movies of avata is actually trash according to me, but its some characters were well accurate. I think netflix took that risk and they did a great job by remaking this one. Honestly i loved this completely compare to the movie. Im expecting netflix can continue this project for upcoming season 2 and 3, and i think they already planned and done it coz those actors are shiftly grown now, otherwise it can directly affect to the succession of this series, specially for the Aang's character.

I've never found American accents quite so grating. And I hate saying that. I know it's not real but even so it doesn't feel authentic.I will persevere just in case it gets better but I suspect it won't.So disappointing as there is so much scope within the original story for action, effects, character building and a bit of moral teaching.I watched the animated series on kids to even though I was an adult.

Overall, I enjoyed and appreciated it, 7.5\/10 (rounded up for the sake of whole numbers)\uf8ff\u00fc\u00eb\u00e7\uf8ff\u00fc\u00e8\u03a9Liked:-intro scene of the attack on the air temples! It really made it feel real, in that it was happening right then, and the transition from aang being there to when he emerged 100 years later was quite nice, as I really felt like I wasn't looking at a flashback but from his POV of those events taking place not too long before meeting Sokka and Katara, could be just me though.-Zuko's actor! At first I was iffy, but watching him throughout he really nailed the angsty teen moments, and I really liked seeing the mirroring of before he was banished, as a happier kid to have a hardened heart. Portrayed well imo.-bending! Definitely not slow like the movie that doesn't exist, and avatar kyoshi's bending scene I was in complete awe.-honorable pro mentions: kyoshi warriors' wardrobe and makeup were beautiful, all flashbacks were well played out esp. Zukos agni kai, June and Nyla were perfect, escape from fire nation prison w blue spirit, Zhao is an annoying punk(as he should be) & Lt. Jee is a good actorDisliked\/didn't care for:-the almost complete erasure of Sokka's sexism. I had heard how they took the aspect away before the show was released, and it was just as I had worriedly thought: key moments to me were lost. When Aang was released from the ice it wasn't because of Katara's anger toward Sokka dismissing girls. That and the fact that they didn't even include Sokka's \"where are the men who attacked us\" or \"bunch of girls\" remarks against the Kyoshi Warriors before straightening up and gaining that respect was quite a miss for me.-interaction with Bumi. It would've been nice to see Aang play through Bumi's trials to figure out that he's his childhood friend, and instead of Bumi being completely playful, he seemed hateful\/bitter towards Aang letting the world become what it is now. And we didn't get to see Flopsy \uf8ff\u00fc\u00f2\u00ee-the ending with Aang taking over as a water beast was all sorts of weird\/disappointing to me. It destroyed lots of the land, didn't seem to waterbend anything but smash like a toddler, no push and pull of the fire nation ships. Zhao not getting taken as well into the spirit world but instead burned\/drowned by Zuko and Iroh(?)-honorable con mentions:\nthe gAang not visiting a bunch of different places(Jet, the mechanist, etc only taking place in omashu) , no Bato\/mention of finding their father, not enough playfulness throughout, need more Sokka sarcasm more Katara \"my mother\" more Zuko \"my honor\", no Aang waterbending anything \uf8ff\u00fc\u00f2\u00b5Definitely didn't expect a 1:1 of our beloved cartoon series, but it did miss the mark or completely missed in general some key parts for me. Appreciated and understood some of the merging that needed to be done to get things to fit into 8 episodes, and can respect it as a great watch for those who haven't seen the og animation yet. I'd say they did a great job for sticking as close as they did to the og material, especially as a live action which are known to butcher animations greatly. This was not one of those butchered live actions, such as the movie that does not exist.","rating":"8\/10","date":"24 February 2024"}
{"title":"Whats good and what must be fixed","review":"The writers manged to add the a couple off things the orginal atla didnt have. The fire nation raid's on the airbenders and i love that we got more content in episode 1 off gyatso then in a 3 seasons and 61 episode series we got in the whole atla. Soo dont get me wrong there are flaws in this and the other episode but they have made a good story line and i think we can all agree that if the fix the small problems then we have 2 good seasons to cone. The things that i think are very good is espacily the characters off sokka and sukko. I like aang but something is missing and katara gets too anonymous. Sukko is acted perfectly acted and the story about the 41. Divison is so heartwarming and good and this are somethings that the added now which i think the main show missed out on. So if they can get aang to be the goofy kid with extrem strength and make katara more relevant this could be very good. And sokkas character is very good and i like him and his acting alot but i want him too get too say more off his stupid not funny jokes but you laugh eiter whey jokes. So tho conclude it has its flaws but it has alot off posetivs aswell and we all know it can never top the first show but it can still be extremly goooood.","rating":"8\/10","date":"21 April 2024"}
{"title":"Great show in many ways, strange story change","review":"I agree with most of the other reviews here.This show is awesome, mostly the bending is incredible.Fantastic world design! Animals look real, sometimes to real \uf8ff\u00fc\u00f4\u00e0 The changed storyline is maybe a little difficult to understand.There are some plots I don't understand why they cut them out.. (won't spoiler here)Also I like the duo Iroh and Zuko! The Actors are well picked.As well as Sokka, he do look a like with his cartoon character. By the way, wow how hot is Osai !!In the German version, they picked most of the original cast from the Synchronisation. That's pretty cool!I like the fact that they tell us more about the beginning of becoming the avatar and starting the War.Hope they will do the following books too.Now we're triggered and want more.","rating":"8\/10","date":"23 February 2024"}
{"title":"Good adaptation , cheesy vfx , garbage acting","review":"Adaptation is good thats for sure ,but vfx is very sluggish ,and acting is so cringy that I can't even watch some of the performances\nActing was the biggest turn off for me. AANG character looks good but his performance was not up to the mark. Zuko looks just as menacing as the anime character, and his uncle was pin point accurate, but then those funny nuances which we thoroughly enjoyed in the anime, we missed it here. Aang seems to be much serious which he is not. Katara character us much more fiesty in anime but here she is more serious ,more forgiving and much boring. Her brother is nowhere accurate as anime ,so overall better than knight shyamlan avatar but ,nowhere near the anime avatar.","rating":"2\/10","date":"3 March 2024"}
{"title":"Is Good but not The best","review":"I don't know what fans where expecting like 1 to 1 copy, I have watch 8 times the original animation series and i like that is a different take to avatar the last air bender take, story is for me 7.5\/10 with the idea of mixing story's at omasu beginning very catastrophic it should have at least 2 more episodes and thats -2 to story for me and the acting of some child was bad -0.5 and the total for story is 7.5\/10.Characters like zuko and iroh where the best with there relation and aang reletions with monk and katara,soka where explain very good also i like the idea of ozai showing and make the story good. The effects where perfect for me 10\/10 the bending was so good I want to see more of it very realistic, the citys like omasu or North pole, villages fell real, code of drees was excellent. For me was what i expected because of 8 episodes and less screan time to go to all the places.","rating":"8\/10","date":"24 February 2024"}
{"title":"Bring on Season 2, I want to see Toph!","review":"As a die-hard fan who faithfully tuned in to the show during exam season (which happened six times a year), Avatar has always been my ultimate source of soul healing.Let's start with the positives:\nCABBAGES! They had the best man turning up! He did a terrific job 10\/10.Out of all the character arcs, Zuko's was hands down the best. Whoever was behind it deserves to lead every character's development. I couldn't hold back tears during the heartfelt moments between Iroh and his nephew. The scene where the soldiers welcomed Zuko back as the prince was executed perfectly! And the tribute to Iroh's late son was incredibly touching, especially the instrumental song. Overall the music was spot-on, no complaints.The action sequences and visuals were top-notch! Particularly, the fight scene involving Avatar Kyoshi was seamlessly integrated. I had to pinch myself to remember I was watching Netflix when characters met their demise. I appreciated the narrative flow, and the mix-up with certain characters wasn't half bad; it actually added an intriguing layer. Of course, condensing everything into eight episodes inevitably required some sacrifices.Now onto the not-so-great aspects:\nAzula and Fire Lord Ozai should've been kept under wraps to maintain the tension, as in the comics. Every time they appeared, I couldn't help but think that screen time could've been better utilized for the trio's character development, especially in terms of humor. I missed Aang's youthful innocence; his lengthy monologues covering the same ground became a tad tiresome. Remember the scene where he transformed himself into a snowman and goofed around with Momo instead of focusing on waterbending? Yeah, why didn't he at least learn a bit of waterbending? That was the whole purpose of his journey to the North Pole (in the comics), but I guess there had to be a narrative thread connecting to Kyoshi.I hate to say it, but Katara felt a bit off in the initial episodes. I remembered her as more compassionate and outspoken, always ready to give Sokka a piece of her mind in the comics. What happened there?I initially had doubts about Sokka, but the actor did a commendable job. However, he still falls short in this regard, albeit slightly. I missed his trademark humor and his knack for nicknaming villains. Let's face it, Sokka had some misogynistic tendencies, but his encounter with strong women on the Kyoshi Islands changed him. We definitely need more character development.Overall, I'd rate the adaptation 8\/10. It wasn't bad, but there was room for improvement. Zuko, Iroh, and the fight scenes deserve most of the credit. While the characters were visually stunning, I'm hopeful for more character development in Season 2. I hope Netflix takes the feedback constructively and strives for improvement instead of cancelling shows. I would recommend making more episodes, focus on scenes with just the three of them walking or sitting if it's too costly for the fight scenes. I hate that every show nowadays only has like 5 episodes!Anyway Bring on Season 2, especially Toph! It's disheartening that some people can't find joy in anything and try to tear everything down. Just give this one a chance, please \uf8ff\u00fc\u00f2\u2260","rating":"8\/10","date":"23 February 2024"}
{"title":"\u00ac\u00b4The Avatar Returns\u00ac\u00aa","review":"The series \"Avatar: The Last Airbender\" is an exciting journey into the fantasy world, which successfully combines all the best features of the original animated series and adds new details to create an even more vivid and exciting story.\"Avatar: The Last Airbender\" takes us back to the world of the elements and adventures, where each character has his own unique strength and character. This series fascinates with its beauty and emotionality, combining different genres to create a unique atmosphere that captures from the first minutes and does not let go until the very end.Each episode is filled with interesting events and unexpected plot twists that will not leave anyone indifferent. The series has everything you need for an exciting and entertaining viewing experience: fantasy, action, drama, comedy and adventure.* The series tells the story of Aang, a guy who knows how to control the four elements, who, together with his company, is trying to stop a long war. The plot of the series is full of exciting moments and unexpected twists. One of the series, filled with the spirit of adventure, attracts the viewer with its exciting dynamics and makes him worry about the characters. In general, the series is full of interesting moments that will not let you get bored.* Dialogues in the series are of great importance: they help to show the emotions of the characters and understand their inner world. Their work is very good - they are bright, emotional and memorable.For example, one of these dialogues happens between Aang and his mentor monk Gyatso. In this dialogue, Monk Gyatso explains to Aang that the real power is not physical, but spiritual. This helps to understand that Aang's power manifests itself in his spiritual development.* The idea of this series is very interesting - to connect a fantasy world with human values. Each episode raises important questions about friendship, love, loyalty and other important things. For example, in one episode, Aang and his friends meet Prince Zuko, who can control fire, but cannot control his emotions. This episode makes the viewer think about the importance of emotional control.* The acting in this series is just on top. Gordon Cormier, Kiaventio, Ian Ausley, Dallas Liu and other actors have created vivid and convincing images that will be remembered by the audience for a long time. Each character is worked out to the smallest detail, which makes them even more real and alive. Their game makes the viewer empathize and relive every adventure with them.Gordon Cormier perfectly conveys the emotions of Aang, who strives to save the world, but at the same time feels fear and doubt.Kiaventio in the role of Katara perfectly conveys the strength and determination of his character, as well as his emotional depth.Ian Ausley in the image of Sokka brings humor and lightness to the series, but at the same time shows the serious sides of his character.Dallas Liu as Prince Zuki does an excellent job of portraying a complex and controversial character, demonstrating both his weaknesses and strengths.Paul Lee in the role of Uncle Zuki creates a vivid and memorable image that makes the viewer empathize with his character.Maria Zhang is a wonderful decoration of the series in the image of Suyuki, she conveys her grace and strength, as well as inner conflict.Elizabeth Yu in the role of Azula shows her as a dangerous and ruthless, but at the same time an intelligent and charismatic personality.* The directorial work in this popular series is impressive. Michael Goi, Rosanna Liang, Jabbar Raisani and their team have created a real masterpiece that delights the audience with its beauty and emotionality. Each episode, such as a visit by the heroes of the northern city on a giant flying bison Appa, shows the fantastic world of the series and makes the viewer feel like a part of it. Each scene is filled with magic and mystery, and the talent and skill of the directors elevate Avatar: The Legend of Aang to the title of a true masterpiece in the fantasy genre.The script of the series was written by talented screenwriters who skillfully combined all the best elements of the original, adding new details and colors. The script is filled with a lot of interesting twists and unexpected events that make watching a real adventure. Each episode is masterfully constructed and complements the overall plot, leaving no unnecessary details or hackneyed moments. In one episode, the creators of the series successfully combined intense combat scenes with deep emotional moments.* The camerawork in this series is admirable. Cameramen create cinematic masterpieces full of beauty and emotion. Their landscapes, panoramas and the art of using the camera are particularly noted. For example, the scene of Aang and his friends visiting a temple on a mountaintop captures the viewer with its views. This demonstrates the skill of the operator.* The film's editing, frame composition and special effects are imperfect. The transitions between scenes seem a bit clumsy, the special effects are not impressive in their realism, although they are perceived well in the last episode. Otherwise, the graphics are too noticeable, which prevents you from enjoying the movie. But the acting and the general atmosphere make up for all the shortcomings.* The musical accompaniment in the series is excellent. Takeshi Furukawa's music is easily combined with visual effects, creating a perfect sound that deeply conveys the emotions and atmosphere of the series, adding drama. In the scene where Aang reveals himself and becomes an Avatar, the music and visual effects make up a wonderful episode.* Personal impressions\"Avatar: The Last Airbender\" is an exciting series that fans of the fantasy genre are sure to enjoy. This masterpiece offers a unique blend of adventure, magic and realistic human relationships, which makes it even more fascinating to watch.The series attracts attention from the first minutes and does not let go until the very end. It surprises with unexpected plot twists and keeps you in suspense, turning the viewing into a real adventure.After watching Avatar, you will probably think about many things, such as friendship, love, betrayal and forgiveness. This series evokes a lot of emotions and leaves behind mixed feelings - from delight to reflection on the deep topics it touches on.* OutputI do not hesitate to recommend this series to all fantasy fans. This is a real masterpiece that deserves everyone's attention. I would love to review it again to plunge into this amazing world again, filled with many interesting details and unexpected twists.The series \"Avatar: The Last Airbender\" is an excellent representative of the fantasy genre, which fascinates viewers with its beauty and emotionality. This series is a real masterpiece that deserves the attention of all fantasy fans.

{"title":"It's not EXACTLY like the animation but GREAT anyway.","review":"Pay no attention to the negative reviews and judge it for yourself.It's not exactly like the animated series but it's great nonetheless. I love the way they consolidated some of the animated episodes into a single episode in the live action. Sure, some elements were changed from the original but it's a refreshing change. Seeing the bendings in live action was amazing! Action sequences were exciting. The characters and their struggles were very human. And I say that as a true fan of the animated series.I hope Netflix renews and completes the series! It would be a shame if we don't get to see the rest of the story in live action.","rating":"10\/10","date":"23 February 2024"}
{"title":"...tries to kill the memory of the original","review":"If you love the original, do not watch that show. It doesn't have the depth and transcendence which I loved so much about the original series.The worst is uncle Iro who changes from a Zen-Master and realized warrior into a ridiculous Teddy.If the aim would have been to honor the original, they would have invented a new story with new characters in the same world - like they did with \"legend of korra\". But no, it's the same, just brutal simplified storyline with blunt characters who are a mere shadow of the template. I really don't want the motivation behind that, but it is not aligned with anything Iro would support.Sorry for the rant. It is not \"bod\" as such, they just could have used all those resources to create something of actual value....","rating":"2\/10","date":"3 March 2024"}
{"title":"Did a very good job with this one","review":"I think we call can agree that not many shows or movies come close when it comes to remakes or live action adaptions of originals. This one was well put together. They did a great job with the casting and I'm hoping to see if everyone else agrees as time goes on. Special effects were awesome and they did a good job with the story so far. I'm hoping that people realize that it will be almost impossible to replicate the original show, but so far, Netflix has done good in that regard. I'm not the biggest Netflix fan as of late (that's a topic for another time), but so far, this has the makings of a special series for multiple seasons.","rating":"9\/10","date":"24 February 2024"}

All in all I think most of us long time fans will love it. Yes, there's a few things they can fix for S2 but they are easy fixes honestly. Giving us the humor would be one. The casting was flawless and they did a great job. Give it the chance it deserves as fans. It's not the 2010 film, it's 100x better and any fan of the animated must give it it's due credit.

The Visual effects were amazing obviously. Besides a few times here and there when lines didn't quite hit their mark, the acting was pretty great. Some better than others.I've watched the animated series, and yeah, I guess a few bits were out of order, and some not added at all. But what can you do when a season gets condensed from 20 episodes down to 8, that was always gonna happen.I enjoyed it, and unfortunately I'm already ready for season 2, and I can't wait that long.","rating":"10\/10","date":"24 February 2024"}

I'd advise people to ignore certain critics who are purposefully posting bad reviews for engagement online, including accounts such as 'discussing film' on X. Take them with a grain of salt, watch the show yourself before listening to the negativity. This show is a wonderful adaption and in a league of its own, it has a bright future ahead and I look forward to further seasons. The music is also amazing and really adds to the overall atmosphere, all parties involved should be very proud of the magic they've created.","rating":"10\/10","date":"22 February 2024"}
{"title":"Different characters, same names","review":"Pretty much every character is different from the original. Sometimes not by much, but significant enough.Especially King Bumi. He has a completely different relationship to Aang. Many others simply don't feel fully fleshed out.In addition to this, story parts are mixed up and all over the place. It's understandable why this is the case, but for someone who watched the original dozens of times, it just feels extremely weird and hard to get used to.There are bits that I actually like more than in the original, but they don't overweigh the bad. I started with a completely open mind, but I felt unsatisfied early on.And I know this might come because of financial limitations, but the bending occasionally feels lackluster as well. And I'm not talking about CGI, I don't care if it doesn't look perfect. It's just ... Boring most of the time.","rating":"4\/10","date":"2 March 2024"}

The only thing I would have loved to see zuko reflect more on is the fact he's also fighting for his honor, not just to get back home and be in good terms with his father!Another thing I love is the imitation of zuko, Naa he cooked big time, the voice the rage fighting and that broken little boy we saw in the tv show.I want to see this more, I wanna see them grow, this is amazing!

{"title":"The most wonderful series I have seen","review":"Avatar: The Last Airbender is a live-action series based on the acclaimed animated show of the same name that ran from 2005 to 2008. The series follows the journey of Aang, a young boy who is the reincarnation of the Avatar, a legendary being who can manipulate all four elements: water, earth, fire, and air. Along with his friends Katara, Sokka, and Toph, Aang travels across the world to master the four elements and end the war that the Fire Nation has started against the other nations. On his way, he faces many challenges, such as the relentless Prince Zuko, who is determined to capture him, and the tyrannical Fire Lord Ozai, who wants to rule the world.The live-action version of Avatar is a faithful and respectful adaptation of the original show, with some changes and improvements that enrich the story and the characters. The series is created by Albert Kim, who has done a fantastic job of recreating the diverse and vibrant world of Avatar. The series features amazing visuals, stunning special effects, and spectacular action scenes that showcase the beauty and power of the four elements. The series also has a diverse and talented cast, led by Gordon Cormier as Aang, Dallas Liu as Zuko, Kiawentiio as Katara, and Ian Ousley as Sokka. The actors embody the spirit and personality of their characters, while also adding their own touch and charisma. The series also features some familiar faces, such as Daniel Dae Kim as Fire Lord Ozai, Paul Sun-Hyung Lee as Uncle Iroh, and Elizabeth Yu as Azula.Avatar: The Last Airbender is not only an exciting and entertaining series, but also a meaningful and inspiring one. The series explores themes such as identity, destiny, friendship, family, love, courage, and peace. The series also celebrates the diversity and harmony of different cultures, traditions, and beliefs. The series teaches valuable lessons about compassion, forgiveness, balance, and hope. The series also has a lot of humor, heart, and emotion, that make the viewers laugh, cry, and cheer along with the characters.Avatar: The Last Airbender is one of the best series that I have ever seen in my life. I enjoyed every moment of watching it, and I was impressed by the quality and creativity of the series. The series is a masterpiece of storytelling, art, and entertainment. I am eagerly waiting for the next season, and I hope that the series will continue to deliver the same level of excellence and enjoyment. I highly recommend this series to anyone who loves fantasy, adventure, and drama. Avatar: The Last Airbender is a series that you will never forget, and that will always stay in your heart.","rating":"10\/10","date":"24 February 2024"}
{"title":"Great Adaptation. Cant wait to see all 3 seasons!","review":"I would give a 9.5.You can't expect nor should you want a scene for scene remake of the show and books. The writers were smart to combine the various episodes the way they did. There was also a great tie in\/motivation for Suko which may play out well by season 3. The casting was solid and they did a great job of showing the evil of the fire lord.I can agree with some reviews that there is a lack of humor sometimes but not to the point it should hurt the overall impression. I can also appreciate that some feel there is a lack of \"Aang Arc,\" but I would disagree. The show began with Aangs normal life before being frozen and that was essential to his story. Throughout the show I felt the urgency he had to learn other elements but I would have liked to see attempts to learn water and earth on the way to the North.All in all, this was way better then the movie that we dont need to talk about. Also, Ill be pumped to see the next two seasons and maybe even Korra. I cant wait to see Tough, dragons, lion turtles, innovations with bending and the white lotus. Come to think of it Netflix may need more than 8 epidsodes for each book. The worst thing that could happen is rushing the amazing charecter development and being lazy with the interaction between all charecters big and small.","rating":"10\/10","date":"25 February 2024"}
{"title":"Great first season","review":"I liked the animated series quite a lot - and while I don't recall all the details of it, the live action feels very honest and close to the source, which is great for a change: the source was very well and creatively developed, and retelling it with great visuals is amazing.The original was more of an exciting adventure, and these series takes darker tone, with emphasis on war and suffering and burdens, more like The Legend Of Korra did - and I find it very relatable.It's also great to see an amazing international cast working on this, the casting is impeccable IMO, and most of actors are doing a great job, both lead and secondary (Sokka came as more witty and less goofy than in the animation, but it only makes him more real).There are small caveats here and there - glitches in CGI, overly cliche \"family\" reasonings and some others, but none of that spoils the show.Really hoping for it to continue.","rating":"9\/10","date":"28 February 2024"}
{"title":"A resounding \"meh\"","review":"Some of the visuals are truly spectacular, there are a handful of great fight scenes, and Dallas James Liu stands out for me as Zuko but overall it lacks a lot of the heart, silliness, and subltlely that make the original so great. The dialog is often clunky and over expository. Katara's character is utterly butchered. Aang's motivation for leaving is changed in a way that completely changes how we're supposed to feel about peoole being angry with him for abamdoning the world. And Sokka doesn't learn anything. Unnecessary changes are made without thought as to how they alter character arcs. And Aand doesn't waterbend! Not once! But the biggest miss for me is that it just isn't funny.","rating":"3\/10","date":"12 March 2024"}
{"title":"Anyone complaining about the writing should check their review for spelling errors.","review":"It was a pretty good show, some of the exposition was a little heavy handed though. I don't understand the little changes made to the ocean and moon spirits but it doesn't hurt too bad.The best moments were with the fire nation. If the show had put their focus on Zuko as the primary protagonist I think people could have justified a retelling. Team Avatar was the focus of the original show and if the same story had to be told again a different perspective might've made it feel fresh.All an all I think they did a fantastic job with minor blemishes that could be ironed out in seasons to come, just like the original first season.","rating":"8\/10","date":"24 February 2024"}

The scenes look great, lighting is great, acting is good, I like the characters.I really hope Netflix and Nickelodeon will continue in the same manner and attention to detail and quality for the following seasons.Can't wait for the next season to areive! \uf8ff\u00fc\u00f4\u00e5\uf8ff\u00fc\u00e8\u00aa\nThe characters are great and I love how the actors embody them.

Then I heard some questionable things leading up to the release and I got worried but it's safe to say this show is AMAZING! The special effects are on point and it just feels amazing.

I love the show but I did not expect a frame by frame adaptation but an adaptation that would tell the same story from a different angle. It has delivered are some plot points throw together yes but it makes sense. The main characteristics of the characters are intact are they exactly the same as in the animated show no of cause not that would be a unrealistic expectation every actor brings something new to a role no one can be Sokka, Aang and Katara exactly like originals but as long as the essence of the character is the same it's fine, and in my personal opinion they nailed it there. Adding to that the locations look fantastic and the bending is cool. I have no complaints I am very entertained.","rating":"10\/10","date":"23 February 2024"}
{"title":"Terrible Even When NOT Compared to the Original","review":"You can judge this series one of two ways: comparing it the the original 2005 cartoon or as its own entity. By itself, the story makes no sense, contradictions to the show-don't-tell method which proves this is badly written, poor acting (except for Sokka, Suki, and sometimes Zuko), poor character decision making, laughable hair and makeup, and honestly bad CGI. I'll admit that the costumes are really good. The only things is, is that they made the same mistake most live action adaptations make, which is not dirtying them up. It's odd and out of place seeing crisp clean clothes as if they were just dry cleaned and pressed for soldiers, townspeople, and the main cast. Aang, Sokka, and Katara wear the same clothes the whole series, yet in the finale they look like they just came off the assembly line.*Just a note as of one week after the release: the rating has not changed from 7.4, which leaves me to believe in fowl play.Anyway, as for acting, Katara is not doing it. It's a blank expression for every scene, and this show tends to make her the focus character in nearly every episode. Aang could be good, but with bad writing, he falls flat. How many times do we have to hear him say \"I just like to have fun and play around,\" but we never see that playful side of him. Iroh, all but the funeral scene, comes off as the fat-funny character. Zuko is the embodiment of teen angst, which works pretty well for him but it gets old and one note. Sokka is great, enough said.King Bumi is the biggest offender of bad makeup (along with bad acting). Why put a 30-year-old in extensive makeup and have him act like a stereotypical old man (lip licking, open gate, etc.) when you can hire a jacked 50- or 60-year-old and only put a little makeup on?The prime example for bad writing is when Iroh is captured in Omashu, the guards take him on a transfer to a mining camp or something for POWs. Why in their right mind would they do this?! He's the brother of the emperor of the fire nation. Common warfare dictates that you would use said person as ransom to either get your captured men back or try to make peace deals. He was already in jail (underground with no tunnels to escape from) under Omashu. Also Jhao, who never had any combat experience (he says so himself) is given command of 100+ ships to lay siege to the northern water tribe?!I won't get into comparing it to the original except for the short beats because any more and I would get into a tirade. This is nothing like the original. They cram 2-3 episodes into one and end up making each episode feel like 2 hours. Katara's character: murdered. She went from a firecracker who also caring and motherly to an open-face girl. Plots they did wrong, characters they did wrong, music is even underwhelming. The sets are actually pretty nice though (minus CGI backdrops). All in all, it was honestly a pain to get through this. I've tried to deter people from this on the premise that it's not even fun-bad like Morbius or Loki Season 2.","rating":"2\/10","date":"1 March 2024"}
{"title":"Nicely made","review":"First. Being a gen x, every time they say bender, it means something else. So phrases like 'you have to learn the ways of the bender', and 'to be a bender you must...'. I can't help but figure.So, aside from rusty, it's quite cool, better for younger viewing as everything is childish and clean, pressed, clean clothes, fantastic makeup etc. But a good story and fantasy.The photography is excellent,effects good enough and the acting quite good. Netflix had not gone overboard on the diversity camp and gone for better actors instead, a good move for the series. Shame it's only a 6 part story really.","rating":"9\/10","date":"3 March 2024"}
{"title":"A thoughtfully beautiful homage to animation with originality!","review":"As a huge fan and growing up watching the animated series, I put a lot of expectations on this live action. And let me tell you, I couldn't have been more pleased and my expectations were easily met!! I throughly enjoyed watching this live action. I was compelled to watch it a 2nd time and will be rewatching it the 3rd time. The meticulous attention to detail of the production team in casting, making the sets, visual effects and the A1 BENDING made this series a spectacular delight and tour de force entertaining. The only sad part was it only having 8 episodes. I will fill the void by rewatching Book 2 of the animated version. I can't wait for Season 2!!","rating":"10\/10","date":"28 February 2024"}
{"title":"Amazing pure nostalgia","review":"Love the cartoon series as a child so when I seen the first trailer for the program I knew I would be into it. From watching the first episode it was visually amazing definitely one of the best recreations of a show in live action.I can't think of any issues with program at all they have followed the cartoon too a tee, also the casting for this is spot on every single actor is a perfect representation on the animation. All of the comedy and small little goofy things that are in the cartoon have made there way to the live action series which I thought just wouldn't work out on a live show but they have managed to do it.Definitely hoping for a season 2 on the horizon and then onto 3 and 4.","rating":"9\/10","date":"24 February 2024"}
{"title":"Refreshingly familiar","review":"The first episode felt like a pilot. But starting episode two, the graphics were way better and the acting was a little\nBit more polished. I was surprised to hear a lot of the dialogue was very close to the cartoon's dialogue, it was unexpected but refreshing. And even the actor that played Sokka sounds a lot like the actor from the cartoon. I thought the casting was on point. I liked the actor that plays General Iroh but I think he needs to be a little funnier. He's able to portray the heart warming side of Iroh perfectly though. I've binge watched the cartoons more times than I can count and I watched the movie that came out years ago. I was in agreement with the rest of the viewers that the movie flopped. This show however, did not let me down. I am a huge fan of the cartoon so I definitely had high expectations. I thought the innocence from Aang was present and could see the duality when he would get serious or go on \"Avatar mode\", I thought the actor that played Sokka did a great job lightening up the mood in his true comedic fashion, but I thought maybe he was a bit more of a \"romantic\" than the cartoon. Maybe because this was only 8 episodes long and it felt like the romances were two close together. I really liked Katara. The actress did a great job in the emotional scenes on the last two episodes. I am a happy viewer. I am hoping and looking forward to season two and three.","rating":"9\/10","date":"28 February 2024"}
{"title":"It was... eh...","review":"Let's start off with the good.Episode 6 is a bright spot of the season in an otherwise \"meh\" show. Also the cabbage man. Zuko and Iroh give the most convincing and true to form from the show performances, although, Zuko's fury, anger, and rage are seemingly toned down in this version.Sokka was okay.Aang was fine.That's about it.Now the bad.Katara sucks. Bland, barely any character development, if any, rarely emotion shown, instant waterbending master, no training needed, no need to fight sexism, doesn't really exist in this universe so...Bumi sucks. Doesn't really teach aang any lessons here, is kind of just a mean old man who may or may not be suicidal but just needs aang to kill him instead.Jao sucks. He firebends maybe a couple of times total. Gets completely sidelined because of the inclusion of the fire lord and azula in season 1. What was an excellent 1st villain in the cartoon, who was powerful but overzealous and consumed by his arrogance, becomes a somewhat weak, and insignificant person who happens to be told by a fire sage about the moon and ocean spirits. Why Jao was even selected to lead the charge against the north is beyond me. Apparently a recommendation from azula is all it takes to be promoted to the leader of a whole armada of ships.Roku sucks.Complete goofball.Acting\/Dialogue sucks.It is not just the actors' faults, the dialogue many times feels forced, vanilla, safe, not nearly as smart and sophisticated as the cartoon, which is ironic given the game of thrones comments the creator of the series gave, that being said, the young actors especially need some coaching. Even the adult actors sometimes suck even worse than the child actors. Paku for instance feels less like a powerful, but sexist master, and more like he's somewhat senile. There are many instances of bad acting distracting and taking away from the scene. Just bad.Backgrounds\/effects.Granted, some of the effects are absolutely beautiful, and then there's the rest. Way too many moments where characters are obviously in front of a green screen and either the lighting is off, or the background itself looks fake.The music.Not anything special. Vaguely contains familiar themes from the cartoon, but doesn't have the special feeling of the softer moments and themes like the original that actually make you feel something. Most of the soundtrack is nostalgic but just not as good, so why?Overall, I didn't hate it, but I definitely didn't love it either. There is one episode that I would consider \"good,\" -masks. The rest of the episodes seem like an average attempt at trying to appease the original fans w familiar ideas, but also adding new additions, some of which are extremely stupid, some are fine, most are stupid. There is one very nice addition that I actually quite like, which is that they made Zuko's crew the 41st division, which is the division that he saved when he spoke out of term. I actually like this addition a lot, which I why I gave this a 5, and not a 3. Although, Zuko's blue spirit mask looks like plastic. Lame...Anyway, watch it if you want, don't if you don't, it's whatever. Bye.","rating":"5\/10","date":"2 March 2024"}
{"title":"Solid adaptation","review":"I don't really understand why other people are hating on this... This adaptation captures the heart of the original series. Try watching this not remembering the flow and the shot by shot of the original series it's still loyal to the original. The heart is there, and it gives additional complex layer to the story. The animated one has the childhood fun we all fall in love with. This one is a standalone solid adaptation. Changes are made, yes. But those changes made so much sense. It does not hurt the story and disrespect the original source material.Exoited for season 2. Watch it as it is and never compare to the animation one.","rating":"9\/10","date":"23 February 2024"}
{"title":"Visual are the best","review":"It was great not like the masterpiece of 2005 but the world amazed me and my only problem is the acting and casting. However i believe they can evolve if the series continue. You have to watch it with an open mind there are a lot of people that believe an absolute copy of the cartoon is what they needed but in my mind thats not the case. It is better to watch something different and the work behind the visuals have earned the respect and is a must to understand. I believe the next seasons would fill out my main problem and its due to the acting experience of the young cast that would grow like their age.","rating":"9\/10","date":"24 February 2024"}
{"title":"Wasn't Perfect, But Much Appreciated.","review":"Avatar, the last Airbender live action remake on Netflix did way better than I think anyone was anticipating. They had huge shoes to fill, over the fact that the movie was just so bad. Not everything was perfect. I can say the actors seemed a bit stiff. And they changed a couple things here and there. But for the most part, the story stays the same. Obviously, the animation and CGI looks great. If I were to change anything, it be to have the actors relax a little bit, and try and be the characters there actually supposed to be. Aside from that, I got to say I appreciate how when they would change something early in the show they would compensate with something that wasn't actually in the animated series. An example would be how Avatar Roku was. He was a bit too childish, and not the mostly serious individual we got in the animated series. And then we actually got the Agni Kai between Fire Lord Ozai and Zuko. It was good to see them actually duel a little bit instead of Zuko just getting blasted in the eye. But I digress. Overall, I think they did a very good adaptation to what we were expecting. And I'm hoping we get season two and season three green lit here as soon as we can.","rating":"9\/10","date":"29 February 2024"}
{"title":"Give this series a chance for 2nd season","review":"I watched the original series and i loved it. And now with this new live-action series about Avatar, i want to give a chance to see a 2nd season because of this reasons:1. The 2nd book plot: I really want to see Toph2. The love story between Aang and Katara (for Kataang fans)3. Development of Azula character (i hope they can film content from the Avatar comic too)4. The animated series is Top 7 here, it's a shoe that will be so hard to fit but at least it's better than the movie (sorry m. Night shyamalan)5. I want to see a live-action version of Appa's Lost Days mixed with the library chapter as a non-linear episodeand 6. Because i love Avatar universe and all the performances,.Please i want to see a season 2, and i hope the creators of the original series can join on the production.","rating":"10\/10","date":"29 February 2024"}
{"title":"Really...what a waste of time.","review":"And to think people say M. Night Shyamalan's film was bad, this is just awful, the acting is questionable. I loved the Anime and was really looking forward to see where this would take me, but alas I won't be watching anymore episodes past the first one. I guess I was expecting it to be from Japan or at least have some cultural significance but I just can't accept the accents. The only saving grace for me was Appa the Sky Bison who steals every scene his\/ she's in. Such a pity this was even made but I guess you have to please some people but unfortunately m, I am not one of them. All that said, I'm going to find the Anime and watch that again.","rating":"3\/10","date":"3 March 2024"}
{"title":"EMOTIONAL!!","review":"It is really good. It made me cried few times. Episode 6 got me so emotional and I love it, just like the animated series.What makes this series truly exceptional is its rich storytelling, well-developed characters, and profound themes. Each character, from the playful yet determined Aang to the conflicted Prince Zuko, is carefully crafted with depth and complexity. Their personal growth throughout the series is both inspiring and heartwarming.Moreover, \"Avatar: The Last Airbender\" tackles significant themes such as friendship, loyalty, redemption, and the consequences of war with remarkable maturity. It seamlessly weaves these themes into its narrative, creating a deeply emotional and thought-provoking experience for viewers of all ages.","rating":"10\/10","date":"27 February 2024"}
{"title":"It lacks what made us fall in love with the original","review":"I'm only two episodes in and if my opinion changes I will edit my review, I'll start by saying that adapting a beloved series is always hard and they actually did a pretty good job with the world buildind, the cgi is awesome, the cast was mostly well chosen, but they cut out essential parts of the original series that contributed a lot for character development if you are looking for Sokka a humorous character with some tendency to be a chauvinist that with time and experience outside of his village changes his way of being you won't find him here. If you are looking for Aang a child that only wants to play you won't find him here. If you are looking for Katara you might find her here still didn't figure that one out I'll edit as soon as I've a more conscious opinion. But they took out essential content for character development and made the show way less humorous, and that's okay it's a writing choice a wrong one imo but a choice nonetheless . For me the show it's lacking it's soul and without a soul there's no real future I'm afraid.","rating":"8\/10","date":"23 February 2024"}
{"title":"An Improvement upon the Original?","review":"Hear me out!We all know this show will be a worse show when all is said and done. I would bet a hundred dollars this adaptation will never live up to season two and three of the original ATLA.However, despite season one having excellent world building and characters, it wasn't perfect. It was overly childlike and a bit meandering. My nine year old brother watched the first couple episodes, turned to me, and said \"You know this show is bad, right?\" And I had to say, \"Keep watching.\"So, I hate to say this, but this first season is technically a better first season.Sure, I was upset with the dismantling of a few key episodes. Particularly, I was bothered that Jet only ever met Katara, and that the mechanists didn't live in the northern air temple. However, these are minor gripes in the grand scheme of things.This season is more focused, with an ingenious dedication to the best parts of the original show. I was surprised at how much I loved this version of Sokka and Zuko, and very satisfied with the portrayal of Aang and Iroh. I never loved season one Katara, but I warmed up to her character in both shows. The fire lord is the only character I didn't love the portrayal of, but it's made up for by scenes we didn't get to see before.There were at least five additions that were not in the original show that made me cry. The Airbender massacre, Iroh's son's funeral, Zuko's banishment scene, Zuko's crew, and the Water Tribe women.I didn't cry once rewatching season one of the original ATLA, like I do at season two and three... These changes were that good.The more I think about it, I could not be happier that this was made. I'm upset that more people aren't capable of grasping the purpose if this show. There are so many people who will watch this, who would have never watched the original show because it's some old cartoon. Sure, they are all wrong, but at least this show can prove how wrong they are!And for me, I fell in love with these characters all over again, and I'm excited to see if the improvements extend throughout the entire adaptation. I doubt they will, but now I have hope.","rating":"8\/10","date":"23 February 2024"}
{"title":"Not perfect, but a really fun and cool version of the story","review":"While not perfect and there were a few things that were disappointing, I honestly really enjoyed watching this. It was fun, the effects were very cool, I really appreciated the incorporation of so many martial arts techniques, and they changes they made to the story were not so far from the animated series to spark any kind of anger. The only annoying thing was the changes they made to water down Sokka and Katara a bit. HOWEVER, I really would like to see a second season because they left a lot open for the characters to grow and I would really like to see them develop the characters more in a second season. I really loved how they gave Azula a bit more screen time, because she was barely in the first season of the original. It also gave us some insight into her motives and what drives her. I understand that they had a lot of content to condense into only about 8ish hours, so it could not be copy paste. I am honestly glad it wasn't copy paste for it all because they would've just lacked any kind of depth. I am really interested to see where this goes and again I would really love to see a second season!!!","rating":"8\/10","date":"24 February 2024"}

Millenial humor further ruins the scenes and the dialogue seems to be written like a kids show with reactionary statements, over-emphasized lines, over-exposition, and cliched. Couldn't bare to watch it for more than 5 episodes after which i had to quit because at that point it just felt like torture to continue watching.A beloved childhood show is ruined with amateur writing.

{"title":"woah why is everyone so mad about this?","review":"I was completely caught off guard by the amount of hate for this show when I really feel like in terms of live adaptations and also in terms of just Netflix's usual quality of shows this is pretty standard. So yeah I was confused when I gave it a try and had a GREAT time watching it. From what I can tell... people wanted a copy and paste the original. I just watched a 2 minute video of someone complain about sokka not having his classic weapon and could only conclude it really isn't that deep just give it a try. Go into it open minded if you don't like it by I'd say episode 3 (although episode 4 is when I admit it went from a 7 to an 8 for me, the pilot was I admit a 6) then it's prob not for you.So here's what I think you should know going in;\nI thought zuko, iroh, the fire lord, and at times sokka were the standout performances. Honorable mention for azula as well.Aang and katara are the most different. If their romance is important to you or you want their personality exactly the same then don't watch. I took them as they were and thought of this as almost an alternate reality. A what if Aang was more serious? If you will. I think it translated a lot better to live action. If I'm completely honest it would have felt stiff if Aang was all happy go lucky in the middle of the war in live action. Animation does this easier but with real people things just had to be different and it's a fresh take I enjoy.It's DARKER, the tone is not comedic but I'm not saying it's somber and depressing, it's just something new. And it is a war story so not really that surprising.Things are DIFFERENT plot wise. I am a hardcore fan of the animated show and nothing will ever beat it and I DO NOT want to see them try and copy that if I'm honest. Definitely not in 8 episodes. Some scenes and things in animation as much as I love them would look cringy and weird in live action (like zuko yelling about honor constantly lol or aang making silly faces) some things are sacred to animation in my opinion and I don't want them touched.My biggest gripe is prob when I was like woah slow down a bit like they crammed a lot of plot into one season. But unfortunately the world we live in means television now tried to do this in order to get picked up for a second season and it's a double edged sword of trying to get viewers invested but the pacing feels horrible. This wasn't a big deal for me cause if I'm honest a lot of shows do this now and it is what it is. It doesn't mean I didn't have fun lolLastly I feel like it has potential, I can see this being great in season 2 if it's given the chance. How many season 1s can people say are the best of a series? I mean look at the difference in acting and writing between sorcerers stone and prisoner of Azkaban am I right?If you wanna debate whether this even needed to be made? Sure I'll give you that, the source material was perfect in some ways so what can they really do better. I personally found a lot of things I liked others might not, it's your prerogative? Give it a try before listening to loud negative reviews you might shed a tear like I did when I heard the little soilder boy music score.","rating":"8\/10","date":"26 February 2024"}

I get why the original creators backed out. Every episode was cringe. The only thing I'll give them is the Katara and Paku fight was pretty close to the cartoon, but the whole build up to it wasn't. The worst thing they did in the show was making Iroh a killer. The whole Iroh character was off in my opinion and I know it was going to be hard to replace the original but come on.

Getting rid of the original writers and creators of Avatar the last Airbender was the worst decision Netlix made for the series. I can see why they left. The story is extremely serious and dark. There is little to no laughs. Maybe a chuckle or two in the 8 episodes but nothing like the animated series.

{"title":"True to the OG series","review":"Here's what to expect:1. Acting - (3\/5 stars) First and second episode will make you cringe how bad Aang's acting performance is. But episode 3 and onwards, the kid seems to feel more natural. Which is a relief. Everyone else's acting is good.2. Action - (4\/5 stars) I really enjoyed the fight scenes. The bending looks great.3. Story - (5\/5 stars) surprisingly, they stuck closely to the OG storyline. A few things the either left out or altered slightly. But overall, I'm happy about it.4. Humor - (4\/5 stars) I'm surprised they were able to replicate the humor from OG. Sokka is great.5. Overall - Definitely not as great as the OG but I'm really enjoying the series and I think you will too IF you're a fan of the OG.","rating":"8\/10","date":"23 February 2024"}
{"title":"Some flaws but solid overall","review":"I have to preface this by saying i'm the biggest ONE PIECE fan and after watching this I feel robbed , the visuals here are absolutely stunning, the acting does give off sunday tv vibes but it has its charm. So I wonder why people are reviewing this more harshly than one piece when it's more visually appealing and keeps the original narrative structure unlike the former.Realistically though it has its flaws, it's a bit lacking direction wise, the acting feels a bit cheap and a lot of the characters have lost their comedic traits which is one of the biggest selling points in the cartoon.Overall still very enjoyable with top notch visuals.","rating":"8\/10","date":"23 February 2024"}

{"title":"A Disappointing Adaptation","review":"As a fan of the original series, I couldn't help but feel let down by the adaptation. The attempt to pack every significant scene from the original series into the movie resulted in an inconsistent and confusing storyline. It felt like the essence and emotions of the characters were sacrificed in favor of spectacle. While the visuals were impressive only at times, with slow fighting effects by the inexperienced actors, the series failed to capture the heart and soul that made the animated series so beloved. It seems the series prioritized political correctness and dazzling effects over the rich emotional depth of the characters.","rating":"4\/10","date":"10 March 2024"}
{"title":"it doesn't take much","review":"It doesn't take much to be better than M. Night Shamalot; faithfully represent the original material, pick some substance over style and leave the foolish gimmicks back in 1999 where they belong.It also doesn't take much to disappoint a bunch of stans, bunch of folks' childhoods encapsulated in each precious episode, looking for that 1:1 recreation of their memories. And everyone wishes television (streaming) had the same resources as WB Discovery and can hire award winning directors like Craig Mazin working with the original creators like Neil Druckmann--every change meticulously chosen to add more depth to 'The Last of Us.' But Avatar's original creators bailed on Netflix's vision, you know, creative differences. Netflix isn't exactly known to incubate great talent into the world, they're highly successful if they can put out a third season or series in the highly competitive numbers game of subscription services.So appreciate what good we got, it's better than the film adaptation, although not what the original creators would've made live action but still better than what they did to our precious 'Cowboy Bepop.' Just remember, lower expectatioins, Netflix is a hybrid technology company pretending to be a media company, unless you forgot they got started with trading DVDs.","rating":"8\/10","date":"22 February 2024"}
{"title":"Don't let the hate, put you off","review":"Don't be put off by the hate being spread about this series. The animated series purists will never be happy because they do not like change and that's ok for them.But if you want to experience a new take on this, definitely take a seat and enjoy all it has to offer.Yes it's different, but why would you want to watch something that's exactly the same? The atmosphere of the world this series sets feels very real and delivers a darker sense to the war being waged by the fire nation.The casting is great, the characters progress as the series goes on. I for one can't wait to see more and hope that Netflix renews it for future seasons.But hey, don't just rely on the words of strangers. Go make your own decision.","rating":"10\/10","date":"29 February 2024"}
{"title":"Love it","review":"It's so well made, the actors did a great job. I enjoyed it so much. It takes you into this beautiful world, it gave me Harry Potter kind of vibes, where it creates an amazing phantasy world. The cast is perfect, and is doing phenomenal. So happy they made this show and I really hope much more is to come. The plot is of course a bit different - like it always is, just get over it and enjoy it instead of always searching for the hair in the soop.I don't understand why some people always feel bitter and need to talk down the show. True Avatar fans will appreciate it, some film- professional wanna-bes not.","rating":"10\/10","date":"24 February 2024"}
{"title":"Stands pretty tall with the OG Avatar","review":"So yes they changed some plot lines, some details here and there and there was no mention of the winter solstice, Roku is a prankster. But I think given the budget they had and how they needed to fot everything in 8 episodes, I think they've done damn good job.And like others have been saying, the cartoon will always be superior but I don't fans will be disappointed. They've done an amazing job at retaining designs, characterizations, scenery is beautiful and 95% matches the original. Just look at the view of Omashu, couldn't have brought that city back to life any better.I think Zuko could be a bit more angry to portray how he was in the show and Azula is less more insecure less a prodigy but conniving as always it would be nice to watch here invade Ba Sing Se. But however it is, ill take it, its an amazing production that creatively matches the original with some differences.","rating":"9\/10","date":"22 February 2024"}
{"title":"Meh","review":"Bring back the old writers\u00f0\u0178\u02dc\u00ad so far I've only watched the first two episodes and they've completely butchered it. Spent more time complaining about the writing than actually enjoying the show. CGI was pretty dope tho.First of all angs intro was straight up disrespect to say the least. Sure he wakes up In the avatar state, but then he ends up leaving apa? I don't think so. Also not sure why he all of a sudden has a bison whistle.Don't even get me started on Sokka. Dude it's been 2 episodes and I hate him. He's supposed to be the sarcastic meat lover guy and he's just straight up annoying... I'm sitting beside my two vegan sisters watching this and they're both pissed. Also them finding momo in a bag? Anyway I'm gonna keep watching...I mean complaining.Actings good for the most part.","rating":"3\/10","date":"22 February 2024"}
{"title":"I love it","review":"Note: I'm only to episode four but I'm loving it so far. I don't know what all these other reviews are about. The creators did such a good job with restructuring the story so that it doesn't lose the integrity or the charm of the animated series. Yes, the dialogue is simple, but it was as well in the animated series. Give it a chance and it may surprise you. If you're hoping for an exact remake of the original version and will be bummed that it is not, then it may not be for you. For me, it was an exciting opportunity to relive watching a beloved series for the first time...again. You also have to understand that there are certain parts of the story that the producers had to consolidate for continuity or time purposes, so there are a few times when characters show up in places where they weren't before. I love this series and I am loving the series so far.","rating":"10\/10","date":"24 February 2024"}
{"title":"A for the visual!","review":"Ahaaa, we need to remember that the live action will be different from the book. We can't force everything to be the same as our expectation. I start with A for the visual beacause the way they visual the places in this series was cool, and depiction of 4 elements during several fights were great, i admit that.About the performance.... their performance were actualy good but the depth of characters was lacking. When they (Aang, Katara, and Sokka) first met, it was less emotional, and also talking too much about responsibilities throughout episodes, I mean.... we need humor. Don't we?The first episode made me so emotional, I cried hehe. Honestly it's the best episode.","rating":"8\/10","date":"25 February 2024"}
{"title":"Long time fan of the original series","review":"I am a devoted fan of the original cartoon series done on Nickelodeon. I've watched the original series over ten times through. I could quote it by heart. I feel that I have every right to voice my opinion on this. This adaptation is beautifully executed. The characters are perfectly casted, the story is masterfully adapted for the big screen. The characters are brought to life in a real world way, yet it feels like they are their original cartoon selves. I couldn't have asked for a better live action. Give it a shot, and don't go in with your nose in the air. Don't be a snob about it. You'll love it.","rating":"10\/10","date":"25 February 2024"}
{"title":"10\/10 just because i believe in its potential","review":"Like many other reviewers I will say that the CGI and cast are perfect, but storytelling and pacing falls short. I'm giving it a 10\/10 just because I believe netflix will pick up on feedback, invest in more episodes and development and make a banger in season 2. Especially with toph beifong. It has almost all the right ingredients, just the seasoning is wrong. I even like how they adapted the fire nation family storyline. Netflix needs to invest in more episodes per season allowing all the plotlines to fully develop and the charcters to mature naturally. I'm firmly holding on to the hope that just like the original, season 1 will be the worst season.Just to recognise what exactly they did well:Casting of Dallas Liu as Zuko ( My favourite, even though he wasn't in the animation)\nCasting of Iroh, Azula, Ty lee, Ozai, Monk Gyatso, Commander Zhao and Sokka\nAdaptation of the Royal Family Story\nThe more gruesome elements of war introduced\nAlmost every action scene, especially those with firebending\nBackstory being a bit more developed aswell as Monk Gyatso being explored more appropriately\nKYOSHI GOING NUTS\nAlmost All aspects of CGI (Sometimes it could be slightly clunky but nothing compared to the highs of the bending battles and Koh)And what they could improve on:\nPacing of episodes - the episode on 'Omashu' and its following up just tied in Jet's story with Bumi ,Secret Tunnel, Another new plot line and Zuko and Iroh. There was just too much happening\nSomehow Katara just masters water bending. Aang doesnt even use waterbending and Pakku doesnt bother really training them? Another issue with pacing\nDevelopment of characters - Aang and Zuko were explored in great depth but Katara and her waterbending arc was missing\nExcessive exposition (especially aang) - Show not tell please\nFlat moments (Aang and Katara) - Child actors so understanable. Katara however was the weakest casting imo.Come on Netflix, Give us another One piece. I really believe in you.","rating":"10\/10","date":"22 February 2024"}
{"title":"Another poorly written Netflix adaptation","review":"Netflix has done it again. They managed to take a show we all know and love and turn into a beautiful, empty husk. The visual effects and costume design is gorgeous and does justice to the original series. This is where the positive part of my review ends. About two-seasons-worth of plot points are dumped on the viewer in the first twenty minutes. The characters, motivations and story are convoluted so badly that it is doubtful whether any of the (remaining) writers actually watched the show. The cringe-worthy dialogue lacks all subtlety and gives no quarter to the basic rule of \"show don't tell\". Even the soundtrack is bland and unimaginative, trying to compensate for its mediocrity with the occasional tease of nostalgic leitmotifs. One day Netflix are going to make an adaptation that manages to retain the soul of the original production, but it is not this day.","rating":"2\/10","date":"22 February 2024"}
{"title":"After 19 years the AVATAR IS BACK!","review":"Before the trailers coming out everyone thought that it will be something like the other live action( which doesn't exist. The fans know) but trailer by trailer it was getting better and better and now we are here and its amazing. The bending part and visual effects are great(except airbending and even that is good) and in the first ep it gives you backstory that the animation doesn't and also that is quiet good. As almost everyone knows the story has changes compare to the animation and they are good. Personally i prefer a step by step live action but this is also good. The act of actors isn't that well but it's acceptable. The acting weakness feels especially in the emotional scenes but in the fighting scenes they act really good. By the way if you are the fan of the ATLA or if you just like it, i strongly recommend you to watch it.","rating":"10\/10","date":"22 February 2024"}

If I start watch something and don't go eat and sleep then it's something special for me.First of all I want say thank you to writers. Finally good script and I can't find any illogical actions. Music also good and you want listen main soundtrack again and again. I was afraid that young actors will play not so good but I can say I was wrong and they do their best. CGI is great especially for TV series.I can recommend watch these TV series every human being. Because in this hard times everyone needs Avatar.","rating":"10\/10","date":"1 March 2024"}
{"title":"Apparently for kids but it's good","review":"So I played the first episode and it was like for school kids show. But then it said PG so I continued watching. The show continued in the same way with no changes but by episode 3 I started enjoying it. Apart from the fact that it's for teenaged kids at most , it's a very well directed show with all actors acting extremely well. The script is also well written and at least in season 1, the writers have worked hard on building consistent characters. This though makes the show more predictable and that's the only downside; if it's a war then avatar should also be killing but doesn't so let's see how it turns. Shall be waiting for season 2.","rating":"9\/10","date":"3 March 2024"}

{"title":"I wish Aang acted like his age","review":"The cartoon portrays a goofy and lovable pre-teen trying to deal with the tragedies and tribulations of war really well. The way he would try to have fun everywhere he goes whilst still prevailing in his more \"serious\" avatar duties would make the show more enjoyable. I do like the actors though. The Zuko backstory was also a nice touch. I do not like the fact that everything has to ends with \"I do know how to be the avatar\". Avatar Aang does ask for help once in a while but I feel as they made him overly reliant on his companions. He just always seems so depressed all the time. When I'm watching a hero on a screen I want them to be human while at the same time finding fun in their day to day life especially if they're a kid.","rating":"5\/10","date":"9 March 2024"}
{"title":"Great work! Thank you","review":"After 20 years and for a new generation, the team behind this show has done a great job! The kids loved it and so did we. I read quite a few negative reviews and criticism going around which seems so ridiculous. In my opinion the actors did justice to the characters and the visual effects were superb. After all its meant for our next generation, and seeing the kids eager to watch every episode brought back memories when I would wait for the next cartoon show every week. As far as \"the real audience and critics\" are concerened this show gets a 10 out of 10! So kudos for a job well done and looking forward to the next season!","rating":"10\/10","date":"23 February 2024"}
{"title":"Not the animated series, but still very good","review":"If you are looking for the story to be dragged out longer, watch the animated series. Sadly with the way kids grow up fast, they don't have that luxury. With that in mind, they did well with the live action series so far. There are some things that have been thrown together, but again it is understandable with not a whole lot of time on their hands.It has some light humor, Sokka is still arrogant at times and is still able to grow. One review claimed that the acting was robotic or something similar. That is not true at all. That is far from the truth and it feels as if they didn't really watch more than the first episode.I for one, really want to see more of this series and hope they don't change it too much due to length. There are some things missing, but give it a chance. Keep in mind the time constraint they had making this. It isn't a series that they can drag out and watch the kids grow up, it is one where a lot of time doesn't pass. It all takes place in one year's time.\"Don't count your chickens before they hatch.\" -- saying I heard growing up.","rating":"10\/10","date":"23 February 2024"}

One thing I liked the most is they started it from the beginning rather then Aang having flashbacks of the past 100 years. Rest everything is just top notch from sets to bending techniques I just love this show. Morever this show was my favorite from my childhood so pure nostalgia. You can say a blast from the past. I remember when in 2007 I just used to wake up early to watch ATLA on Nickelodeon and this Netflix ATLA is reminding me my old good days. Thanks Nickelodeon for making childhood awesome and thanks netflix for bringing memories back.","rating":"10\/10","date":"29 February 2024"}
{"title":"Why Aang!!","review":"They did such a good job bringing the world of Avatar to life, from the awesome CGI and effects to the beautiful costumes and sets. They also made it a lot more violent which surprised.However, a huge but: the acting and the writing are horrendous. I don't expect a one-for-one copy of the cartoon, but they should use the material that works and build on it in a positive way.The characters are boring with no real development or character arcs. They lack the charm and cheekiness of their cartoon counterparts, feeling all over the place-too serious and not fun due to a mixture of writing and acting.Some of the writing and acting are abysmal, especially in parts. While most of the terrible acting results from the actors doing their best with terrible lines, it's not the biggest problem.Aang is the worst part, constantly breaking the fantasy of the show. The kid can't act, making it cringe to watch him try to convey wisdom or have a monologue with Appa. Fair crack, the writing is abysmal, but it's more than just poor writing.I hate to criticize a kid, but maybe he's not the right one for Aang. He was awkward and seemed to be overacting, making it tough to believe when he was on screen. There were times when he seemed alright, but his acting, especially with that forced voice, reminded me of a cringe-worthy high school play.Watching his performance makes me think the movie Aang might have been a better choice. Just my opinion, and no hate to the kid.","rating":"5\/10","date":"2 March 2024"}
{"title":"Masterful execution of the story","review":"I enjoyed the original cartoon very much, but was sadly disappointed when the movie came out. However This is live action series by Netflix has done a great job, making sure that this series lives up to the original story. The special effects are adequate but the casting has been spectacular. The young actors they chose to play the Avatar and Zuko in particular are amazing. They are believable, and they make you empathize with the internal struggles of their respective characters. Great job, Netflix!

{"title":"Although not perfect, overal it was fun, nostalgic here and there, emotional at times and it left me wanting more.","review":"I made an account here just to review these series. I am a big fan of the avatar series. I'll make it short: The actors casted were great and spot on! I didn't like Yue(white hair water tribe princess) when comparing her with the animated version, I didn't feel the actress was the right one for the role but that is alright as her story ended in this season. From here onward the only problematic caracter(s) that I feel might benefit from a different actress is Azula and also her team; they should apear in the next seasons and none or them give me Azula team vibes. Otherwise, the rest of the casted actors are incredibly good for their plaied characters. The series changes a few things compared to the the animated version and seemed confusing at tumes but I loved them including changes in story with King Bomi and Zhuko's crew. Some parts seem rushed and could have benefited from more attention and time, CGI(virtuals) not perfect in some places but great in some other, the ending leaves you with wanting more and seems a little rushed but still good enough. Although not perfect, overal it was fun, nostalgic here and there, emotional at times and it left me wanting more. I would give it a 7.7 maybe 8 out of 10 and I really hope they continue the series, ideally put a little more work on attention\/time and CGI. I don't know if a recast of Azula team would be possible but this was a fun adventure and I hope for more and bettee!","rating":"8\/10","date":"25 February 2024"}

My family and I are very much looking forward to the next season.To be honest, when I started this series I did not have high expectations. Although there are some differences between this series and the original, I feel like most of the original storyline and spirit of the story are maintained.

But since she's an amateur, I don't want to say nothing bad about her skills.The story is great, I mean I felt like I'm part of that world.

Mid series I thought \"What am I watching, what does this has to do with the story shown? \"\nThe action sequences are cool, VFX are great, but then again, a rushed story.Few episodes have major major loopholes which will throw you off.The opening was promising but like most of the series it lost its plot mid way.Can watch it for the effects once, fast forward if u want, you won't miss much!! 5 stars only for the effects and the main character..","rating":"5\/10","date":"27 February 2024"}

Even tho not everything is 100% correct, it's not a problem, because after all, it's an adapatation. What I would praise the most:the bending coreography looks epicthe quality of the cgi is quite good, and even when it's not the best, it never gets too weirdthe costumes look greatand my personal favourite: the WORLD feels ALIVE. This happens when the producers don't spare on details: we see a lot of stuff happening in the background of the cities, the density of the population is okay, everything is visually stunning.Also, the series is a bit more brutal and more \"mature\" than the cartoon was, but it was exepctable and I think it was a really good decision.

Fighting scenes are very good, emotional speeches and conversations are also more or less good, especially when it comes to the firebenders. For example Zuko, Ozai, chubby Azula and our uncle. These firebenders as a bad guys are doing clearly good job.What I felt here is bit lack of humor?! I wanted more from Aang and Soka to show their childish and funny side, but maybe I was expecting too much. Maybe, the cartoons are making thing much funnier then it can be in the films. The various hilarious expressions of Soka in a cartoon are one of most memorable moments.","rating":"8\/10","date":"24 February 2024"}

Whilst I think it could have been better in some places, with a slow start and a spiritual journey that could have been better conveyed, it was still amazing :) The casting and VFX was excellent and they changed it to a good amount to make it very interesting. Far greater than another movie that shall not be named. I hope fans give this a chance and keep an open mind to this franchise, see it as a different show and you will love it, compare it too much to the original, and you might be disappointed.

I also think some people are just looking for an excuse not to like it because they didn't want it to begin with.The show isn't bad at all. It does have a more serious undertone than the original show, but I kind of expected that because it's a live action version. With the cartoon, of course they're able to capture the playfulness and humor easily.I'm only on Episode 4, but so far they've stayed true to the original with slight variations. Also to be expected. Overall, I rate it an 8\/10 so far.

So exciting to see season two and beyond on Netflix!\uf8ff\u00fc\u00eb\u00e8\uf8ff\u00fc\u00e8\u00e6\uf8ff\u00fc\u00eb\u00e8\uf8ff\u00fc\u00e8\u00e6\uf8ff\u00fc\u00eb\u00e8\uf8ff\u00fc\u00e8\u00e6Plus what I like about the show that there are expanded more stories with characters at the same that they still stick to source material which is phenomenal and super promising! Special effects looks so unique and realistic which that was absolutely better than movie.The casts, crews, producers, directors, set designers, showrunner, writers and everything knows what they doing and to make the show justice which is so positive!","rating":"10\/10","date":"22 February 2024"}
{"title":"Great Live Action Adaption","review":"As someone who had only seen clips of the anime before watching the live-action adaptation of ATLA, I really enjoyed it. The casting was spot on. I decided to watch the anime version as it is available on Netflix and Vudu. The live-action is more serious and is missing a little humor. However, that is just minuscule compared to the great effects and storytelling of the show. You really can't expect live actors to act like cartoon characters just to have comedic chops; that would be farcical. I really wish they would get renewed for seasons 2 and 3 soon. Overall, the show captured and conveyed the essence of the original anime. It is always hard to please the fanatics, but I stan and highly recommend this show.","rating":"10\/10","date":"27 February 2024"}
{"title":"5% of the time its perfect. The rest is very wrong.","review":"This is more to vent than anything. The show started off solid. IF you are hating the show 2 episodes in, I promised you it only gets worse.The acting by Sokka and Zuko is solid, Aang and Katara look a little lost, and the rest of the characters arent their characters. I do appreciate the direction with zhao, but that said, not sure why they thought some of these cuts work.The worst part is the story direction and lack of respect of even the most crucial plot points. Even on limited time they start sprinkling in season 2 plotlines and coming multiple episodes without regard. Some changes serve no purpose and only break canon.Just skip this and stick to the animated show, it's exponentially better and this show will likely be cancelled after season 2 because whoever was in charge of season 1 will likely still be around.","rating":"4\/10","date":"8 March 2024"}
{"title":"Review by an avatar loving critic","review":"I'm not even gonna mention slum dogs disastrous previous adaptation.This adaptation however delivers on all the aspects that made 'that' version .. universally derided.This new adaptation is a very strong show, if you've seen the original.Now onto specifics: The Casting\nThe cast was almost immaculate. It's nice to see in a show about four (essentially) Asian nations that the overwhelming majority of characters not only ARE from the countries depicted by the four nations, they also managed to make them look like their character part. Sokka is the exception as the character played by him looked and sounded too like cartoon sokka to let him go, despite not being indigenous, they nailed it with Sokkas actor, like to the level they may have made a robot specifically to play this character.Many characters were cast very well; katara, aang, iroh and the tinkerer and his disabled son. Some like Bumi and Azula and maybe even Zuko weren't well cast.Character:\nI do have some problems with the way the characters have changed in this adaptation. In short, it plays into the banality of evil.Many characters like Aang, Katara, Sokka, the cabbage man, Jet, the minstrels, all straight from the show, very little changes.But characters like Iroh, Firelord Ozai, Admiral Zhou, even King Bumi are drastically different from how they are depicted in the show:Bumi was an angry ptsd veteran of the hundred year war.Iroh was a feeble, blubbering, sad eyed child figure.Ozai and Zhou had the same problem; when we saw firelord commanders or even the firelord, there was a sense of power, music, atmosphere, they way they callously did things and their cold and monotone, but expressive voices. Everything they did in the show to make the fire nation higher ups be intimidating and scary was removed for this adaptation. While Daniel Dae Kim makes an excellent Ozai, he is not believable as the FIRE LORD, he looks like and acts like any normal firebender, maybe even a little more reserved, but not evil, just b*tchy.Commander Zhou gets the same treatment, he is portrayed as a bumbling, lucky, inept commander who chanced upon his fortune, speaking with a sort of passive aggressive yet submissive tone. Instead of the original wicked smart Zhou, who politicked his way to the top of the fire navy and was a firebending master that spoke like a cold winters night (Jason isaacs\uf8ff\u00fc\u00f2\u00e2)The Worldbuilding\/Set Dressing\/CGI\nThis is where this new adaptation has really excelled, creating and bringing to life absolutely beautiful and faithful reproductions of the Avatar world and it's cities and animals.The scene settings are excellent at showing the four nations as being inspired by 4 real world indigenous and Asian cultures, this is even more pronounced from the original show due to the actors both looking and sounding like the people depicted in it.The Animals are wonderful. They're seen as kind of zany on the original avatar, and everyone seems to really know they're two animals combined (and are confused by just a 'bear'). On this show however, the animals feel real, integral, and not spoken about. They look magnificent, as does all CGI in the show, plus the CGI stays consistently good and satisfying.One addition to the cgi I really admired was the 'darkening' of characters such as Habai and Koh the Facestealer who both looked horrifyingly beautiful.The Plot:\nThis will be short, as the director producers have clearly taken a different direction, and I won't be able to review how good the plot is until all three parts have ended. Some things that should've happened didn't, and some things that shouldn't of happened, did.Minor changes are made, such as aangs experience in Omashu that I didn't appreciate (which relates to how they changed Bumi's character)And while I understand they might be trying to make us realise\/feel that this is literally a little kid, who has to face the most powerful man in the world, and I'm all for that, but then why make the changes to Ozai or Zhou like I mentioned before? Surely keep the ominous and softly terrifying vibe for the fire nation whilst making us realise aang is a child?The only way I could see that made the fire lord, or any of his commanders scary or threatening, was that they mention twice that the firelord is okay sacrificing a few battalions to achieve a major victory. But that's not evil, it's just war, and not even necessarily a choice that only an evil regime would make.Maybe they're going for a banality of evil thing, but that doesn't work if they aren't made evil in the first place.","rating":"8\/10","date":"26 February 2024"}
{"title":"Better than 1st Live Action, but pales in comparison to original show.","review":"This will be a performance list of the actors.There were more pros than cons, so keep that in mind.Actor's Performances (some good, some bad)\nAang- 7\/10 - decent, i liked the swaying of the burden of being the avatar had on him, but sometimes it was too much sway.So any true fan know who he ends up with and in this version, it makes it feel like there is a wide age gap, like Aang 11 to Katara 15 or 16.Katara - 8\/10 - she is a good support character like in the show, her development is good. She is also a good anchor in keeping aang connected to the world.Sokka - 9\/10 - he is similar enough to the show where he was enjoyable.Zuko - 5\/10 - he just felt like a grumpy baby vying to win to daddys respect, which is source, but i feel like they played too much into that.Iroh - 9\/10 - I love Paul Sun-Hyung Lee and thought he interpreted the character well. The only thing lacking was the sass that Iroh had, there was no funny banter or teasing, that was lacking, but the essence was there and it was enjoyable.Ozai - 8\/10 - he is almost as good as the show, he lacks only a little bit more cruelty. I felt like he needed to be angrier than he was. Talks about weakness then almost shows that same weakness.Azula- 1\/10 - I think she was the farthest from source, she just felt like the big baby of a sister. I never felt any threat coming from her and the show would not disappoint on that. The ending had no credibility on her part. Maybe if they spent a little more time, like even a minute, on how she won, then i could maybe see her development.","rating":"8\/10","date":"26 February 2024"}
{"title":"A strong adaptation of the beloved original that isn't afraid to dive deeper into the motivations and nuances of our favorite characters","review":"I went into this with cautious optimism - and was really happy with the outcome. The core messages and story arcs of the original series come through well in this adaptation, enriched by some incredible visuals and combat scenes. Just about every character was well-cast, but the acting was wooden at times. Definitely plenty of room for improvement, and it was disappointing at times to feel like so much was rushed and cramped into each episode, but I really enjoyed the experience. Most of the changes from the original show felt like they came from good intentions, and in many cases allow us to dive deeper into the characters and their motivations.I se a lot of people nitpicking some changes that, to me, are not a concern. Having an open-mindedness to these changes actually made the experience much more enjoyable and refreshing. In many cases people seem to have a misunderstanding of the core motivations and nuances of the characters in the original series, and in most cases the changes here actually dove even deeper into them in ways that was drew me in.As an example, Katara's character felt much more reserved than the original, but even though I was disappointed by that, it still l felt like Katara. As long as she grows into a more passionate and outspoken member of the team, I think this change could actually add to the impact of her arc.","rating":"9\/10","date":"23 February 2024"}

{"title":"netflix strikes again","review":"I REALLY tried to enjoy this. I've watched the animation series a million times, I collect the novels and graphic novels, I've had endless discussions about why the original ATLA is almost flawless.The source material is a clever and nuanced look at colonialism and genocide, packaged in a way that kids can consume, but NEVER dumbed down. This adaptation feels like in insult to the original and to the audience. It's as if Netflix wasn't sure whether their audience would be kids, fans of the original show, or fans of gritty dramas, and made a messy attempt to please everyone.The dialogue is dry, the acting is lacking (although, credit where it's due to the actors for Zuko and Katara - they were great), the pacing is off, and it's so VERY literal. 'Show don't tell' goes a long way. We don't NEED to see the (sensationalised) genocide of the air nomads. When the audience already knows exactly what happened at the temple, it dampens Aang's discovery that he is the last of his people. It's far less impactful!It missed the mark entirely. It seems Netflix wanted a vehicle to display their excellent SFX (props to the SFX team at least), and chose to turn a show about anti-violence and peaceful resolutions into a show about cool battle sequences.Worth a watch if you want something bland on in the background, but don't expect the Game of Thrones-ifiction of the original series that was promised.","rating":"5\/10","date":"23 February 2024"}

{"title":"Too rushed but new insights by relating the content","review":"The show didn't have that much character development, but people forget that the first book of the original series was much more linear and contained much less character development than the second and third. In my opinion they really thought about which parts of the show to blend together. For example they showed an interesting duality between collaboration and resistance, which didn't appear in the original show because the scenes appeared in different books.The visual effects were really impresssive. I have some experience in video editing and in my experience it is very difficult to make the air effects realistic, which this show did extremely well in my opinion.I am rewatching the original series right now, but I think I would rewatch this series if a second season comes out.Nevertheless there are also some bad things: the show is very rushed whereas the original is very chill. This is because the show has so much stuff introduced in this book already (for example azula is an important character, but was only introduced in the second season of the original). Another consequence of this is that there are not many mysteries that stay unresolved for long, which the original did have very often.The characters also do not portray the personalities of the original characters very well. For example, Ty Lee is not very optimistic, Azula is not as 'sharp' as in the series; only May is a bit melancholic. I think this is mostly because of the script and I don't really blame the actors for this. For example, Azula had to raise her voice to motivate some soldiers in the new series, while in the original series she would have delegated this.","rating":"9\/10","date":"2 March 2024"}

BUT.There are minor details that are missing from the original movie, it's the EYE LENS.. where the AVATAR, airbenders and other non benders should be grey or black, all the waterbenders is BLUE, firebenders is RED, and the earthbenders is GREEN.. I hope it could be fixed in the second season of this movie.","rating":"9\/10","date":"28 February 2024"}
{"title":"Not accurately portrayed","review":"I understand they wanted to make these series in a more serious note, but the part with King Bumi really was a let down. They completely ruined the surprise element for anng to realize of bumi's real identity , they made bumi be too serious when he's more of a cooky \/ laid back old person. They kept the end, with both bumi and aang sliding through the city ban ce se as but you would not get why they do that if you haven't seen the original series.Along with that, I feel the casting could have been closer to the animated characters, Azula needed to be more of an intimidating\/ cold hearted looking person, Zuko could have been a little more mature looking, I feel aang was the only one that had to resemble a kid. Gram gram had to be older.The spirit world is not meant to be seen by sokka or katara as seen in the series.","rating":"4\/10","date":"2 March 2024"}
{"title":"It's a great remake!","review":"Of course, the cartoon was great. I remember watching it when I was younger and my daughter and I just watched it again and she and we both loved it. We did watch the 2010 remake, and I did think that was awful. I didn't like and I didn't like the look. I didn't think it matched up very well. This one, however, my daughter and I were very engrossed and I think it's very similar to the actual cartoon. They did a great job. Some acting isn't great, but for the most part, they did a wonderful job. There were some cool features from my daughters perspective she absolutely loved it! I definitely recommend Its full of action, but also has great meaning.","rating":"10\/10","date":"10 March 2024"}
{"title":"Great way to start","review":"Watched the first episode and I'm impressed. To everyone who is over criticizing needs to understand that the main characters of the show are kids who don't have much experience while the voice characters were played by adults so the Aang and chemistry that you want won't be there initially but I do believe that they'll grow into it. My only criticism would be Uncle Iroh I just feel like he lacks that sense of humor and emotion depicted in the show. However I think they did an amazing job especially with the back story on why the other nations couldn't help the air nomads. So I have to give credit where it's due. Overall I am impressed.","rating":"9\/10","date":"22 February 2024"}

Because we know that Aang can communicate with them not only in temples.I think the episode Mask was amazing!!!

It's defiantly more mature than the original, but I love the way it's been translated to live action. Ian is blowing my mind as Sokka, he's perfect! And Gordon had me tear bending in the first episode, his performance is so vulnerable, especially for someone his age. Dallas is also insanely talented as Zuko, they couldn't have found anyone better! I really am so proud of everyone and all the work they put into bringing this show to life. Thanks for a wonderful show, it truly is incredible!","rating":"10\/10","date":"22 February 2024"}
{"title":"Great CGI. Flat acting and poor technical execution.","review":"I couldn't get past episode 2. The line delivery is poor and continues to get worse. There's also no respect for timing, whether its a comedic or dramatic moment. Actors don't seem to know how to listen to their co-stars, react, and play off of one another - they're all standing around waiting until it's their turn to deliver a line, and they do so histrionically and in isolation. I understand that these actors are young and inexperienced, but I would have expected a director to provide small adjustments to delivery, or encourage experimentation of other modes, that would have helped mitigate some of these issues.Overall it feels like an SNL skit more than a wholesome drama, and it results in something unbearably cringey to watch.I had hoped that the CGI (the bending is admittedly impressive) would compensate for any shortcomings, but unfortunately this isn't the case here. You can immediately tell when there's an amateur choice of angle, strange editing, and bad green-screening (take a look at when the Kyoshi warriors first appear - the background is miscolored and moves strangely against the actors in the foreground), all of which come to distract from the actual viewing experience.","rating":"2\/10","date":"27 February 2024"}
{"title":"Amazing, but not perfect.","review":"Just finished binging the entire show, unlike many, who have reviewed the show before it was even possible to have watched the entire show. A lot of people already judged based off episode 1, which doesn't give a good impression of the entire show. I'd recommend watching at least the first 3 episodes before judging.The show, obviously, isn't perfect. Neither is it meant to be a 1 to 1 remake of the original. It's unfair to be negative because of it not being 1 to 1, that wasn't the goal. The changes made were fine, definitely missed a few good moments from the original but that doesn't mean the life action is bad.I really like the visual effects, yes, it's obvious that it's visual effects in some moments. But that's to be expected. The visual effects are perfect for what they're supposed to be, bending the elements.The acting could have been better at times, but it was fine. Far from the best I've ever seen, but it didn't hold the show back. But the casting is amazing, the characters look and sound very similar to their cartoon counterparts.Overall, I'd say the show was very enjoyable, any Avatar fan would like it assuming they go in openminded and don't nitpick everything, if you nitpick about EVERY difference you'll hate it, don't watch it. This is hands down way better than the movie.I'd heavily recommend it to people who've seen the original show. And I'd recommend ignoring the reviews posted around release they, they've likely not seen the entire show.","rating":"9\/10","date":"22 February 2024"}

{"title":"Everything about this is wrong","review":"I was hyped up for this because the original creators were apart of this, so I figured it would at least be worth watching. Until they left over creative differences, so my worries began to grow. I've read the many average reviews and was even more worried but I figured I'd at least give it a try, and boy were the reviews right.This was just so disappointing and felt wrong from the very beginning. It's as if the original was the perfect meal you've ever had and then someone comes out and tries to replicate it but serves you the most bland, tasteless meal full of disappointment and despair that just makes you feel like a chump. I stopped watching it after the second episode and had to start the original just to get the awful taste out of my mouth.Special effects are ok, the acting effort is ok, the story is the same big picture but unfortunately without any of the character development scenes that let the characters grow into what they need to become. They even changed the crucial details that tied the whole avatar process with the moral of the story which was infuriating.Try it if you want but prepare to be disappointed.","rating":"4\/10","date":"10 March 2024"}
{"title":"Negative Reviews do not Stem from Reality","review":"Before saying anything else, I just want to know that a lot of these reviews do not stem from reality. This is a TV series with live actors and some of the demands are absurd. No, the first season could not have been split into two - the actors playing the kids would be 30 by the time this ends. No, there is no romance yet between Aang and Katara as one actor is a literal child and the other is of age. My theory on why there was no water bending - because they HAVE to do a time jump. The actor would have grown by the end of season two filming. They will learn water bending off-screen.Emotions are more subdued as this is a live action show. If characters were screaming at each other like in the animation or being that childish, it would have looked so off, you wouldn't believe. In animation everything is more. The had to tone it down.That being said, some narrative choices were weird. Some motivations were weirdly changed, especially going to the North due to a vision. Some mashing up together of stories left more to be desired. I feel like the spirit of the forest was especially cut off + the spirit with the many faces. Including the inventor storyline here was also weird as the moral dilemma about them living in the old nomad temple was interesting. Some acting was weird, off or weak. Some casting choices were... questionable. For this I would probably give it 7\/10 but I am upping it by one to counter these negative reviews.That being said, overall it was a very good adaption. It cut out a lot of the boring filler stuff of season 1. Most of the story combinations worked well. Zuko and Soka were stand-out performances for me - very close in feel to the originals. So far I like this version of Katara more, even though she is more subdued. The original Katara was a very annoying character. Aang is serviceable, given that he is played by a child. I am a bit let down by Uncle Iroh as he was a fave from the show. He needs to have a more carefree fa\u00c3\u00a7ade for Zuko's sake.The effects, choreography, music etc were high notch, Hollywood-movie level, even better. There was some awkward CGI but overall pretty good. I also did not mind the costumes.Was it perfect? No, by all means, no, but it was a pretty good show that was entertaining enough to binge-watch. I think there is promise in it, though they are facing some impossible tasks such as the casting of Toph. I hope we will get second season. Though people will probably give it 1\/10 since the actors have aged...","rating":"8\/10","date":"25 February 2024"}

Acting is very good considering they are trying to play cartoon characters with unrealistic expressions, dialogue and physical structure.

It was a kids show and should t be expected to have deep dialogue. Looking forward to the second season so we can see more than the story the movie touched on. Looking forward to the other characters that we will see and getting past this first season. I do hope there is more humor going forward as that was such a big part of the original series. Also hope they make the next season quick so the actors don't grow past the characters. Good work.","rating":"9\/10","date":"24 February 2024"}
{"title":"A very good live action adaptation","review":"I watched the original cartoon series and wasn't sure about watching this since the cartoon was so good. I was afraid of being disappointed or bored, but I was thoroughly impressed and binged the whole season in one night.I really liked the actors, they did a really good job picking the right people. The only one I'm not sure about is Azula.I don't mind that a few minor things were changed, it actually made the show more interesting. I honestly don't watch to watch the same exact thing again anyway. But overall they are keeping to the original story pretty well. I really don't understand what everyone is complaining about.Can't watch for the next season! I watched it with my son and he loved it. We both had moments of crying because the show can really tug at your heart strings at times.","rating":"10\/10","date":"11 March 2024"}
{"title":"Original Storyline: Amazing for fans of the original series.","review":"In this series of the Avatar the creators have taken the original animated series and given it their own twist. It is amazing to watch as a fan of the original series because I recognised elements from the original series in this one, but both series are still not quite the same. Therefore I was still excited about what was going to come next. This Avatar series is truly recommended.Some parts of the series did not catch my feelings that much and I felt that in some parts the story could have progressed a little bit quicker.The fighting seems really realistic. I feel like the series has grown with the kids that used to watch the animated series who have now become adults.TW Violence - Although the series is rated 12+, it has way more visible (extreme) violence in it than what would be expected from a 12+ series.CONCLUSION: recommended, especially because of the slightly altered story. Acting is good, but sometimes could have been better. TW for (extreme) violence.","rating":"9\/10","date":"24 February 2024"}
{"title":"My opinion this is amazing","review":"Loved it very unique but original loved the visual effects and each characters stories would love a part 2.i would like to see a bit more fighting scenes and more bending displayed but for the most part this was very entertaining to watch I really enjoyed the fighting scenes and very interested in what the next one will play out and can't wait for the next please add abit more fighting scenes and bending display and would like it to be longer anyways loves it keep Up the great work please do a part 2 I watched this since I was a kid and still to this day amazing job thank U guys can't wait to see what's next.","rating":"10\/10","date":"23 February 2024"}
{"title":"At least it's pretty...","review":"As usual I'm giving yet another live action adaptation, Avatar: The Last Airbender, a chance and this is what I think so far. It's very pretty, they spent a lot on special effects, locations, and it is evident. The effects are also very weird, for how pretty it is the effects also are a lot less 'good' on certain things, such as the animation of Appa. That being said, with every minute I watch it veers more and more into cash grab territory. The liberties and 're-interpretations' they take with the story, that is already well established, just make it really hard to like and watch. Also it's a little dark, the first few minutes they start off with a bunch of murders, kids can't watch this! I'll watch another episode to be sure but this is quickly falling into the territory of pointless like Cowboy Bebop.Conclusion: cash grab. This show is basically a CW show mixed with reality TV. I don't know how they wrote the lines for Sokka but clearly they never watched the original show. He didn't become all stoic and a great leader until much later in the series. Zuko, oh my goodness, they basically have made him into a blood thirsty ruthless monster instead of the dejected and very determined person he was in the original. If you find CW shows enjoyable then this live action adaptation is for you. If you'd like to experience the original cartoon, it is on Netflix and you should watch that instead. The Legend of Korra is on Netflix as well. Skip the cringe worthy live action version, it is not good.","rating":"3\/10","date":"23 February 2024"}
{"title":"A series that re-invented my childhood.","review":"For as long as I can remember, I have been a fan of the original series.To this day, I consider it to be one of the most influential titles in my life.It had a great impact on me.But even though many people seem to be a bit too pessimistic about this Live Action adaptation - It has given me something I haven't felt in a long time. It has made me fall in love with this franchise all over again.Most of the significant changes added to the story, only made the writing even more impactful.... I adore the straightened bond between Sokka and Katara...Katara's dialogue with Jet, Sokka's dialogue with the Mechanist, Aang's scenes with Gyatso, Bumi changing under the weight of responsability that rested on his shoulders for a hundred years....There has been many scenes that I wish were in the original series.I haven't felt so much joy and inspiration in a long time, not to mention the phenominal set designs, beautiful acting performances, stunning action scenes and music, that pays homage to the iconic score of Jeremy Zuckerman.","rating":"10\/10","date":"22 February 2024"}
{"title":"THIS IS WHAT A LIVE-ACTION ADAPTATION SHOULD LOOK LIKE!","review":"Avatar: The Last Airbender (2024) 9.5\/10The fact that the news and rumors of this series have been dragged all the way from 2018 makes me give kudos to everyone that has had one or two contributions to the success of the project. What a way to tell a story! What a way to let fans feel that the project is worth the wait! What a way to bring animation to life!ATLA excels in every aspect you can think of - the cast, the crew, the designs, the breath-taking realistic bending of the four elements, the tone, the pacing, the balance of the humor and tragedy, the faithfulness to the source material (even though some storylines were added for the sake of those that didn't watch the animated series), the soundtrack! Everything was just nostalgic... Kudos to the person\/people that worked on the soundtrack, they knew the assignment and they delivered!Aang's playfulness, Uncle Iroh's obsession with teas, Zuko's obsession with catching the Avatar and fulfilling his destiny, Katara's kindness, Sokka's sarcastic and comedic character were well portrayed. The Firebenders' ruthlessness, the Earthbenders' ruggedity, the Waterbenders' lukewarmness and the Airbenders' peaceful nature perfectly represented. They even pronounced \"Aang\" perfectly here... Lol.We all know that M. Night Shyamalan's 2010 live-action adaptation of ATLA was so easy to forget, but this Netflix's adaptation just further sends it into oblivion! If you haven't watched the animated version of ATLA, I'd really suggest you do, because I can't imagine myself trying to enjoy and bask in the satisfaction this masterpiece gives without watching the animated version.I can't wait for subsequent episodes and I really hope Netflix keeps to this quality or even get better with the coming episodes!

{"title":"Just watch it!","review":"If you're a fan of the original series, just watch it! Good for older kids and adults. The bending was great and the condensed story for book 1 was good! Very loyal to the original show. I would like to watch it again and am excited for them to keep it going! People are going to have their complaints - but it's a kids show with great actors and actresses - a great story and I felt inspired at the end. Most importantly it stayed loyal to the original show the entire time - with some minor tweaks. People complained about the CGI - but again, cgi for a cartoon and kids show..thought the CGI was just great!","rating":"10\/10","date":"26 February 2024"}
{"title":"Harmony Continues","review":"I dislike when people rate the new Avatar: The Last Airbender series poorly just because the original animated series was \"the best ever.\" It's essential to appreciate the original for its impact on our childhoods. However, I find it remarkable that they created this new series, and it deserves recognition.The new Avatar series manages to capture the essence of the original while introducing fresh perspectives and storylines. The animation quality is stunning, showcasing technological advancements that enhance the bending battles and elemental mastery. The character development is noteworthy, as it brings a modern touch to beloved personalities while introducing compelling new faces.One can't ignore the thoughtfulness put into addressing contemporary themes, making the series relevant for both nostalgic fans and a new generation of viewers. The storytelling is engaging, blending humor, suspense, and emotional moments seamlessly. The creators' dedication to world-building shines through, with intricately designed landscapes and cultures that enrich the Avatar universe.While the original will always hold a special place in our hearts, the new series stands on its own as a commendable addition. It's a testament to the enduring legacy of Avatar: The Last Airbender, proving that there's room for both appreciation of the classic and openness to innovative storytelling. So, let's not dismiss it outright but embrace the evolution of a beloved world we thought we knew so well.","rating":"10\/10","date":"22 February 2024"}
{"title":"I wanted so bad to love this.","review":"Let me begin by saying that my wife and I grew up on this show. This was our childhood and both of ours favorite kids show of all time. I admit I went in with high expectations but even if I had the lowest of standards, this show is just awful. It seems Netflix thought that if they showed us pretty visuals and accurate costumes, we would ignore the exposition dumps, the atrocious acting, the bland and unrealistic dialogue, the exclusion of pivotal character moments, and sprinkles of political correctness.I admit, visually, this is a stunning spectacle of cgi work. I did notice moments where there was an obvious green screen like when Sokka and Katara were rowing, but the sets looked really good. Also, Zukos actor stole the show. Seems he was an actual fan of the source material and definitely would make Dante Bosco proud.But everything else, will never come close to the original. Let's start with the acting. Aang and Katara being two central characters couldnt convince me that they werent auditioning for a high school play. Iroh was not funny nor charismatic (could be the writers fault), and Gran Gran looked bored beyond belief. Everytime a character besides Zuko talked, I was immediately cringing.Next thing was the dialogue. There were so many exposition dumps. Stop talking about an important scene and just show it. Not to mention the bland exchanges between the three central characters well so forced.Lastly, the political correctness. Ill only be covering the first episode. Female airbender being the most powerful, Sokka hiding behind Katara (HE WOULD NEVER DO THIS), Katara suggesting to use Appa, or most cringeworthy,, Katara being a girl boss and stopping Zukos fireball with a massive water geyser when she was previously shown to barely form a ball of water. Garbage forced pandering.DO NOT BELIEVE any of these positive review bombers. These people probably loved the new Star Wars. Giving 10s without watching the show because \"All criticism is just unneccesary negativity\" according to these snowflakes.","rating":"4\/10","date":"23 February 2024"}
{"title":"Best adaptation from Cartoon to Live Action","review":"Summary: Simply amazing, only big con is I have to wait for the next season.Whoever has watched the cartoon even if the memory is hazy, will immediately recognize the plot and characters portrayed in this live action adaptation of Avatar the Last Airbender.The casting is phenomenal, the VFX are insane, the choreography is splendid and the love for the original cartoon is more than obvious from viewing the first few minutes of episode one.Though it will never be perfect, (which is why I'd never give any property a 10\/10) in my opinion this is the best live action adaptation of any ip that I've been privileged to watch.A few minor changes from the source material to this live action itteration are not interfering with the quality at all and actually add a fresh breeze of air (pun intended) to this magnificent tv show.The only downside to this season is there's a sense of emptiness and craving for more left in my soul, so the creators better get to work so we can watch season two as soon as possible!","rating":"9\/10","date":"25 February 2024"}
{"title":"OMGG","review":"This is the best rendition BY FAR! The costume could be a lot better tbh but the graphics, the acting, the actors are all so reminiscent of the cartoon, whilst it is hard to replicate how the cartoon is made to live action, it is pretty good for how it is! There's just something about their costumes that just doesn't feel like good, there's something quite off about it, the make up looks good and real, but the costume is just doesn't feel like their clothes are truly lived in, it just feels like it's just there. I don't know maybe I'm nitpicking too much. But it's cute, charming and entertaining!","rating":"10\/10","date":"2 March 2024"}
{"title":"my pov about this series","review":"THIS IS PERFECT. Sorry to say, but this version make me feel safe about Netflix doing animation adaptation. The cinematographic, story, characters adaptation is enough not going too far and they don't make it 100% THE SAME like the original animation, they showed us something FRESH i mean more details that maybe we never knew in animation version. At least is way way better than the movie. I LOVE IT. Keep it good, Netflix and the whole cast and whoever people involve with this series.However, i gonna say some characters DOESN'T LOOK like what they supposed to be. Like Zuko appearance he looks so Chubby but thank god his acting just describe what Zuko gonna be like. And Azula she's the same like Zuko's Actor, chubby. I know maybe this is MY WILD opinion but, y'all know both Zuko and Azula supposed to be. Slimmer. But, its okay both actors do the great job for this series. We can't judge people appearance just like that easy, they do their best tho.","rating":"9\/10","date":"25 February 2024"}
{"title":"I appreciate the live action","review":"You can't ask for too much when the previous version we had of the movie wasn't that good. I found this version to be the most similar to the original series. Of course, not adding the small details but it has been almost a faithful copy of the series and the characters are very similar to those of the animated version. I appreciate the effort made by Netflix for taking a risk on this live action.I look forward to the second season and don't wait so long because of the ages of the characters.Negative comments should take into account that not all productions are taken into account for live action.","rating":"9\/10","date":"25 February 2024"}
{"title":"Worst Adaptation in History, Night Shyamalan movie is the godfather compared to this","review":"THEY CHANGED COMPLETELY EVERYTHING, they should have put it another name, they completely changed the whole story, they kept 0% of the original show, which is a masterpiece, only the name. The acting of the avatar is REALLY BAD, clearly the director shined by his absence, Night Shyamalan would have never casted such a bad actor, EVEN LESS for the main role!! And They made Aang as an adult in the body of a kid, but the whole soul of the show is him being a kid and growing up to develop the avatar as a guide to the world, and he was joyful, always giggling and doing kid's silly things, here it's basically an adult, so, the whole soul of the show is lost, also 90% the show are irrelevant scenes of the reign of fire, but the show is CALLED AVATAR!! They should have named it The Reign of Fire at least, so people dont get scammed, I lost 4 hours of my life watching 4 bad episodes that has nothing to do with the original material, in The Night Shyamalan movie at least they preserved the jokes, the soul of the characters and THE MAIN STORY!! Here it's completely different, there is a main female protagonist of the reign of fire that's not even in the original show!!! And she's in the 50% the scenes, Like COME ON!! They clearly made it bad in purpose, they cant make it so bad without realizing they are changing 100% the story and the characters, I mean, 1 stupid person, maybe, but a whole crew of hundreds of people and no one realized it had nothing to do with the source material? Come on, they made it bad intentionally, they want to be remembered as the worst adaptation ever made and they BEG us to rank it with 1\/10, be my guest, here it goes!! 1\/10!!!!!","rating":"1\/10","date":"13 March 2024"}
{"title":"Nice show","review":"I really think they did a nice job. The changes to the original are rational and understandable. It's a modern version for adults and should work for fans of the original and also for someone who is new to the story. It's enjoyable to watch and the casting decision are well done. Some episodes are a bit to packed with story so the protagonists kind of rush through it. Sometimes the costumes look tacky and I wonder if they want to give it a overall more cartoonish look, but I think that this is necessary and with that amount of money they could have done it better. On the whole this show was very entertaining and felt exactly like I expected it in comparison to the original.","rating":"9\/10","date":"25 February 2024"}
{"title":"Captures the Spirit of the Original","review":"I can't with all the negativity. In my opinion, the show stays true to the spirit of the original. There is still a hint of the humor that made the original stand out, although not as much. Some people say this is just as bad as the movie, but I strongly disagree. While there are some changes I may not fully agree with, I also don't want a carbon copy of the original. One aspect I appreciate about the show is the decision to cast relatively unknown actors. My personal favorites are the actors for Sokka and Zuko, and I am particularly impressed by Gordon's portrayal of Aang. Kiawentiio also shows great potential as an actress. If there is a second season, I am eager to see how Katara's character evolves. Overall, the show is superbly executed.","rating":"8\/10","date":"23 February 2024"}
{"title":"Brilliant adaptation of a known story","review":"First of all for all the fans out there think back to the episode of ember island players. It was a known story told in a brief moment through the eyes of the fire nation. It brought for team avatar all kinds of emotions but mainly entertainment. That's exactly what's being done in this live action adaptation. It's the same story, the same lines, the same characters but with a different setup with extra knowledge. So 4 episodes from the original will be brilliantly mixed in a similar location.Very beautiful special effects, lovely music themes, nice casting, perfectly acting and well done for the make up, props and dressing teams.And a brilliant way of sowing known story lines, the original and new content.So for the newbies: welcome to the world of avatar, their is a lot to discover in books, comics and the series. And hopefully Netflix will continue their story with the planned adaptation of other untold stories.","rating":"10\/10","date":"26 February 2024"}
{"title":"People Are both correct and excessively harsh","review":"So, there are many things about this series to explore, I'm going into the fourth episode as of the moment, so my mind can definitely be changed. Here are main takeaways though:-The acting is decent, it feels awkward and flat at points for example, some of the interactions between Katara, Sokka, and Aang in the first episode and the romance between Suki and Sokka in the second.-The changes make sense. People may disagree on this, but there's an entirely different tone between real life people and animated characters. Capturing the kind of goofy nature that mirrors a very dark topic is difficult. They definitely work some humorous moments in, but it's certainly more serious than the original show.-Some of the shots feel strange. The bending looks amazing, but they could've made some better creative choices with the CGI alongside some of the camera angles. It doesn't look like crap, quite the opposite honestly. It just feels off occasionally.-They do a very good job at maintaining important character arch's and plot points so far. You're definitely not watching the original show, but if that's what you want then watch it. Don't bother with an adaption. I think the creative decisions make sense though, they fall in line with what the characters need to learn.-The first episode is very fast paced, but that's the nature of the beast. They wanted to present the actual events of the genocide, and I think that background sets the tone for the series. Due to that, the first episode and a half are consistently hitting major plot points so it's a little speedy, but it does start to calm down a bit and flow into the third episode.Overall, so far, I think it's a well made faithful adaption that's a little more on the serious side of things. It's still playful, but it's definitely different. I don't find it to be a \"bad\" type of different, but the focus on certain plot points come from a new angle is interesting to see.","rating":"8\/10","date":"22 February 2024"}
{"title":"Its... so corny","review":"Like I know the show is for kids but like the flow and the dialogue and the whole thing kinda embarrassing to watch sometimes.The setting is beautiful, the colour palates are nice, the props and the fight scenes are good, but like the actors are all over the place. The acting ranged from wooden to over the top to cringe. Uncle iroha is good though. I like his character the best and this is coming from someone who doesnt watch the original show.The one that played Aang is serviceable enough... he looked the part but the acting kinda varies and all over the place. He is still a kid so I gave him a pass but for as main character to carry the show, it needs to be carried harder.Maybe I should watch the original animation show afterall...","rating":"4\/10","date":"23 February 2024"}
{"title":"Not flawless, but significantly improved.","review":"Avatar: The Last Airbender\" on Netflix in 2024 delivers a visually stunning journey into the beloved world of bending and elemental mastery. With exceptional visual effects that breathe life into the bending arts, this adaptation pays homage to its animated counterpart while carving out its own space in the Avatar universe.From the sweeping landscapes to the intricately choreographed bending sequences, the visual effects team deserves commendation for their meticulous attention to detail. Each element, whether it be water, earth, fire, or air, is brought to life with vibrant energy and fluidity, captivating viewers with its immersive realism. The bending battles are particularly mesmerizing, showcasing the power and finesse of each element in dynamic and thrilling confrontations.However, despite the impressive visual spectacle, \"Avatar: The Last Airbender\" falls short of perfection in its adaptation. While it faithfully captures the essence of the original series, there are moments where the pacing feels rushed, and certain character developments lack the depth and nuance of the animated version. Purists may find themselves yearning for more faithful adherence to the source material, especially in regards to character arcs and plot intricacies.Nevertheless, the series shines in its portrayal of the central characters and their journey towards mastering the elements. Aang's journey as the Avatar is portrayed with sincerity and heart, capturing the weight of his responsibilities as well as his youthful exuberance. Katara and Sokka's sibling dynamic is endearing, with each character bringing their own strengths and vulnerabilities to the group dynamic. Zuko's redemption arc remains a highlight, as his internal struggles and external conflicts are depicted with emotional depth and complexity.Furthermore, the series explores themes of friendship, loyalty, and self-discovery with a deft touch, resonating with audiences of all ages. The world-building is rich and expansive, drawing viewers into a fantastical realm filled with ancient traditions, mystical creatures, and epic battles. Each episode unfolds like a chapter in an epic saga, keeping viewers eagerly anticipating what comes next.Despite its flaws, \"Avatar: The Last Airbender\" on Netflix in 2024 is a testament to the enduring legacy of the original series. It may not be a perfect adaptation, but it succeeds in capturing the spirit of the beloved animated show while introducing new elements to enthrall both longtime fans and newcomers alike. With its stunning visual effects and heartfelt storytelling, it earns a commendable 9 out of 10, proving itself as a worthy addition to the Avatar canon.","rating":"9\/10","date":"27 February 2024"}
{"title":"Netflix does it with this adaptation","review":"It's a wonderful remake and retelling of a timeless classic. Visually stunning. Amazing storytelling. And hits where it counts. Don't hesitate watching this. Go in open minded and you will enjoy it very much. It isn't 1:1 remake and that's okay. It tells all the stuff that matters without all the filler. Little more dark then Original which is great considering all the og fans are adults now. Really pleased with how it turned out and I think the second book which is considered the best book will be even better. I hope it gets made sooner then later so young aang doesn't age to much.

{"title":"Avatar Fans Should Really Give it a Try","review":"I actually watched this show for laughs, expecting it to be bad. All I've heard online were negative things. And they were wrong! The special effects are incredible, the fight scenes are beautifully shot\/choreographed, the dialogue is still fun & witty and bears a lot of similarity to the animated show in the best possible way, and the pacing varied in all the right ways - we hit the heavy moments and the fun moments and the sad moments beautifully. Avatar animation fans in particular will enjoy getting to see more of characters they didn't see interact as much in the animation, a number of interesting expansions to the lore that made sense to me. At the end of the day, you have to compare this new live-action series to one the greatest animated shows of all time...does it hold up? No, not even close, the animated avatar show is better. When the casting in the live-action lands, it really lands, and when it doesn't, it really hurts, and you feel it either way. The fire nation cast of characters in particular were pretty weak (excluding Zuko, his crew, and Commander Zhao, who had some absolute standout performances). The show also makes some pretty substantial rewrites to the original animation, likely to save on time and budget, and not all of the choices they made were great - King Bumi and Firelord Ozai in particular really fall flat - the casting for these roles was good! - The way they were written\/directed\/portrayed absolutely betrayed the purpose of their character in the narrative. The two weakest performances were that of Katara and General Iroh, Katara likely because of the writing\/directing (its hard to get a great performance out of a child actor), and BOTH Iroh's performance and writing really falls flat. Aang and Sokka really carry this show on their backs currently. I'd like to see Katara be a little more outspoken and playful, she was the mature one of the group and in this version she comes off as timid, bashful, and unsure of herself, which feels like a character betrayal (I get it, you're trying to add \"an arc\", but she has a different arc in the animated show that was better). Overall the show is incredibly strong, I hope there is a season 2 (which is why they got a high rating, I want more of this, honestly season 1 as stands is more like a 6 or 7), and I hope they take some of the feedback from season 1 to make a better season 2.","rating":"9\/10","date":"1 March 2024"}
{"title":"First review.. from a life-long OG ATLA fan","review":"I watched ATLA as a kid, when it first released. I was like 10-12. All that show has done since then is age like a fine wine. It's the perfect animated adventure that any person of any age can enjoy.It's obvious that a live action show cannot perfectly match the original. And obviously it's been 20 years, and things have changed and they're clearly wanting this to appeal to a broader age audience, I think with all those things considered..They did pretty good! Writing and acting could both be better, but 75-90% of it is plenty good enough, and it FEELS like avatar which to me, is what matters.What surprised me is that the majority of the \"intentional changes\" they made are actually not too bad. I have some problems with Katara in this in general, as well as Sokka's lack of any real humor, but buy and large they did good.Much better than I feared it would be, but still could have been more.8\/10 for avatar fans, 6\/10 for losers who never watched the original.","rating":"10\/10","date":"26 February 2024"}
{"title":"Better than the old one, significantly worse than the show.","review":"Avatar the Last Speedrun, arcs were combined from the show that makes it confusing and out of place for previous watches. The amount of exposition is insane to handhold you through the content. They relied so much on exposition that you realize that characters feel empty and hollow because their actors don't have the experience to carry the emotion through the expositions. Characters cry without any tears running down their face or wet eyes at all. Wardrobe looks like someone just bought a cosplay off of a rack versus it being weather torn or singed\/scorched. Finally, character personality traits change in the worst way. Katara has become the overly vanilla shell shocked girl while Suki has become a thirsty fangirl. Better than the last live action, far inferior to the show.","rating":"2\/10","date":"23 February 2024"}
{"title":"Don't listen to obsessed fans","review":"Listen, I was a 90's kid that fell in love with the original cartoon too but I'm not so obsessed with the source material to appreciate this well done ADAPTATION.The young characters def needed to warm up their acting skills in episode 1. But by episode 8 the characters were really starting to develop well. The series captures the youthful, naive, whimsical nature of the children as they quickly realize they have to take on some serious but important tasks.The visual effects couldn't have been done better which I don't think ATLAB fans will find fault. But don't listen to their banter of how \"it's not EXACTLY like the source material\". Get over it. This is amazing work. Looking forward to the seasons to come!","rating":"9\/10","date":"26 February 2024"}
{"title":"The best live action adaptation you will get","review":"First of all it looks like lot of people don't know the meaning of the word adaptation. Why would you want to make something exactly the same as the cartoon? You have the cartoon to watch for that.You can tell espacialy after watching it a second time, that this series is made with true passion for the original in a more realistic emotional way. And now I could even watch it directly for a third time.I see lot of similar things in the bad reviews, like some of the acting, that 8 episode are too less, ...etc. And I agree mostly with those things. But I also see a lot of hate that is just hate and nothing more. Does anyone really know how hard it is to go from a cartoon format to a live action format?In a cartoon time goes faster, so you can do more in shorter time. You also have unrealistic elements in a cartoon that probably will never work in live action.I also wanted more momo and appa, or just longer time to connect with the characters. I think the biggest dealbreaker is that they had only 8 episodes to tell the story.With that said I think they did a pretty damm good job. I really loved the beginning of the series, the adding of things we did not see in the original cartoon series, some changes like the 41 division and that from the lost spirit monster to make it impactfulller etc.And remember, the original creators were apart of the 2010 disaster movie as executive producers so I don't think it is right to use this as an argument why it is so called \"bad\". And yes I also know the original creators did not write the story of the 2010 movie and that they have written for this show's first season before they left.This is the best live action adaptation you will ever get of this series, so hate it and go watch the cartoon. Or, love it with an open mind, like me ;)","rating":"10\/10","date":"25 February 2024"}
{"title":"Great adaptation","review":"First off this is the live action that should have been made initially, it did not stray from the original. The format and storyline fits being a live action vice a cartoon. You can actually get more emotion from the events especially when LT Jee and the 41st find out that it was zuko who saved their lives, I know a lot of people will hate it because it's not exactly like the cartoon but that will be regurgitating the original content. They made the story line fit together and compacts several episodes into one which was very unique and it worked for me. The casting is amazing, the only thing is bumi not what I was expecting not as loving as the cartoon to aang and azula but I'm foreseeing that her character arc will build she still does not have blue flames yet if she actually is, zuko and Sokka, Ozai and iroh are amazing portrayals. Great job and I hope Amazon doesn't cancel it like they did the dark crystal.","rating":"10\/10","date":"24 February 2024"}
{"title":"Decent and Fine!","review":"Probably a good series to watch if you just want to explore a new world like this story, kinda rushed than the original but i like it everything i have nothing to say this adaptation is fair enough to amaze me not to get bored... it may be good for the people who didn't watch the original but idk to the people who are fan or admiring the show but for me its a decent series i never get bored watching it i might get dislike by this but somehow i like it its better than the previous adaptation more details characters added the problem is the story pacing and some good cgi but it will be improve maybe later or smth but anyways its good not bad or boring like any adaptation i see.","rating":"8\/10","date":"22 February 2024"}
{"title":"I am laughing","review":"Laughing at the people who are saying that the negative reviews are because we \"don't like the cartoon.\" No, you sheep. The negative reviews (or at least mine) are because:1) The acting is as wooden as a chair. This is most notably present in Sokka, who is absolutely stiff, humorless, and very rarely exhibits any emotions. Even Aang. He finds out that his people have been wiped out and he... kind of brushes it off. Really?2) On top of that, it has the same problem that the movie has: Constant expositing and it often repeats itself. The first episode repeats the same intro monologue two or three times. WE GET IT! And instead of Aang discovering the truth about the war, his past, etc. On his own, we get... Gran Gran and\/or Katara explaining it to him. Because why would we want a character going through a journey when we could have an old woman and a little girl he hardly knows explain it all to him? That is called info-dumping, and I do not appreciate it.3) Now, here's where the show comparisons come in. If it doesn't want to be like the show, that's fine. But make a decision and STICK TO IT. There are times when it would deviate, but then other times it would directly copy the show word for word. So which do you want?And I promise, I did try to have an open mind about this. I'll admit, I was skeptical from the beginning, and there are positive things to say about the show. For instance:The effects. SO MUCH BETTER than the movie. I realize that's not saying much, but I was caught off guard by some of the things we see. Especially seeing Sozin grab a guy's hand and light him on fire. That was... surprising and disturbing.Iroh's actor was... fine. But honestly, I find him a difficult character to screw up and an impossible one to recreate. So, I got what I expected from him. One more positive thing I can appreciate was Gyatso's line: \"The Comet Festival was 100 years ago, and no I'm not old enough to remember it.\" Or, something to that effect.So yeah, some people are fanboys who hate anything different. But some of us have legitimate problems with the show. If your only argument is \"WeLL yOU jUsT haTE thINGS thAt aRE diFFrENT!\" sit down and shut up. I'm not going to apologize because I'm not a mindless consumer of pointless corporate garbage.","rating":"4\/10","date":"23 February 2024"}
{"title":"Great attempt at a live action show","review":"Doing a live action show can be gard to adapt especially from an animation.While Avatar has its teething problems I believe it is a great show which brings back nostalgia from the original show.Comparing it to the disaster of the live action movie will be comparing day and night. (In this case the Netflix adaptation is Day)I truly hope Netflix pulls this series through to the end, it s has the potential to be a great show and I believe that it may live up to the original. The cast can slightly improve their acting however the cast selection is fantastic in representing the nations.A great show to watch !","rating":"9\/10","date":"22 February 2024"}
{"title":"What an adaptation should be.","review":"I am such a huge fan of the original show that I have an avatar tattoo, I am pursuing a career in animation so I can hopefully make a cartoon like Avatar someday, and I held the #1 spot on Trivia Crack for Avatar in the state of Texas for months. And as a fan of the animated show, and a filmmaker: I loved this series.They remained immensely faithful to the characters and had PERFECT Marvel-level casting. It took all the main story beats of the show and explored them in ways we didn't see in the original series, hitting emotional beats even harder while remaining faithful to the spirit of the original. And the visuals were everything I've ever wanted to see.They didn't copy the show exactly, because who wants that? They'd never measure up to the original show. But they made something new that celebrated the original series (and even drew from the lore in the comics and books). It was a love letter to true diehard fans like me.But if you go in with your mind already set against it, what show could possibly be enjoyable to you? If you're one of these people, you're doing nobody a favor by ruining the reception of this show by leaving bad reviews based more in your bad attitude than the amazing show itself.Is it perfect? No, there were a couple of scenes where the cgi was weird, the acting at the beginning might be a bit awkward at the beginning, and Bumi's portrayal was mid. But those are very nitpicky things that I was able to forgive because the good FAR outweighs the bad. Please don't stop this beautiful adaptation from getting renewed and introducing us to Toph.","rating":"10\/10","date":"26 February 2024"}
{"title":"A Genuine Attempt to recapture the magic","review":"This show is unique a bar too low that anyone can surpass and a bar to high that one can only wish to succeed, this show is the middle child.There are some moments that are better than THE ORIGINAL (YES !!!) and some makes u cringe. But overall I believe this is an work of art don't compare it with the original just watch it as a fan not a purist and overall its a Solid 9. Coming to the caste my favorite is Sokka and this one descripts Sokka better than the original, Aang and Zuko are perfect, talking against Uncle Iroh is a blasphemy the actress of Katara shines in the second half . I hope the creators improve the dialogues for season 2 and 3.","rating":"8\/10","date":"24 February 2024"}
{"title":"amazing","review":"It was really interesting to me, especially the special effects and script, but unfortunately the actors acted artificially, the soundtrack of the series was wonderful, the actor of Avatar Kiyoshi was wonderful, the actor Zuko looks like a child, it could have been better, the choice of actors It wasn't done right, but it had an interesting story, I can't wait for the second season, I would like to add one point, some of the story has been changed and this is interesting to me because in the series Eng meets Avatar Kiyoshi, but in the anime Avatar it was Roku, this change was interesting and good.","rating":"10\/10","date":"22 February 2024"}
{"title":"Bad dialogue and awful directing","review":"The visuals are fantastic on this series and decent humour with Sokka with well choreographed fight scenes. However, they've completely destroyed the opportunity for character development and good story telling. They've tried put so much of the animated 3 season story into season 1 and so early that it comes across as a desperate attempt to gain interest for a 2nd season. The more emotional scenes don't have the context of the character development and they've sped through parts of the dialogue, so it doesn't hold the weight that it should. They've completely missed the mark with the Directing and added in characters WAY too early.","rating":"3\/10","date":"26 February 2024"}
{"title":"Ignore the critics","review":"Most of the criticism for this series comes from those who expect the original animation to be remade frame-for-frame in live action.In reality, Avatar's live action series is sympathetic to the original, but not a carbon copy (if you want to watch the original, I don't understand why you wouldn't just go and watch the original?). The casting is (almost) perfect, the characters are developed and evoke emotion, the costumes strike a perfect balance between authentic and interesting... I find it VERY difficult to fault this series.If you expected a direct copy of the original, go and watch that instead. You'd be missing out on a love letter TO the original though if you did.","rating":"10\/10","date":"1 March 2024"}
{"title":"Not The Original But Charming","review":"So Netflix seems to be keeping this true enough to the source to keep original fans through to the end of the season, but it's clear that the goal here is to cast a huge net and catch a whole lot of new fans of Avatar: The Last Airbender.There is a lot of exposition and there are additions to the original that make it more real than what a kid's show would portray like the gravity of war and loss and grief and the burden of responsibility. These had more weight than the cartoon showed.The most redeeming factor to me was how emotionally charged this was. There were moments where I could really feel like this meant something to the creators and actors of the show. Sure, there were some wooden scenes and acting, but there were more moments that shined through with so much charm and emotion and depth that far outweigh the other parts.Also, the actors who played Aang, Katara, Sokka, Zuko, and Uncle Iroh were spot on!","rating":"8\/10","date":"25 February 2024"}
{"title":"Faithful adaptation, great VFX, mediocre direction and acting","review":"Note: this is just for 3 episodes in.Pros:This show has better VFX than it deserves to have. From the very detailed CGI backgrounds to bending effects themselves, it's top notch at least for TV format.Fans of the original will recognize almost nearly all the characters, story arcs, even certain scenes and internal jokes. There's little to none interpretation here, their goal is to make this as accurate to the original in a new format as possible.The casting has been excellent at least in terms of making them look like the original characters. I like the varied Asian races representing each of the elemental tribes\/nations. The actors seem to make believable motions while bending, and some appear straight-up proficient in martial arts.The Kyoshi scene was incredible!Cons:The child actors, with some exceptions, are not great when it comes to the actual acting. It's a lot to ask that they have accurate looks to the show while also needing to have some martial arts training and being able to act well at such young ages. But I guess in the end they still act like children, which is what you would expect. But some stand-out acting from Zuko makes me wish it applied to the others as well.The direction of most of the non-action scenes seems bland, static, and lots of setting up the story as opposed to developing the characters. It'll probably be better as the show goes on, however.Some other notes:it's been complained about that the clothes are too clean. I kind of agree, but I think you get used to it after awhile. But it would have been cool to see what it would look like if the clothes were more worn-down, almost like if you've been traveling for weeks with a single set of clothes.","rating":"8\/10","date":"25 February 2024"}
{"title":"Just watch it and have an open mind!","review":"As someone who loves the original show and watched it as it came out. I was really surprised with this show in a good and bad way in first time watching. Bad because they changed some of the characters personalities and mashed bunch of storylines together but in the end I enjoyed it because by the end is its own show and story. This show is more realistic as in if it would happen in real life. What would you feel and react if you were put in that situation. And the main cast, people complain that they're either too stiff or acting in general are bad, but you have to realize their just kids and brand new so give them time maybe is the directors fault but still they did pretty great. Not every kid actor do great in their first big show or movie. I can separate opinion between the original and life action! Except for the atrocity of that movie that must not be named. But this show has the spirit of the original and even the changes makes sense in the life action one. And if I ever want to watch the original I'll just watch the original it still exist. I hope there's a season 2!","rating":"9\/10","date":"26 February 2024"}
{"title":"Poor writing and acting overshadow the good","review":"Many positive reviews mention fans of the animation series having unrealistic shot for shot expectations as if that's the reason for so many poor reviews. This misses the mark entirely.The biggest issue holding the live action back is the frenetic pacing and exposition, combined with weak main character performances, specifically the Aang and Katara actors. The animation was able to bring to life multifaceted and flawed characters who grow in various ways throughout the series. The live action completely misses the mark here. Aang is solemn and melodramatic, completely lacking joy and fun. Katara is meek and feeble without ANY emotion. The writing is much to blame. The relentless plot advancement and tendency to \"tell\" instead of \"show\" doesn't help. But even so, these actors don't seem able to able to act the required range anyways.Og fans love the animated series because of the incredible character development. With that missing, it's simply impossible to get emotionally invested in what's portrayed. Visuals and CGI is great for the most part. If you are a fan of spectacle than I can see you enjoying this show. However, if you're looking for more than beautiful sets and fight scenes you will be sorely disappointed.It's clear everyone involved deeply loved the source material and their effort is commendable. I do hope the series is renewed for another couple seasons. That said, Season 2 would benefit from slowing down the plot advancement pace by only tackling half the animated series book 2 with focus on giving longer dialogue scenes where we can become more emotionally invested in the characters.","rating":"4\/10","date":"24 February 2024"}
{"title":"Pretty good but could've been better","review":"After completing the series and disclosing that I went into this show with very low expectations, I will say pretty happy with the finished product, felt that the show did a good job of paying homage to the original story in a lot of different ways, but with as many great parts of it, there were also some bad. To start episode 3 combines the actual omashu episode as well as the jet episode with the northern air temple episode, I understand the need for shortening this but these are three drastically different times u are putting in one episode. Another major issue was the gross use of the cave of two lovers which isn't actually supposed to be till season 2. Despite those two major issues I had with it, I very much enjoyed the costumes, (most of the acting) and the first two and last two episodes I actually thought were phenomenal, 3 and 4 is where I had my biggest issues but still would recommend true fans give it a watch. I've seen this original show more times than I can count and could probably recite the history of this show better than I could US history haha. Overall not perfect, just pretty good. 8\/10.","rating":"8\/10","date":"23 February 2024"}

Binged it in 1 day","review":"As someone who hasn't watched that much of the original animated series, this show is so amazing at bringing these characters to life right from the first episode I was hooked and anticipating more. I know there are people out there that won't even watch the animated series because for the fact that it's animated. But now those same people are able to watch this show and get involved in these characters and story's. I finished the last episode wanting more and can't wait for season 2 to continue the story.

{"title":"I am a HUGE fan of the original","review":"I am a HUGE fan of the original series. I was expecting a total live action remake of the original series and this is definitely jumping around the storyline a lot which is taking some getting used to. I think that the casting was very well done other than Azula I feel like she could have had some more grit. I'm impressed with how well done Apa and Momo were created as they have always been a couple of my favorites! Just like the original series I have been brought laughter, tears and suspense which is amazing. Overall I think this is an incredible show with amazing team of actors, writers and producers.","rating":"10\/10","date":"26 February 2024"}
{"title":"cutting some storylines is only natural","review":"Not that I'm not disappointed in how the direction the show has taken by changing the original story and cutting some off completely, I understand it is only because of the limitations the show runner and producers hadit should be reminded to all viewers that this is not a replacement nor an expansion for the original show. It is merely a remake that would normally differ in various waysI think this show is worth watching for everyone, fans included. Let's not put aside how visually pleasing it is. A sight for sore eyes, without any exaggeration. I am very excited to see how book 2 and 3 will be portrayed, which will contain many more epic events and magnificent locations to behold.Let's give this a chance. Worst case scenario, this show will be forgotten like the movie. However I highly doubt that.","rating":"10\/10","date":"26 February 2024"}
{"title":"This is just not the same","review":"This is a completely different story. Everything is difficult. Every character is different. Aang is not aang, bumi is not bumi. They could not get a single character right. They even destroyed my favourite uncle Iroh. Sokka's arc is ruined. Don't renew it for a new season. Please. The story is rushed and all the steps are combined. The humor is lost. The journey is not the same. There are no character relationship builds. The creators did not get the gist of anime. Make longer or more episodes but give us what the anime was and not a completely different story with same characters. Very disappointing.","rating":"3\/10","date":"23 February 2024"}
{"title":"Very well done","review":"First, if you haven't seen the original anime series, don't worry about it, the story is well done, and most of the critical elements are here. I think it still holds up as an excellent story with complex characters.I watched it with someone who didn't know the original story, and they really enjoyed the reveal of the complex backstory on most of the characters. Some characters feel clear-cut at the beginning, but their story arc, even within the first season, is quite complex. The actors and actresses, I felt, did an excellent job, and really did capture the original characters quite well. It is absolutely worth watching!Second, if you have seen the original anime series, then you have to realize that the original first season was 20 episodes, and those were compressed into only 8 for this series. Netflix is very stingy with their series. They do a small number of episodes and very few seasons. So any reviews about how they left out this or that, they glossed over this other thing, they should have spent more time on something, or about how Netflix should have broken the story down into more episodes, etc., are all really missing the point. Netflix has not, and will never, make a 20 episode series, so our choice was 8 episodes for season 1, or nothing.Given that, they did a very good job of capturing the key points of the story. Nothing significant was left out. So, I'll agree with the low scoring reviews that some of the more minor characters look slightly different (so what?!), and some of the minor story lines (mostly just Aang goofing around) were cut; I would have liked to see Appa more, and I would have enjoyed more time on some of the stories.But what we got was VERY good.","rating":"9\/10","date":"26 February 2024"}
{"title":"Love it coming from a long time Fan","review":"Don't understand the hate, but this is an awesome adaptation. I watch the show when I younger and this definitely does the show justice. Granted it not the same cause live action there has to make things work. Which mean some changes and it nice to have some changes . Casting is awesome..I watch 4 episode already and loving it. I'll rewatch it again. So if anyone want it to be exactly like the anime, then they should just watch the anime. This live adaptation to be is almost the same as the anime. I would say love this more than cause It gear more toward fans that watch the show in the you age and now are more adult. Which mean they have to changes..but in a good way. It not perfect but I enjoyed.","rating":"10\/10","date":"23 February 2024"}
{"title":"Very good","review":"It was good point blank.yes it wasn't exactly like the original but it was good on its own and that's enough. The visuals were good, most of the casting was spot on, costuming and world creating was good. Some dialogue maybe wasn't the best but all shows experience some of that. The bending was amazing, the action was amazing, the plot build up was amazing. I cried quite a bit surprisingly and especially when they did reference to the original it brought tears to my eyes. I honestly felt suspense the entire time even tho I knew what was gonna happen. And the very last seen and the last battle had me feeling irritated and wanting to jump in and stop all the fighting.","rating":"10\/10","date":"1 March 2024"}
{"title":"A really good adaptation (not a remake) but the dialogues can use some work","review":"The scenes are beautiful, and I loved the way the cities, streets and villages were setup. It added more character to the set. I also loved the way that extra content from the comics and rest of the canon was added. There was also new content to provide more depth to characters that was not explored in the original, and in my opinion that was done well. But the dialogues at times felt really cheesy. Same with the dialogues which were there for exposition, they felt forced or unnatural. Also most of the cast acted really well except for a few, but I believe they will be able to smoothen out the rough edges. Overall, it was a really good watch.","rating":"9\/10","date":"23 February 2024"}
{"title":"Please, just please leave the old legends alone","review":"To begin with, as a huge fan of the original series I didn't have high expectations. However, even without expectations it was unbearable to watch.Compared to the Shyamalan movie (which most of the real fans pretend that doesn't exist), it is way better. Combat scenes, the visual effects were on point. I enjoyed the realistic and slightly violent combat. That was the only thing I have to say I enjoyed.I binge watched the whole series and felt very uncomfortable as the character development was very weak and as an audience it was hard to connect with the characters- which in my opinion is what distinguished the original series from any other show ever created in the first place. It is okay to change the plot and sequence of events if you are doing a live action but without the character development amd original sincerity that the fans are looking for, you are doomed to fail.This is for the producers, Avatar TLA universe is very vast and you can mine amazing stories from this universe - eg. The Legend of Korra. Do something different, like produce something about Avatar Roku's or Kyoshi's life, or tell us the story of post-war, Republic City etc. Just accept the fact that you can't do better than the original series and people will always be prejudiced.","rating":"2\/10","date":"22 February 2024"}
{"title":"Live action done right.","review":"Rarely does a live adaptation live up to its predecessor. With great attention to detail They really nailed it this time. If they were to write new seasons beyond the original script I think that could really work here. All the characters are spot on from looks to speech, and most importantly emotion. Avatar was always about an underlying message. They were able to capture all the \"elements\" of the show and retell the story with spot on accuracy. I would have never thought that this show could transition to live action so flawlessly. I hope Netflix continues to go this route with an future live action venture.","rating":"9\/10","date":"29 February 2024"}
{"title":"I enjoyed it","review":"I liked the first season. I used to be a big fan of the animated series, but I watched it about 6 years ago, so I don't remember the events of the first season in much detail. Now, watching this live-action adaptation, I didn't feel any negativity. For the most part, the characters were preserved, and the story was dynamic.I liked the graphics. The animals were just amazing. I especially want to mention the characters Iroh, Zuko, and Aang. I really enjoyed these characters. In my opinion, they could have added a bit more humor to Sokka's character, and the appearance of the actress playing Azula doesn't quite match. But, I'm eagerly looking forward to the second season. Thanks.","rating":"10\/10","date":"27 February 2024"}
{"title":"Great adaptation of the anime!","review":"I found this adaptation of the Avatar: The Last Airbender great. Although they took some liberties in the first season, I found it still very close to the original show. The very visual effects were great, the story was good, but there were some parts that could have been a bit better. I found that they did a great job on Zuko's character and his development throughout the series. Aang's character wasn't 100% true to his anime character but I believe if the series continues his goofy, silly traits will come alive. Same with Katara and Sokka character developments. Overall I absolutely loved this series and hope that Netflix picks it up for both season 2 and 3.","rating":"10\/10","date":"3 March 2024"}
{"title":"Unbelievable. Must watch","review":"I came into this with such low expectations, but thought maybe there was hope. Come to find it insanely amazing. I'm utterly shocked. I can't believe that they were able to to get the bending to look so realistic. There are definitely parts that are a little rushed but I'm only two episodes in and I'm in complete disbelief and getting goosebumps. I've watched the original show a lot and didn't think anything would compare but this blows the cake out of the water. I hate to even critique anything, but I do think that the characters could have been casted better but aside from that the time that went into this has to be a lot.","rating":"10\/10","date":"2 March 2024"}
{"title":"Don't bother watching","review":"I had high hopes for this, but unfortunately, it turned to be horrible for several reasons - these are two main reasons:1. The performances come off as artificial, with characters displaying either excessive or insufficient emotions. The acting feels subpar.2. Not only has the story been altered, but it's been twisted in an unfavorable manner. The changes not only disrupt the storyline but also erode the coherence and flow of events that were well-executed in the original series.While the CGI is impressive, it's disheartening to see such a significant investment of money and effort undermined by a lackluster storyline and poor character portrayal. Despite having talented actors and actresses, their performances in this show leave much to be desired.","rating":"1\/10","date":"24 February 2024"}
{"title":"A solid re adaptation, not a page to page copy as the original one, which is nice","review":"People all over are not giving the show any chance, expecting it to be the exact same as the animated show. Which cannot be the case because live action needs months of CGI work and we cannot have the same number of episodes. For me the art direction and bending CGI were top of the line, pacing could have been slightly better. In all a top show, can't wait for season two.Casting was on point, Azula was brilliant, Katara was great, but did not feel much like the original katara. And the world design, especially the city of Om-Shu was brilliant. Can't wait to see how Ba Sing Se looks like in the next season.","rating":"9\/10","date":"26 February 2024"}
{"title":"Season one is good, not great. But neither is the animation.","review":"The first season of the animation and the live action adaptation are not a 10\/10 in my opinion. Maybe a 7\/10 at best. Still I would call the animation series close to perfection any day.The live action is good, not great. But I really think the show deserves a second and third season because there is where the story really shines.I don't mind season one not being perfect if the writers evolve and learn from it. But fans can be ruthless when it comes to their favorite show and I fear the critique is going to cause the show not to have a second season at all. Like a three-headed rat viper, we poison ourselves as we watch our enemy go down.Ps: Dallas Lui as Zuko is perfection.","rating":"10\/10","date":"23 February 2024"}
{"title":"Justice to the original while forging a new path","review":"This show has managed to do the impossible by binging one of the most creative and engaging animated stories to life, a feat that has taken 20 years to achieve and for my money, it doesn't get better than this. As a long time fan of the cartoon, I grew up with this show so my expectations were set way above the roof, but this has exceeded them. It both feels fresh and reminiscent in the best ways of a show I know and love, it's clear the people behind it have a passion and love for the world of avatar which is so sorely needed when translating it over to the real world.The cast is literally perfect, they each bring their characters to life in a way that makes an O. G. fans heart sing. Dallas Liu brings so much emotion to his Prince Zuko that I got emotional more times than I was expecting, and the juxtaposition between him pre and post scar was a real highlight of the series. Each actor gets their moment to shine and the audience gets to find out more about who the characters really are. And the additions that have been made only deepen your understanding of them.The writing did a great job in weaving together all the important plot points while still making it a cohesive story that both keeps it fresh but doesn't leave out the small details that hard core fans would recognise. The new scenes are something that usually doesn't work in remakes or retellings as you can usually tell the difference between the writing quality, but the writers clearly have an understanding of who these characters are and what we need to see of them to understand that. These changes don't erase the original show either and help keep it fresh for the old fans as in some episodes you really don't know what's going to happen. By the end of the series I was bouncing with anticipation for the follow up, Book 2.","rating":"8\/10","date":"23 February 2024"}
{"title":"Hopes set so high that now I'm crying myself to sleep","review":"The visuals are incredible. So much better then the then the previous film but my god is the script awful. The only thing worse are the actors who are in no relationship to each other, have such low stakes, feel bland, and not unique from one another, and are just terrible. In that regard it is very much similar to the film version. Even the veteran actors are pretty bad in this, so perhaps it's the script that needs the most work. In summation It's lost all humor from the cartoon, the acting is horrendously bad, and because of that, I did not buy the story for a second. Now I will go cry some more.","rating":"3\/10","date":"23 February 2024"}
{"title":"Awesome awesome awesome awesome","review":"I have always been a die-hard fan of the Avatar series and how they executed this whole chapter is applaudable. Hats off to whole team behind the scenes specially the aftereffects team. To animate the air bending, for me, is the hardest part as air actually has no form but to show it so naturally is showing how dedicated everyone was in creating this master piece. I dont know why people are comparing it to original animated series because it is so obvious that if the animated series is to be copied as it is then who would watch such obvious series. So for me, the slight modification in the series is the plus point. Looking forward to remaining chapters and i do hope they also move to korra's character in the future as well. I cant stop to wait for the release of next book. Very very very excited.","rating":"10\/10","date":"28 February 2024"}
{"title":"A Nostalgic Journey Back to the Elements","review":"As someone who grew up loving the animated adventures of Aang, Katara, Sokka, Toph and Zuko, I was both excited and nervous when Netflix announced a live-action version of \"Avatar: The Last Airbender\". Would it capture the same wonder Here's my take:1. Casting Heroes:Aang, our fun-loving Avatar, is played by Gordon. He's got the same spirit and image as the animated Aang-curious, kind, and ready to save the world.Zuko, with his scar and inner struggle, is portrayed by Dallas. We feel his pain and hope for his redemption.The whole gang-Aang, Katara, Sokka, Zuko and hoping for toph.2. Bending Magic:When they bend elements-fire, earth, or water-it's like watching real-life superheroes. The effects are cool!The sets-the icy Southern Water Tribe, the grand Fire Nation palace-make us feel part of their world.3. Plot Twists and Turns:Yes, there are changes from the animated show. Some stories are shorter, and surprises pop up.But that's okay! It's like a remix of our favorite song-it feels familiar yet fresh.4. Heartfelt Moments:Remember Uncle Iroh:s wisdom? It's here. And Appa and Momo? Yep, they're adorable.When Aang faces his destiny or Zuko confronts his past, we feel it too.5. Respecting the Original:The creators honor the animated series while adding their touch. It's like a love letter to fans.Hoping for more seasons we want more bending, and I want to see toph.In summary, this live-action journey is like finding a hidden treasure chest-it's not exactly the same, but the gems inside still shine.","rating":"10\/10","date":"27 February 2024"}
{"title":"Truly Remarkable with Stunning Visuals","review":"I cannot say enough how absolutely FLOORED I was by this live-action make.Let's start with the criticisms others have; Firstly, you CANNOT recreate the experience of the original cartoon because there are certain things in animation that cannot carry-over into the real world, similar to the Cartoon Network show Teen Titans. Secondly, the actors are just kids, but they do a dang good job, similar to Tom Holland as Spider-Man, so cut them some slack. Despite their lack of experience, none of their scenes were cringeworthy. Some don't like Azula's youthful, girlish appearance, but I think that was intentional as it shows how everyone underestimates her, forcing her acting to bear the burden of the character.I give this show a 9\/10 only because of Princess Yue's bad wig. Other than that, this show was EVERYTHING I could've asked for as a fan of the show. I cried, I laughed, and my jaw dropped COUNTLESS time as I watched the amazing fight\/war\/death scenes. I cannot wait for Book 2, for Toph, and for the sinking library! I hope they do a Korra season, and I'd love to see interpretations of other avatars! Is this show perfect? No. But is it good? YES, and a million times better than the studio cash-grab excuse of a movie from M. Night Shyamalan. Watch it for what it is, and don't hold it to the standard of your memory of the cartoon.","rating":"9\/10","date":"26 February 2024"}

{"title":"Netflix should not release any other series based off animations again","review":"Netflix is a great production company but when it comes to storytelling they always fail. From the cast choices to the CGI effects everything seems right but, when it comes to the story it fails. I enjoy the little extra details that link the story together but the story itself was perfect and made sequential sense to the viewer. Each episode is almost an hour and still many important moments are left out. It is worth mentioning that these moments are important for the viewer to create a connection with the characters.

{"title":"Flawed, but still eminently enjoyable","review":"Objectively? It's probably a 6 or 7 out of 10. Many moments in the later half of the season feel quite rushed. Some of the acting falls flat. Some of the character decisions are questionable to say the least.Emotionally? Solid 9 out of 10. I very much enjoyed it. I was bouncing up and down in my seat at many parts of it. There are many parts of it I liked just as much if not better than the original. Some of the things they did with the Fire Nation in particular I'm really excited to see play out in later seasons. And unpopular opinion, I actually liked the darker grittier tone over the goofier slapstick of the original. The callbacks to the original could definitely be a little jarring\/feel a little stilted for people who haven't seen the animated version, but for someone who has seen it I absolutely loved them.Definitely worth watching.

{"title":"Worthwhile adaption requiring the next seasons","review":"Netflix had quite the task ahead of themselves. Firstly, they had to cut short the 20 episodes of the original book 1 content into only 8 in the live adaption. They had to portray core relationships and connections very very quickly. And each of the main characters needed to stay true to some of the key traits of the original series. I think this series does a fantastic job at doing that. Don't rewatch the cartoon beforehand and go into it as if it's fresh, it does a great job at getting the main elements across. Epic sets, epic VFX and stellar carrying of all actors. I desperately hope s2 gets the go ahead. Ignorw the changeover effect of M Knight Shyamalan - this is a worthwhile watch.","rating":"10\/10","date":"25 February 2024"}
{"title":"For a remake it's pretty good","review":"I like that by doing the live action series they didn't miss as many little details us fans enjoy like the flop of the live action film did. Yes there were some things missing compared to the original or some storylines got blended to still tell but not in the same way as the original told them, but I thought it was clever how they combined them and made it work.They would never budget a pilot project for as many episodes as the original to keep the storyline the exact same and to include the level of detail they have, so it would be ridiculous to have that expectation.

Zukos actor did a great job, capturing the pain anger and urgency required within the character. It was also so meaningful to see Asian and indigenous actors represent an on screen and in the fantasy genre. The bending was significantly better than the movie, and although nothing can live up to the original, I was still completely enthralled.

I hope they continue it \uf8ff\u00fc\u00f4\u00e8\uf8ff\u00fc\u00e8\u00ba, but draw it out more than they did this first eight episodes.

And seriously where did they find all these lookalike actors... they should get an award for only this.Also the story, its is going with a flow, its soooo fun to watch, I watched all episodes in one row! - the only thing what I didnt like was a bit the love stories, jumping for episode to episode with all these flirts was a bit much. Its a different feeling if you watchthe 20 episodes of the animation.

{"title":"The Best Adaptation Fans Could Hope For - Bravo Netflix!","review":"I cancelled my Netflix subscription over a year ago because, at that time, there was no programming on the service that I was interested in. I re-subscribed specifically to watch this series and I am glad I did. After watching all of Season One, I went back to watch the entire original animated series and was amazed at how faithful the Netflix production was to the original. Many critics seem not to understand the challenges in adapting animation to live-action. Testimony to this is the fact that most attempts have been abysmal failures. The challenge is exponentially more daunting when the original is universally beloved and widely considered one of the best animated series ever. In my opinion, this is the best live-action adaptation that could be hoped for. Critics have nit-picked it ad infinitum but it stands on its merits which I will detail below.Casting is excellent. Cordon Cormier is happy-go-lucky Aang. Not as overtly goofy as animated Aang, but every bit as sweetly innocent. He has more moments of serious introspection, but that only serves to literally flesh out his character. Ian Ousley is inspired casting as Sokka. He nails the character's appearance, personality, and distinctive voice. Dallas Liu is similarly impressive as tortured and driven Zuko. I hope for more seasons to watch Zuko complete his arc that we all know is his destiny. I could praise the rest of the cast equally. Suffice to say, all the characters we loved and loved to hate are here, and all are faithful to their original incarnations.Costuming and makeup is outstanding. Great care was obviously taken to ensure every character looks as if they stepped out of the Nickelodeon series.Effects are fantastic. The bending effects look great, and the creature effects are equally impressive. Live-action Appa and Momo are so well rendered, I was wishing they had more screen time.Fans will criticize every change and omission, but these changes, while absolutely necessary to any live-action adaptation, seem to have been made with great consideration and reverence for the original series. The producers were obviously fans of the original and it shows. Proof of this is their inclusion of The Cabbage Guy, a character who has zero practical impact on the story, but who is as beloved as any of the others.One bit of canon that will have to be loosely interpreted is the timeframe of the entire story arc and the aging of the characters. In the original, the entire story takes place in one year, the culmination of which is the reappearance of Sozin's Comet. In this adaptation, the date of this event is purposely kept vague. The reasoning for this is obvious - animated characters don't age, live actors do. Twelve-year-old boys have a habit of sprouting quickly and any Season Two production is likely to feature an Aang as tall as Sokka - perhaps even taller (!) In the featurette of the cast being interviewed, Gordon Cormier's voice has already noticably changed. It is likely that the one-year adventure of the Nickelodeon series will have to be revised into a three-year quest.In summary, this series is well made and thoroughly enjoyable. Production values are top-notch, and casting is fantastic. If there had never been an original series to compare it to, I am convinced that reviews would be effusive in praise for the production and everyone would be clamoring for Season Two. Considering it is currently #2 on Netflix, I'd be willing to bet we will get to see it eventually.","rating":"9\/10","date":"8 March 2024"}
{"title":"Terrible casting, awful character development, and bad story telling","review":"If you have not seen the animated series, you clearly feel something is wrong with the way story is going on. It looks too much straight, leaves no room for curiosity and thinking. No twists and no big events. Yes, big events happen but the audience may not feel them that way. That is because the characters are played badly and music is terrible. I mean at the end of the season one, in one of the most epic scenes there is no music and feels like some ordinary accident is going on. The cast is terrible as well. I mean it seems like they have been forced to make it with those actresses and actors. Especially the actress playing princess of the fire nation is unbelievably awful in every aspect. The avatar is next and then with a little distance come others like Zuko and The Uncle. These bad feedbacks get amplified if you have seen the original animated series. The funny moments of Avatar as a sweet child, the complex Character of the Uncle Iroh, and the wicked but bright and proud princes Azula. Even minor Characters are quite terrible. The only good casts in the show are Commander Zhao and Gyatso.Overall, there is only some good computer work and cinematography. I hope they totally recast the series and focus on the writing more than CGI for next season. Otherwise, this is already a failure.These for stars are for the story itself which is still quite interesting even that it has been told badly.","rating":"4\/10","date":"27 February 2024"}
{"title":"Adapting a Masterpiece of 20 Episodes into 8","review":"I can't say enough about how absolutely genuine, earnest, and enjoyable this adaptation is. You can tell that Netflix did NOT want to disappoint and that the creators were careful with this beloved show and its characters. I believe, even with the original creators bouncing from the project, Netflix still wanted to do them justice. They were never going to be able to make it perfect. It already was. Rarely are expectations so high, and the chance for failure so probable, and yet they still did it, and boy did they go for it. And how many of us turned on episode 1 knowing lighting can't strict twice? Yes, it will not be Aang's exact same character arc, nor Sakka's, but an arc is still there for both. Zuko's arc is even better than in the animated show (hot take there), and Katara's is intact. Iroh is phenomenal, and so is Ozai. I believe they did what they set out to do, and a 7.0-7.5 rating, with as many of us watching it, is enough to justify seasons 2 and 3 (I can't WAIT to meet Toph!) and hopefully Korra after that. A fun trick to enjoy beloved masterpiece remakes more these days (as we will inevitably be getting more) is to learn to engage with them without any expectations. Not low expectations or heaven forbid high expectations, just no expectations. And then sit back and enjoy. I find it helps a ton \uf8ff\u00fc\u00a7\u00a3","rating":"10\/10","date":"29 February 2024"}
{"title":"Too much compression, getting too dark for no reason, and changing characters and storylines to the detriment of the overall story.","review":"The Netflix series has just 8 episodes to 20 for the original, but with an hour or nearly an hour that would translate to 15-16 episodes worth of time in comparison. There shouldn't so much compression and combining storylines for apparently no reason. In just 4 episodes they have basically completely omitted half a dozen episodes, some are important to character development. They also needlessly change characters. Bumi is almost completely different and is a major problem for the future because his original character was important to the storyline and Aang's character development. Now that won't happen or happen properly along with basically all the trials of that episode to develop the Gaang won't happen either. Another example is that the love cave is combined into the Omashu episode in episode 4 but Aang isn't even there. That's incredibly important for character development for both Aang and Katara which doesn't happen now.Other things that are needlessly omitted are that Aang isn't the innocent kid who needed to grow up both as the avatar and as a person. He already has a warrior kid type personality. Katara has already had several Mary Sue moments, Sokka isn't as sexist which is important because he grows to not be sexist and see value in more people. Finally the show takes itself too seriously. The original Avatar knew it was serious and there was a war going on but also understood the Gaang were kids who were too immature for the task they were given but grew into it. The Netflix show has the main characters too mature, too developed without showing it, and the same is true for the episodes even with an hour to have development.","rating":"8\/10","date":"24 February 2024"}

I know some scenes are not exactly the same as the animated series, but I don't think it's problematic. My boyfriend is a fan of the animated series and be enjoyed it.

{"title":"Let Down","review":"It's such a departure from the original series it's disappointing, while also not fleshed out enough to be its own. Some of the issues IMO:\n1. Rushed story lines. Too many things crammed together and criss crossed when they have the runtime needed to avoid that. It's as if there was a game of telephone explaining the original series and this show is what the last person heard.2. No chemistry. They removed certain character\/relationship building moments from the original series that diminish the characters and their arcs.3. Lack of flow. Again, plotlines are rushed and crammed together, but also the scene structures themselves are heavy on effects or filled with wordy exposition. The characters are mostly static and the acting is meh. The sets look like a bad play in a Soundstage Volume and the costumes look like cosplay, especially the beards.As a big fan of the original, I'm upset this reboot doesn't live up to what I hoped. It's certainly better than the movie, but the risks they took didn't pay off IMO. They should change the title to: \"The Ember Island Players present, ATLA\".

{"title":"If you are an OG fan you will love!","review":"Do not listen to the haters who have nothing better to do. This show is amazing! As someone who grew up with this series, watching every Friday night not missing 1 episode, I can confidently say that they did the original show justice. The characters felt like the original characters, the story is as close enough to the original story without it being just a carbon copy of the animated series. I actually like that they trimmed a lot and intertwined some of the plot points to quicken the pace. We don't need 20 something episodes in the age of streaming...go outside. Touch grass. 8 was enough 10 would have been good too. But really i can't think of anything of importance that they didn't cover from the first season so the 8 we got was fine. Also I enjoyed that it was catered to the adults that grew up watching the show so the action was a bit more intense and badass. But it still have some humor and lighthearted moments that made you feel like you were that kid again watching the show back then. The original show still exists for kids to watch, there is enough content to go around for them and also the crybaby adults who want to be fed a nostalgia feeling, which even then won't satisfy them. So do yourself a favor and watch it for yourself and form your own opinion. It's a yes for me.","rating":"10\/10","date":"26 February 2024"}

Yeah there were changes but what need to be there, was there.If I had one critique is that they could have used a few more flashbacks for Aang even if it was similar to Katara's.

Where Wonka is ONLY for kids age 3-9 and their families, Avatar is for all ages. What makes this possible is the solid theme of internal balance expressed outwardly as a journey to balance four outer elements. The recurring topics of meditation and personal dedication, self-honesty and humility needed to excel at martial arts, for both genders, are timeless themes for all ages.2) No one mentions how good these scripts are. Netflix TV series are a mixed bag. Not many of them manage to consistently use a 50 minute canvas with such art and intelligence, using surprise, quiet moments and character development to hold our interest.

Even though the visuals are cool, I think picking better actors could have made the series much better. Aang is annoying and not the impressive Avatar we hoped for.

We were overjoyed and waited with bated breath for the series live action to premiere on Netflix and it was well worth the wait. Can't wait for season 2 renewal news?","rating":"10\/10","date":"23 February 2024"}
{"title":"Impossible to completely adapt an animated classic","review":"My wife and I feel in love with the original Avatar the Last Airbender when it had already been out, we did not have cable. We ended up streaming it in the early days off Netflix and streaming from the Nickelodeon website and fervently watched the Legend of Korra.When the movie of Last Airbender was announced I was excited, but then was disappointed on so many levels.That said, the Netflix adaptation was so much closer to the original that my wife and I both geeked out through must of the show. The main characters were extremely well cast and the action was phenomenal. The world and the characters were fleshed out well. The musical choices were really good too, especially when it came to Iroh and Zuko.I'm glad they added more characters into book one earlier. In a TV series you never know if it's going to be canceled or not and you can only do so much but we're so much groundwork has already been laid they can go back and connect things in a way that they couldn't before.I would recommend this series to anyone who's looking for something with action that's family-friendly for the most part and that are fans of the original series.","rating":"10\/10","date":"26 February 2024"}
{"title":"Thanks, I hate it","review":"Perhaps I'm too early into the show to say this. If you've seen the original show then you might hate it. If you haven't seen it then you'll find an interesting and refreshing story perhaps. For me this lacks the best parts of the show and skips many important scenes and dialogues. Something as simple as momo's introduction was super funny and in the end of an important scene. Both the introduction and the important scene was skipped for a super basic and uneventful scene. Other scenes feel super rushed for no reason at all. Nothing is left to the imagination or to be explored later. The directors or writers forgot that less is more and spoonfeed everything to the viewer.","rating":"5\/10","date":"22 February 2024"}
{"title":"Good adaptation to the original.","review":"You can see that they have a lot of details in the show from the original. Pretty perfect. Most jokes are left out, but still some funny bits. Cgi is also pretty good and they stuck to the script as much as possible. I loved the original and like this one as well.Like also they kept the details in casting of the tribes. Gives a better vibe then the movie they tried. Had fun watching it and want to see more. Acting is slightly off sometimes but not bad.Think people who loved the original will like this one too. Especially that they spent more time one details and recreating the Avatar world.","rating":"9\/10","date":"27 February 2024"}
{"title":"Nothing like you've seen before","review":"This show is nothing like the original cartoon. Major plus side, it is also nothing like the film. This show takes the characters and events you fell in love with from 2005 to 2008 and brings them to life in fresh and different in wonderful ways. Lu Ten's funeral brought me to the floor sobbing (a lot of that was because they played an instrumental of Brave Soldier Boy that Iroh sang in the cartoon in the Earth Kingdom capital to his son's memorial). Every character looks like they were plucked from the cartoon and given realistic features. Katara and Sokka are amazing actors and the kid playing Aang was incredible for an actor his age. They kept in Sokka's wanting to eat Momo and Iroh's live of Pai Sho and tea. They added Mai, Azula, and Ty Lee to season one which felt out of place at first but it really was a nice touch considering how much the actresses actually looked like the cartoon characters. All of the bending is done so well and you could never guess it was done by visual effects. One thing I don't like (it was a smart choice though) is how scary they made Koh the face stealer.","rating":"10\/10","date":"23 February 2024"}
{"title":"This is a masterpiece","review":"What is not to like?It has humor, action, emotions, storyline and one the best CGI I have seen in a long time. It even includes very important messages regarding to life itself. And the best part is, it doesn't require to be bloody, vulgaire or have nonstop sex in it. We have many tv series like that.In my opinion this equals Game of Thrones.I've bingewatched this. It didn't bore me one second. In mather of fact, it drove me on a adventure. I was looking forward everytime for a new episode.I am looking forward to the next season.Please don't compare this to other avatar version.It's not fair. Give this serie a honest chance.","rating":"9\/10","date":"27 February 2024"}
{"title":"Absolutely loved it","review":"What seemed to be impossible to do right had been done. What an amazing show! The new Avatar: The Last Airbender series not only lives up to the high expectations set by the original but also manages to carve out its own identity in the vast Avatar universe. From the stunning animation to the depth of character development, every aspect of the show shines brightly.First and foremost, the animation is breathtaking. The creators have masterfully captured the essence of the original series while incorporating modern techniques to bring the world of bending to life in a whole new way. The action sequences are fluid and dynamic, making every bending duel a visual spectacle.But beyond the animation, it's the characters that truly steal the show. Each member of Team Avatar feels fleshed out and three-dimensional, with their own struggles, triumphs, and growth throughout the series. Whether it's Aang grappling with his responsibilities as the Avatar, Katara honing her waterbending skills, or Sokka's journey to become a capable leader, every character arc is handled with care and nuance.Furthermore, the show doesn't shy away from tackling complex themes and issues. From political intrigue to questions of morality and identity, the new Avatar series isn't afraid to delve into darker territory while still maintaining the spirit of hope and resilience that defines the franchise.Of course, the heart and soul of any Avatar series lies in its world-building, and this new iteration does not disappoint. From the bustling streets of Republic City to the serene landscapes of the Earth Kingdom, each location feels richly detailed and ripe for exploration.In conclusion, the new Avatar: The Last Airbender series is a triumph in every sense of the word. It honors the legacy of the original while forging its own path forward, delivering a captivating and emotionally resonant viewing experience for both longtime fans and newcomers alike. Avatar fans, old and new, owe it to themselves to experience this remarkable show.","rating":"10\/10","date":"1 March 2024"}
{"title":"Wonder if anyone on the set have seen the original work.","review":"Zero character development. Good visual effects. I guess they did not think about philosophy behind the nations (referring to Airbenders vs Firebenders), only thing i could say positive about that scene was gathering all airbenders in the same temple. Especially Omashu was disaster ; city entrance, characters they met , event sequence (which i could say about the whole season) . I suggest not to watch this season if you are a fan like me ( i hope they will do their best with the season two ). In my opinion they need to work on the dialogs, backstory of the characters\/nations and add some taste of humor from the original.","rating":"5\/10","date":"23 February 2024"}
{"title":"Loved the live action series.","review":"I think the adaptation is great. Of course there are differences between the animated series and the live action. And that is perfectly fine and understandable. Unfortunately there are always people complaining, or even nagging. I loved the choice of characters and actors. The details and cgi are amazing. Now I am really hoping the Netflix will decide to work on season. The first season ended in a way that it can be continued. Characters that I really like a lot are Aang, Kamara, and general Iroh. Well, I liked many more, including Zuko, Sokka and even Appa and Momo. The effects are wonderful.","rating":"10\/10","date":"6 March 2024"}
{"title":"The Animation is Still There","review":"If all someone wants, is to watch again the awesome series, watch that. This was a fun time, and I have read the reviews that diss this effort for not being the Animated Series. Really? I know it's not exactly the story of the animated series, but Dune is another favorite of mine and it changes with every new Dune movie or Miniseries...I still love watching.This is \"true\" enough (know any other stories with a tattooed 12 year old frozen for a hundred years with super powers? Lol)\nWhen you watch a series, does it make you want to watch more? I had to watch the entire series; I had a good time (except the spirit world sequence bored me), and I really appreciated the CGI...wow.Let go and enjoy the show...","rating":"9\/10","date":"26 February 2024"}
{"title":"It's avatar","review":"I love avatar, so the more the better. They will do good in the first season and then will take the good and kick the bad in the seasons after. I can't wait. The first season does contain some shoddy acting and corny moments but it is based off an anime. And in the anime the kids are Goofy so it is hard to bring it to live action and try to make it serious. It sticks to the source material pretty well. There are some parts that stump me thinking to myself. Why would they tell the story differently and add things that just didn't happen? It's not significant but why I really enjoy it. I really think it will get better and better throughout the seasons just like the anime. Must watch.","rating":"10\/10","date":"26 February 2024"}
{"title":"It was pretty amazing!","review":"I am a huge fan of the original cartoon and although the Netflix adaptation doesn't follow the OG plot episode by episode the combination of all the fun events and aspects into an 8 episode series is genius. Lots of people have been giving overly critical reviews stating that aspects of the show are missing but they fail to realize that there are restraints when adapting a cartoon to a live action remake, and that despite these restrictions the live action still does an amazing job of capturing the iconic scenes from the cartoon. Overall I think that it was amazing and people should really give this new Team Avatar a chance!","rating":"10\/10","date":"25 February 2024"}
{"title":"I think live action for ATLA is officially dead (if not it should be)","review":"I'm gonna try to keep this short and to the point.1) Shyamalan shouldn't be used as a comparison. I think everyone was in agreement to give it negative infinity stars.2) Character growth was a major role in the show, missed the mark3) Subtlty was yet another component of the cartoon that we missed4) CGI team? You guys get an A+5) Casting? I have no complaints6) I get that condensing plays a major role with live actions but there was PLENTY to cut while keeping the spirit of the show. They Failed in that regard as well. In NO form was I expecting a \"shot for shot\" LA.7) Not interested in ANY continuation of this project8) I've given up on a live action unless it is done 100% by the OG creators.9) Its obvious why the OG creators left this project and \"creative differences\" was being.... kind... to say the least.10) Ending on a lighter note.

Except few minor changes.Regardng Cast - Aang ,Ozai, Iroh, Zuki perfect... Katara, Sokka, Zuko Good...Azula, Mai - terrible.Visual effects are a spectacle, elevating bending sequences to new heights. The choreography of bending battles is a visual feast, striking a perfect balance between respect for the source material and the innovation required for a live-action format.It's a must-watch for fans of the original and a fantastic introduction for those new to the world of bending.

Such as Sky High, Zathura and of course the original cartoon.Also I noticed it shows the different dynamics of each nation really really well. It's got a lot of hidden brilliance in it for those with keen eyes and sharp minds.The subtles of the show really make it something special.

{"title":"Pay no mind to the haters","review":"Anyone moaning about how this is unfaithful or rushed or undeveloped are people who expected a 1:1 recreation of a cartoon in live action form.What we have here is a faithful retelling made with love for the original source material. If you are a newcomer, the story is cleaned up and yes shuffled around a small bit to make it flow as a human narrative. If you have seen the show, you will catch little nods and material they omitted for the better. Do you honestly think the Pirates or Great Divide or Bato would work here? With the cartoon's biggest mishandlings of Aang's character? They were put into places they needed for the narrative to flow cleanly.The show is 20 episodes of 20-25 minutes apiece. We have 8 episodes of 40-60 minutes. The same length of time when you factor in the omitted episodes. If you want cartoon pacing and cartoon timing, go watch the original. It still exists. I absolutely will. It still holds as one of the greatest animated shows ever created. When you want a more humanistic and realistic adaptation, watch this. They both have their place, and for this adaptation the journey is just beginning.","rating":"10\/10","date":"23 February 2024"}
{"title":"As a huge fan of the show.","review":"There are many things I can forgive about this adaptation. Cutting out all the adventuring from like 5 episodes i can forgive. Constant exposition dumps I can forgive. But what I cannot forgive Is retconning the waterbending training of Katara and Aang.This is crucial to their story, and while I agree a person can master something on their own. Katara never felt like she earned it in any way shape or form. Aang never even started his training also which makes less the 0 sense. This whole plot point was a huge mess and for what exactly? I guess they were trying to empower Katara but all it felt like is they gave her powers for free. Stop this immediately netflix, use the masters given to you in the source material properly.","rating":"5\/10","date":"24 February 2024"}
{"title":"Not better or worse - just epic!","review":"Just finished all episodes of 1st season and would like to express sincere gratitude to the production team. I cannot even imagine the amount of effort that was put in martial arts trainings, costume design, set, casting, graphics, soundtracks ... man I am truly impressed with each detail. That was beautiful and immersive.What I appreciated the most about it was how faithful they stayed to the actual storyline and scenes, but completely changing the tone of the show. Thus, making it feel fresh and not repetitive. Many people were complaining about the lack of humor, which I disagree with - they kept the irony and sarcasm vibe - but made it less goofy (which only works well in the cartoon). The dialogue seemed unrealistic sometimes - but it was because they were trying to stick it closer to the animated version style, which again does not work well for real people.Still, the show is more serious and more violent. The emotions of despair and hope that the characters are experiencing are expressed more deeply. I have witnessed the true ugliness of the war here.I don't want to compare it to original any longer, I will watch it whenever I want as it is a completely different show.Finally, just want to praise Zuko's actor for the amazing delivery - I felt his pain every time he spoke. In general, all the characters felt more like real people and not like caricatures of the animated version. Overall, it is easy to jump on a hate train but I'd recommend anyone to watch it with an open mind.","rating":"10\/10","date":"22 February 2024"}
{"title":"Me and my newcomers friends r enjoying this a lot","review":"Is it ENTIRELY faithful? No. But it also shouldn't be. People forget there are TONS of things in animation that just don't translate well in line action. They cut filler material. Oh well. The core story is what matters. Did I feel for everyone like I did in the cartoon? Yep. Sokka, while I won't say was miscast, at times felt a bit cartoonish. That's what live action needs to stray from. Katara didn't feel as \"bad\". Bumi could've been toned down a bit. I enjoyed that Aang didn't mess around so much. It made it more believable to an older audience. Yes, he had his moments of just \"being a kid\", but they weren't overyly focused upon. Iroh was much more realistic, and it was good to see him not be happy behind the scenes. Zuko though. Out of everyone I think he needs to tone back the self pity a little bit. He should be more angry and let little bits of humanity slip out. Yes, he was rash and hasty in the original series but somehow here he comes off as more whiny. Maybe it's a added story arc, I dunno. Anyway, it was NOT a bad adaptation all things considered. Certainly not for a series originally animated. This show, like One Piece cut out the filler episodes. Which made them better in a live adaptation. Cowboy Bebop made the original episodes INTO FILLER, to focus on the overall tale. It was too rushed. This is where one piece and avatar will succeed if they do. By focusing on series plot points and eliminating filler.","rating":"10\/10","date":"5 March 2024"}
{"title":"Excellent revive of a childhood legend","review":"I was an avid watcher and big time fan of the cartoon from a young boy when it was on nickelodeon to my late teen and early adult years.After seeing two episodes I can say I'm very very pleased with the outcome of this revamp!The show uses masterfully woven soundtracks from the original cartoon, as well as music from classic movies that a lot of us remember in a deep tucked away part of our childhood.The characters are very well balanced between adorning their original personalities while maintaining a real life standard.There's a delicate but firm balance between action, violence, and mature themes while keeping it child friendly and engaging.As a child I used to have my father record every episode and we'd sit and watch them together\nIt was a great family bonding experience as we could both enjoy the themes of the show\nI feel this live action carries that plus more! Parents, siblings, and whoever else can come together to watch this show; everyone taking something away from it and feeling like it was truly an enriching experience.Honestly this show is a masterpiece. It teaches the watchers a lot subconsciously while offering a lot of peace and joy. The premise of the show; while based in a fantasy world can be very applicable to the real world. It covers many values, natures and especially spirituality in a natural and lighthearted way.\"Still trying to find Katara's personality\" is something I read the other day\nWhile I can agree it's rather different, I can see the direction they are going with it and think it's worth giving some leeway.","rating":"10\/10","date":"5 March 2024"}

The similarity between the characters in the animated show and the live action is great (Azula, for some reason, excluding). Costumes, environment are of high quality and the story is close to the original.The live action show had taken a more serious stance on the events and had removed some goofy and untimely moments, while keeping the humor when appropriate.The show is depicting WAR.

The show started off fairly strong. PG-13 but still showing the brutality of the fire Nation. But 20 minutes into the first episode things started to slide fast. So far I have two big issues with the show\n1. Aang was to be a goofy kid. He matured over time as situation. Here for some bizarre reason, he's talking all mature philosophical stuff with everyone from episode one, Why ? Then how do you show his character growth? From being all philosophical when he tries to go back to being a goofy kid. It doesn't work. It felt forced!2. This is a big one, why is everyone so horny in the show?!!

And let me tell you, this reimagining is abuselty amazing!Spot-On Casting\nThe casting choices are phenomenal. Gordon Cormier embodies Aang's innocence and determination perfectly, while Kiawentiio Tarbell brings Katara's fierce spirit and compassion to life. Ian Ousley's Sokka adds a layer of humor and vulnerability that endears him to the audience. The supporting cast is equally impressive, with Daniel Dae Kim bringing gravitas to Lord Firebender Ozai and Cristobal Valenzuela channeling the gruff wisdom of Iroh.Faithful to the Core\nThe writers have struck a perfect balance between honoring the original series and carving their own path. The core themes of family, friendship, and hope remain, but they're presented through fresh eyes and new experiences. The action sequences are thrilling, the bending effects are visually stunning, and the world-building is immersive.A New Lens on a Beloved Story\nSure, there are changes from the animated series. But instead of nitpicking, let's appreciate them as creative choices that add depth and nuance to the narrative. This live-action Avatar offers a unique perspective on a beloved story, reminding us why it resonated with so many in the first place.A Must-Watch for Fans and Newcomers Alike\nWhether you're a die-hard Avatar fan or a newcomer to the world of bending, this live-action adaptation is a must-watch.

So what do fake critics do knowing this, they tear the adaptation down saying it lacks this and that from the show which had 22 episodes and didn't have to worry about a huge budget. They did this with \"Halo\", they did this with \"One Piece\", and this is why great adaptations like this likely will get one season, it's honestly sad.

I think the actors did a fantastic job bringing these characters to life, but I will say it took time for me to warm up to them. By the end of it I was completely captivated and immersed in the story. Truly a great adaptation and one look I forward to continue watching!

The characters, the wardrobes and some of the tiniest details were kept in that made the show for me (the cabbage man in Omashu or Jet's piece of wheat).Is it as good as the original? No, but it's 100% better than the movie we got AND it's great in its own right.

Each of the scenes perfectly captured the feel of the settings and demeanor of each character so closely that it was as if you were watching the original series. There's literally nothing that I could point out or complain about because it was so close to the source material that they even included some of the most iconic lines!

I know it is unfair to compare it with the animated version, which was Perfect! Perfect!! Perfect!!!!. Also this series leaves little room for imagination and dialogues blatantly convey anything and everything living no room for speculation or building conversations with your friends about it. I still remember the days when the Animated version was being aired Going to my middle school to have discussions about it and speculating \"this could be that \" or whatever.

{"title":"Best series to watch in 2024","review":"\"Avatar: The Last Air Bender\" live action is the best animated series that I have ever watched in my entire life. The original animated series was made in 2007 and it was created into live action. The series captivates audiences with its rich storytelling, interesting characters, and amazing visual effects.The main story is that in a world where people can manipulate the elements of water, earth, fire, and air, there are four nations fire, air, earth, and water nations. In the past, they all lived together in harmony and the avatar is the one who can control all four elements and has enormous power. The duty of the Avatar is to maintain the world's peace. If one Avatar die, one will born again and all the Avatars are linked. In one day, the fire nation conquered other nations and killed people to occupy the whole world. Unfortunately, Avatar wasn't there to stop the fire nation. But, Aang, the last surviving Airbender and the new Avatar, who must master all four elements to save the world from evil fire lord. In the series, Aang is just a small kid who can only bend the air has a destiny to become the Avatar. So, he has to learn about other bending and his friends are the big supporters for him to become the Avatar.To talk about the characters, each character has their own unique backgrounds, personalities, strengths, and weaknesses. And also the friendship between Aang and his friends are so warming and beautiful. The series also features unique villians, including the fierce Fire Lord Ozai and his son Prince Zuko. The story between father and son is also interesting.Beyond its characters, \" Avatar: The Last Air Bender\" expresses excellent storytelling, beautiful bending action, humor and emotion which create the series worth watching. All 8 episodes are filled with thrilling bending battles, moments of friendship and family and jaw dropping scenes.In my opinion, this series is a must watch in terms of story, acting, visuals all are perfectly organized. Also, the main actor \" Gordan Cormier\" is perfectly fits with \"Aang\" and all the other actors too. I would definitely give 10\/10 to this live action series and I highly recommend to watch it.","rating":"10\/10","date":"4 March 2024"}
{"title":"If you like the original well worth watching... This is not the movie...","review":"My personal opinion was this was a tasteful adaptation of the original animation. They tastefully changed just enough to keep you wandering what was going to happen next and didn't stray too far from the original story. The special effects were amazing and the bending seemed seamless unlike the movie.Sure there are some drawbacks the acting does leave a little to be desired. However there were moments when the characters really shined and I hope they continue to bring the magic to life. The actors will eventually become comfortable and you could see this in some of the episodes. I hope people see this for what it is, not a remake but something to draw you in and make you feel like you are part of that world.This is what the movie could have been so many years ago.","rating":"8\/10","date":"25 February 2024"}
{"title":"Definitely a worthy live adaptation","review":"The new series is definitely a good live adaptation, despite the amount of heavy criticism. The series has excellent bending, and is somewhat faithful to the original plot line - however, I must point out the lack of character flairs with both Katara and Aang and their lack of connection. Something I hope they will work on for season 2.Zuko and Sokkas' actors did really well in portraying them. With zuko I think fans tend to forget that he WAS a mad bratty teenager in season 1.Connecting so many of the plot lines and characters from the series down to one episode was a little heavy and packed for me. They could have easily kept some side characters out. The costume department needs a budget rise. Wigs and makeup tended are to look very cheap and cosplay-ishBut otherwise I really enjoyed the series.","rating":"8\/10","date":"23 February 2024"}
{"title":"ATLA LA FULL REVIEW","review":"First i just wanna say the show isn't as bad as these wannabe fans are trying to make it out to be and it is a HUGE upgrade hit and upgrade from the movie and can totally be netflix's next flagship series if they take the the time to improve the series & quality and acting because the series has MAJOR flaws that make it kinda unbearable .. there's so many scenes with katara that just make you go \"would she even actually say that?\" or if that was intended to be a joke and i understand the series was filmed during 2021 - 2023 .. but the dialogue is absolutely horrible in some scenes to the point i had to pause to even finish the episode ..1 : stop using green screen for every single scene. It made the entire show seem bland and uninteresting because the saturation was so obvious in green screen netflix you have enough money to build sets and add color to it because if this series didn't have bending it would be so bland .. this is atla not got and the creators need to understand if they want this show to be a success then they need to fix that nobody wants a entire cgied show.2. bring back character arcs. As we all know katara would NEVER let sokka talk to her like that without a snarky comeback? I give kiawentiio her props for trying her hardest to bring katara to life as she was just fairly a beginner actor but it's been 5 years if her acting doesn't improve by season 2 then just scrap the whole thing, sokka also felt very boring and a try hard ?? Like his jokes felt so bland and i didn't laugh or even let out a giggle at half of them .. some were funny i can admit.3. let characters have fun. This show is PG13+ but it is okay to let the characters goof off and go on adventures that don't involve violence because that's what made atla fun and this show lacks of that.End of my review i'm all hands on deck for a season 2 i want these improvements before anything.","rating":"9\/10","date":"23 February 2024"}
{"title":"Uninspired & Terribly Bland... So...So...Sad.","review":"This show has been in the works for so darn long. I was really hoping that after marinating in production for so many years that this project would be something a little special and perhaps even add to the story created in the cartoon. It honestly doesn't.Again, and again... studios have proven that just because you toss huge boatloads of money at a project doesn't make it a quality outing. The writing is quite bad and the acting is beyond abysmal. I love B-grade horror film acting, so I can forgive a lot... the lines are delivered like the preparation for a middle school play audition.Despite the budget, the whole series has a YouTube fan-fiction quality about it. So much green screen, bad cgi, and cheesy info dumping.The really sad part is the show wants to distance itself away from the terrible movie but ends up emulating it in so many ways.Fans can probably give it a hard pass.","rating":"5\/10","date":"23 February 2024"}
{"title":"You don't have to be a warrior to be a hero!","review":"Still a kids show brought to life. The characters are young, so don't be looking for season the actors. The TV series does a really good job bringing the animated series into live action. They cut 20 episodes into eight so don't expect it to be verbatim. Overall they brought the characters to life covered the bases. It was entertaining. At times, watching the cartoon felt like Aang was a little annoying felt like they fixed that in this\nseries. Sokka was also not as annoying and came across more as a leader and bigger brother. Zukas voice wasn't right but the actor did a good job and they did a good job showing his progression. Over all I was happy with this take and look forward to next season.","rating":"8\/10","date":"26 February 2024"}
{"title":"Pretty Good I Say. It could have been better.","review":"I rate based on overall rating of the series when I feel overall rating can be better I give a 10 when see overall rating can be worse I give a 1 star. I would rate this series 7-8\/10 for anyone watching for the first time.I'll start by saying that I've not watched the original series. I tried but I couldn't get hooked. Maybe because I'm now too old for all the childish drama.At first the acting looks very bad and the introduction could have been much more like the original series. But as I proceeded I got hooked and I was sold of every bit of it. Why? Because everything somehow works. I finished the series in a day can't wait for the next one. I also watched the series in both my native tongue and in English and the voice actors in my native tongue (Hindi) were amazing in comparison to the English voices which I felt definitely made a difference to the output.","rating":"10\/10","date":"1 March 2024"}

{"title":"They nailed it this time!!","review":"This live action series is visually stunning almost same like in animation. They absolutely nailed it this time.Writing and acting all is perfect. Casting is also damm perfect as well. Loved each and every episode.Special effects are also on par and same like in the animation series which we all loved and enjoyed.Hat's off to the makers of this show and there hardwork shows in full.Acting is superb and character development is at right pace as original. Thanks to the makers as they kept everything as it is.I hope they continue this series & also wish to have full theatre movie on this.A must watch for Avatar fans.","rating":"10\/10","date":"26 February 2024"}
{"title":"I know I might be just a hater ...","review":"The show is roughly 8 hours long. That's almost 24 animated episodes, which is 4 more than what we knew and loved from the start.They rushed through plots, changed the personality of every character, and topped it off with weak dialogue. I very much didn't like how elements of season 2 were used. The whole part in Omashu was wack because of it, and once again, because it was rushed too.There are some positives like Zuko being a solid character, but even his story had REALLY terrible flashbacks and poor slow motion fights. The positives can sum up to one sentence. It's better than M. Night's version.We didn't need this. We had perfection already.","rating":"3\/10","date":"24 February 2024"}

When you watch this show does it not make you feel good inside and wholesome...?The way I see it, this show makes me feel like the avatar has returned to earth and good things are to come like seasons two and three.I love this franchise and every good thing that comes from its creation.

{"title":"A pleasant surprise! Exciting!","review":"Big ATLA fan here. :) Loved and enjoyed the show! It is not perfect, but I love most of the changes they made. And even the changes I wish they didn't make are actually logical and makes sense within the context of the story. Not the same as the original but the same heartbeat as the original show!!!As always love Zuko and Iroh! Aang a cutie pie, and finally, I can relate to Katara! The show made me cry, laugh and giggle like a little girl.Also, so happy at the way they are handling Aang's and Katara's relationship! Season 2 please!Can't wait to re-watch it! And my heartiest best wishes to all the young actors!","rating":"10\/10","date":"1 March 2024"}
{"title":"LOVE","review":"Ok so 1st I was a little disappointed that the scene where the Avatar 1st emerged from the ice wasn't exactly like the animated version BUT I understood why they didn't do that since that (& the Northern water tribe scene) was literally thee only thing that the Avatar the last air bender movie got right so there was no way to recreate that scene without doing it the exact same way! I definitely loved how they all sounded exactly (or close enough) to the animated characters! The comedy was definitely there for live action! I mean you can't have Sokka's hair can't become suddenly electrified every time he does something crazy or they can't survive serious falls & them clumsily walk away in live action it would be weird! Although The Avatar Kyoshi scene wasn't in the cartoon, I LOVED it! & all the little things they did! I'm hooked!

The acting was phenomenal. The graphics were surprisingly good! I really thought they were going to hold back on the graphics and not make this series a big deal like the live action movie but it was 10x better than the live action movie. I really wanted to see Ang go super sayan mode with his avatar transformation but I guess I'll have to wait until the 2nd season comes out. Keep up the great work avatar team, everyone played a great role in their acting oh and free Palestine while I'm at it.","rating":"10\/10","date":"26 February 2024"}
{"title":"Moved the sexism from the teenaged character to the adult writers","review":"By trying to address the issue of sexism, the live-action adaptation of Avatar: The Last Airbender inadvertently reinforced sexist stereotypes and diminished the complexity of its female characters.Suki went from a strong powerful woman who takes command and happents to want a man, into warrior woman is sad and unfulfilled until boy comes along and shows her there's \"more to the world.\" Now her entire character revolves around Sokka.Azula went from being a highly terrifying, vicious prodigy who is genuinely evil, to a petulant child who just wants daddy to notice her. They removed all sense of her initial image of being a capable and independent threat, turning her into a caricature of her former self.Sokka's entire arc of being a sexist character that grew out of it was removed. It was meant to teach a LESSON on sexism. By failing to recognize that and removing it, the show inadvertently endorses the very sexism it sought to critique.Katara went from being an adversarial feminist and mature, to a character who... well, wait, there is no character here. She's just gone.In short, Avatar: The Last Airbender went from having a non-sexist show with sexist characters that grow and learn from that, to having characters that are not sexist in a show that is.","rating":"1\/10","date":"26 February 2024"}
{"title":"I really like it","review":"I really loved the animated version. The best part i've only seen it once so i don't remember most of it but i really enjoyed it.Now that i'm watching the love action without much memory of the original, i'm really enjoying it. It's like reliving the show bit wit a completely different feel.Things i like\nPace if fast enough\nIt's not a complete replica so it's a new experience but the nostalgia is still there\nI'm currently enjoying it as much as the animeI think they caught the essence of every characters.Hard to match animation but i think this one is pretty amazing so far into episode 5.","rating":"10\/10","date":"2 March 2024"}
{"title":"Long overdue, not perfect, but true to the original","review":"I'm so happy that they made a live action that has tried to stay loyal to the original. Granted, it wasn't perfect, but it was miles better from the 2010 movie adaption. With flashbacks to Gyatso and Aang, Katara and her mon, Sokka and his dad, Iroh and his son & Zuko and his father, I feel we got to connect with the most important characters of book 1.Surprisingly, my favorite characters in this adaption were Zuko and Iroh. The emotional backstory of how Iroh and Zuko came together and became basically father and son, made me teary-eyed. They did a great job with the emotional reveal of how Zuko saved the 41st division from being sacrificed.The one that clicked the least for me was probably Aang unfortunately. It started off well, but I feel like the original Aang was still more childlike and quirky, so I missed that in this season. I feel like if they work more with Aang's innocence and playfulness on the next season, it will feel more true to the original character.In terms of comedic value, there is still some work to be done, but the emotional stories provide enough for it to be enjoyable. I really do appreciate that they included the cabbage man! I found that bit funny and it definitely clicked for me. I hope that they put more effort into the comedic bits in the next season, but overall, I'm looking forward to season 2.","rating":"9\/10","date":"25 February 2024"}
{"title":"A beautifully crafted adaptation with lots of emotion.","review":"This adaptation gave justice to the fans but it also proves that you can follow the original source, and make some minor changes so it can be adapted. It's respectful to the original but it also tries to be its own thing. The one problem I faced during it, was the fact that this show didn't feel like it had a soul. It takes a few episodes until it finds its footing in tone and emotions with the crescendo being at the final few episodes making me say \"I need a season 2 now.\"\nIt's a fun and a character driven show with plenty of homages and even more characters bonding with each other. Deserves a watch by every fan out there.","rating":"9\/10","date":"23 February 2024"}
{"title":"9 out of 10. Gets MOST of it Right","review":"Does it follow the series? Mostly. Some of the story-telling is in a different order. Are most the characters there. Mostly. And certainly more humor than Shyamalan disaster.BEST WAY TO WATCH IT, is the same way you watch a movie made from a book. They are two DIFFERENT forms. DON'T expect them to be exactly the same!!!! I will give it 4 out of 5 stars. Most of the acting is great. The costumes and cinematography are gorgeous. Most of the casting is spot on. Suki and Sokka rock my world. Sokko's look, comedic timing, and general vibe is PERFECT! He and Suki's chemistry. WOW! Iroh is wonderful, Zuko, Katara & Ang are growing on me. The CGI works. It's action packed and engaging.Did it bother me that they combined 3-4 episodes from the animated series into one live-action? Sure, but it was well done, made sense, and made it accessible to those who hadn't watched the entire series.","rating":"9\/10","date":"27 February 2024"}
{"title":"Why can Aang fly???","review":"The show was good in its own right, but as an Avatar the Last Airbender show it falls short. Unlike the original show this one doesn't have the charm or compelling story to keep it interesting. Every episode is dragged on and some storyline's from the original show are all just mashed together in one storyline. The performances of all the actors were amazing they all did a great job, but the characters from a written stand point felt off. None of them felt like their original characters and there were significant character development moments that were taken out. There was also significant changes in Aang's Airbending capabilities, the fact he could fly without his glider shows that the writers had no idea what they were doing. Overall, if you're a new fan I think you would enjoy it, but if you're a long time fan nostalgic to the original then this wouldn't be for you. Especially if you're looking for a shot to shot remake.","rating":"3\/10","date":"24 February 2024"}
{"title":"Making impossible possible","review":"It is never an easy job to adapt a masterpiece to live action and more often than not attempts fell flat. The expectations are sky high and if you don't give at least 100% most likely you'll fail. Even if you do 100% there will be some who are so married to the original that they won't open their mind to see what you have done.I can't tell you what this team has done or haven't done during the making of this show, but I can tell you what shows is they tried their absolute best to give 100% or if even possible, even more.First of all they took the subject matter and treated it with respect. The casting... I could write a small essay on the casting, few shows\/movies can nail this so perfectly. I was on the edge of my seat every time a major character was introduced, because they just fit so well. The CGI and graphics is perfect, and not self serving, the pictures and motifs are drawn by people who get it. The sound and music is amazing, which is less suprising, if you saw the behind the scenes on the orchestra, but still.Last but not least, I am a huge fan of the original and for me this has the avatar spirit as well, it was like coming home.Please do yourself a favor and ignore the negative reviews. See the pilot and decide yourself.","rating":"10\/10","date":"12 March 2024"}

Good effects as well.It's literally following the cartoon storyline as well as the acting style. The characters are the same as in the cartoon. At first I didn't expect it to be so much like the cartoon because a more serious style would be good too but I'm sure they wanted it to be good for children and adults. So can't complain.I seen a bunch of haters on social media being all nerdy about it so I have to make up for their overexagerated negative reviews. Good job Netflix for this entertaining show.","rating":"10\/10","date":"7 March 2024"}

{"title":"Masterpiece!","review":"This is what to expect from a live-action adaptation of the animation series. It not only preserves the values of the original work but has enriched the context of the story from the source with a more mature and emotional approach. The adaptation also enriches themes that are less lifted in the original works such as Aang's struggle as the new Avatar and his friends, Zuko's background and the fire kingdom. This adaptation deserves a second chance for the second season! Don't bury this version of the adaptation, not anymore.The flaws in this adaptation may be that the dialogue that sounds pushy and the acting of actors in some parts does not feel right. However, ah come on! Most of them are new actors who deserve the opportunity. I'm hoping for a second season can fix a little bit of that shortfall. (To be honest, insignificant flaws) choice of actor so far perfect! It's hard to imagine there's going to be a better adaptation of Avatar The Last Airbender than this in the future.I think the way the writer summed up an episode of the original work into one episode was very genius. Although there are trimming some details of the original work, there are new details and contexts added to make this live action work. Remembering the storytelling approach in animation is different from live action. This adaptation do justice to this animation. The selected actors also managed to very well manifest the animated characters.","rating":"9\/10","date":"25 February 2024"}

Greedy studios ruining one of the best pieces of television and millions of people's childhoods for a cash grab and FOR THE SECOND TIME. IT IS EMBARRASSING. DO NOT WATCH THIS SHOW.

It is as faithful to the original as one can get - we got justice.

Sure, could the narrative and script be closer to the anime series? Absolutely.

This is not a perfect adaptation, but there is so much story and fan service I got to witness in live action, I can't wait to see more. Great actors, cool combat, a few weeks, but ultimately faithful. Really happy to see them visually represent the cartoon in great fashion on screen. They did pack a few too many things into som episodes, but I still understood and could follow knowing the cartoons. If you haven't seen the cartoons, watch them first then this.

The costumes, scenery and design were everything a fan could hope for, the actors even resembled the characters. However, the storyline and script were unforgivable. The writers said this show was \"..a remix, not a cover..\" and that can be expected and respected, but if they didn't plan to stick with the original work they could have wrote a new story in the same universe. This show seemed like its main goal was to be better than the movie and they succeeded in that, but they disrespected the series to a point of blasphemy.","rating":"2\/10","date":"28 February 2024"}

{"title":"Evaluation of the series Avatar","review":"The new Avatar series is one of the best series that I watched in the year 2024, and it is better than the Avatar movie that was shown in the past, but the problem is that the second and third parts have not been released, and I am very excited and I know that it will impress me a lot. And if I will talk about photography and directing, it is something incredible. The creativity continues throughout eight episodes, and some scenes were shortened from the original cartoon, but it was something incredible. I have always waited for a movie or series about Avatar, and here it is, the best series I have ever watched, and the choice of actors was wonderful. Aang mastered his role beautifully, and the actor playing Zuko showed us very beautiful scenes, the same as the cartoon scenes, and better, but the character I think most resembles the cartoon is the King of the Fire Nation, Ozai, and this is something they play with in the series.","rating":"10\/10","date":"20 May 2024"}

Could have had a multiple movie run, the script was literally written for him, and yet........\nThis TV series; however, is bang on for casting, characters personalities, special effects are awesome.

After the first two episodes I was HIGHLY discouraged to continue: the acting wasn't there, the storylines were mixed up and overal I was just not feeling it. But I was determined to watch the whole thing and thank God I did!! The last 4-5 episodes really make up for everything and even through some of the cringy scenes I LOVED how they merged certain storylines and highlighted ones that I feel like we were missing out on in the original. I especially lovedto see how powerful Aang truly is as an airbenderthe origins of Iroh and Zuko's relationshipthe mixed storylines at Omashuthe effects, obviouslyI'm rating this 10\/10 for two reasons, one, never has a show turned my head after an initial disappointment like this one halfway through and I admire that. I just needed to give it time and get used to their way of storytelling. Two, I see a HUGE potential and I really feel like this was made to honor the original one and (dare I say?) make it even better, and my 10\/10 goes in favor of having a second season. I'll be devastated if Netlfix kills this before we could see Toph and Zuko's redemption arc and if I have to be generous with my rating for that to not happen, well, it doesn't hurt me to give it the 10\/10. Let's go everyone, I want to see season 2!!!","rating":"10\/10","date":"26 February 2024"}
{"title":"Netflix Want Game of Thrones, not Avatar","review":"Netflix managed to turn a colourful, hopeful, hilarious cartoon about series issues into yet another gritty, dull fantasy about series issues the characters all stand around and talk about.Where is the joy? Why is Aang so stoic? Why is every line simply exposition or saying out loud how they're feeling. Why did they remove all of the characters growth and learning? I feel like the creators didn't put enough faith into the story they were telling, and relied too much on nostalgia. Did I laugh at the hippie minstrel cameo? Of course! Did it make any sense in the greater context of the story? Not at all.As someone else said, it feels like there was no time for pre-production. The costumes were amazing but with no wear and tear to them, so the cast looked like cosplayers. The writing needed several more drafts. The poor kids needed longer to prepare. And you can tell each department worked extremely hard, but without proper pre-production and planning, nothing will disguise the flaws.I wish this was a good adaptation.","rating":"3\/10","date":"26 February 2024"}

Bravo.Casting aside, the costume, makeup, special effects are amazing.My review isn't long enough so enjoy the opening sequence lol\n\"Water. Earth. Fire. Air. My grandmother used to tell me stories about the old days, a time of peace when the Avatar kept balance between the Water Tribes, Earth Kingdom, Fire Nation, and Air Nomads. But that all changed when the Fire Nation attacked. Only the Avatar mastered all four elements. Only he could stop the ruthless firebenders. But when the world needed him most, he vanished. A hundred years have passed and the Fire Nation is nearing victory in the War. Two years ago, my father and the men of my tribe journeyed to the Earth Kingdom to help fight against the Fire Nation, leaving me and my brother to look after our tribe.

Bending techniques, the way the elements connect with the bodies of the characters, the places all look wonderful. They bring the world alive. However, that is not what ATLA is about. In order for the characters to have their development we need to see their interaction, we need to see their characters, that is why we love the characters in the cartoon. Here the characters are all over the place. There is no goofiness, they are all too serious which bothers.Also, showing things subtly, inserting the message between the lines is the strength of the cartoon. Here they deliver ling winded, empty, and bland speeches that do not move us.644 out of 854 found this helpful.","rating":"10\/10","date":"6 March 2024"}
{"title":"Give Live Action a Chance","review":"C'mon !!! You all can't expect a huge series or a well-rounded explanation and story like the original series does.I admit that it feels a bit off without humor or it seems like the stort is a little but fast paced. However, it should be considered about the budget and the length of the series. Why are you all expecting like it would be like the original? There won't be any live-adaptation or live action series that will make better than the originals especially Avatar: The Last Air Bender.At the moment, I see no big mistakes or flaws in the series. The visuals are stunning and it's been an amazing work that they can remake this far. Give the series a chance.","rating":"10\/10","date":"23 February 2024"}
{"title":"For what?","review":"Avatar: The Last Airbender is one of my favorite cartoons. I watched it ten times, and each time I never thought, \"I want to see Avatar with real actors.\" However, when I heard about this project, I was not angry, because I know that this is the new school of Hollywood: we need to shoot a remake, a film adaptation of a cartoon or a book. But when I started watching this product, I said to myself: \"What the hell is going on?!\" I said this because the entire structure of the original animated series was thrown into the trash, and that's the biggest mistake they could have made. The structure of the original animated series is one of the best parts.Plus: graphics\nMinus: structure, actors, environment design.","rating":"2\/10","date":"24 February 2024"}
{"title":"Great Spin-Off","review":"In defense of the live-action adapation. Really, what did you guys expect? There isn't and will never be anyhting like the cartoon of AtLA, anything that could keep up with our nostalgia and our love for Team Avatar and their journey. So let's stop comparing this show to our beloved cartoon and see it as, like, a spin-off, all right? Because as a spin-off I'd say it does a decent, even amazing job.Yes, the young actor's performances may be a little stiff and flat sometimes, but remember: it's their first big role. Let them grow into it.Yes, they made changes, but firstly it works and secondly most of them are pretty cool. For example:\n-- Zuko containing more than just one emotion (that being rage): He is excited, artistic, insecure and even soft and vulnerable. To me he seems much more like a human being and not only like personified trauma\/coping. Plus I love his notebook and pinwall as an expansion of his obsession with the Avatar.-- Putting the waterbending scroll into the possessions of the elders of Wolf Cove and passing it on to Katara from there makes sense.-- Making Yue a waterbender and spiritual guide also makes sense.-- Showing Ozai actively poisoning Azula against her brother is awesome to witness.-- Adding lore that didn't make it in the cartoon, like The Mother of Faces or Avatar Kyoshis childhood. Cool stuff.-- While the cartoon has been made for kids, you feel the brutality and weight of war far more this time, and I personally like it a lot.They did a great job with intertwining several episodes\/plot-lines into one another. Combining the freedom fighters, the mechanist, the cave of two lovers and Omashu was a smart idea. Also they kept lots of favourite moments from the cartoon even though they had to cut much from the source material.Visually, it is perfection. The bending, the architecture, the hybrid animals, the costumes, the amount of details ... it is eye candy.And yes, this show has flaws. But which show hasn't these days? In my opinion they stayed faithful to the source material. They may have came up with new interpretations of the plot and the characters, but it still works if you stop chaining it to the unreachable cartoon. Please, please, please let another season happen. I want more of Dallas Liu as Zuko. And I'd love to see the other actors of Team Avatar grow more into the footsteps of their cartoon characters. Let's give them a chance, friends, they did good so far.","rating":"9\/10","date":"26 February 2024"}
{"title":"This series reminds me of \"The Last Airbender 2010\"...","review":"This series reminds me of \"The Last Airbender 2010\"... Aang in that movie was Noah Ringer, A white boy with some Native American heritage. Ringer's taekwondo instructor, Master Eric Pechacek, started watching the \"The Last Airbender\" comic version, noticed the resemblance of Ringer to Aang, in both appearance and personality. This eventually led to Ringer being cast as Aang in \"The Last Airbender 2010\"... i was sorry to realize that the \"The Last Airbender 2010\" movie did not get a sequel probably because of covid. Aang in the current \"Avatar: The Last Airbender (2024)\" is Gordon Cormier, a Canadian of Filipino descent and European descent. Anyhow, to me, i think Noah Ringer made a better Aang... That guy was literally born to play Aang... i think Aang in the \"Avatar: The Last Airbender (2024)\" version is a watered down version of the real thing... i'm sure people will agree with me if they watch \"The Last Airbender 2010\"...","rating":"10\/10","date":"26 February 2024"}

Not the original, if you want to see the original watch the cartoon.Character casting, storyline flow, and effects are 10\/10. Some things are a bit different such as the lack of Sokka and his sexism in the earlier episodes so his character development is a bit lacking.Don't get me wrong some other things are different too but they had to do that in order to make sense and have it more realistic as a live action series.Given this series is more realistic; it gives more life into the characters and their backgrounds~it basically fills in some missing gaps from the original series.I would recommend and give it a try.","rating":"9\/10","date":"23 February 2024"}

{"title":"Such a Let Down","review":"1. I know this was for kids, but it felt made for kids. The movie, which it is hard not to compare it to, was much more likeable for all audiences.2. Men were made to be silly, crazy, bad, or weak, but all the women were strong, powerful, and purposeful. Look, I am a woman... I appreciate a strong woman character, but when it gets to \"message pushing,\"and overdone, it seems manipulative. Let men have their heroes also. Just because there are strong women don't mean the men have to be stupid or weak.3. The princess. Huge disappointment. Don't get me wrong, this woman is beautiful in her own way, but she was silly looking in that fake wig. When comparing her to the movie actress, it is hard to take this new actress, in the cheap wig, seriously.4. The Avatar was not believable in the slightest. The Avatar in the movie had some masculinity & sadness mixed with some naivety and it worked really well. This Avatar seemed like a kid dressing up for Cosplay. I am sure he is a great actor, but I would have never cast him for this role. People want a hero, not a therapist.5. Everyone felt sorry for themselves 100% of the time. Constantly \"poor-me,\" all the time. Constant whining. I got to the point that anytime there was a serious conversation, that I just fast forwarded it. I still understood what was happening. Everyone has a sob story... and that is OK, but they drone it on and on and on in every episode. At some point you wish the Fire Lord would win. Not one character was worth rooting for.6. The acting was not that great. If they would have kept the series as a Fantasy\/Action show rather than spending 90% of the time making it a drama, then I think it would have been a lot better. There were too many heavy topics from every character. Too many sad people which made for flat acting. The times a joke was attempted, it also landed flat, and was usually focused on some man who did something dumb.7. Horrible graphics and CGI\n8. Please help me... that rat looking character has no purpose other than to be cute. It's like Jar Jar Binks all over again.9. Dude... some of the writing is so cheesy.10. Some good actors in this, but they don't get enough screen time.","rating":"3\/10","date":"26 February 2024"}
{"title":"This adaptation wasn't perfect, but bloody brilliant imo","review":"Look, for people like me who loved the animated series, a live action remake was always going to be risky. I basically wrote it off as a failed attempt just from the trailers alone. Yet, yesterday, I watched the entire season. Episode after episode, and I ABSOLUTELY LOVED IT! Of course it changed a lot from the original, of course it mashed some things together, and changed a bit of the lore, but that's because it's set in a real-life environment! It can only be so animated before it gets weird or cringey, and it was right of them to step away from some of the more silly subjects (like Avatar day for example).I've been disappointed with the fans of the original cartoons response to this show. I've seen a lot of pointing out what the show DIDN'T do and completely missed what they DID do. They did an awful lot. This is the best live action adaptation of Avatar we will probably ever see. Its great for new audiences and it should be respected by fans of the old show.ATLA is up there as one of the most important pieces of work in my life, and do I think the live action is better? Hell no. Because that's impossible. But it was awesome and I loved it in its own way. I can't wait for season 2 and I hope the fan base don't gate-keep this show from being successful by being naive and giving it bad reviews just because it 'isn't as good as the original'Some of the acting from the kids was my only negative take away. Genuinely. And that's because they're kids and 9\/10 kid actors kind of suck, due to, You know, being a kid.Zuko, Zhao, Sokka, Iroh, Bumi, Ozai.. all fantastic. Anyone who says otherwise betrays the ideals of the original characters. These guys NAILED IT! I am also looking forward to seeing more Azula, they changed up her story a bit (by giving her one in the first season) but I was digging it hard. She and the Azula-gang have the energy spot on, can't wait to see Ty Lee and Mai kick some butt!Give it a chance, this adaptation was amazing. Hats off to the writers and directors for shining light on the original source for more people to be a part of, and hopefully soon Avatar will get the appreciation world-wide for the incredible work it is.","rating":"9\/10","date":"23 February 2024"}
{"title":"Be flexible like an air bender","review":"I have been a fan of the last Airbender, since it first came out so many years ago. Until this day, I will watch it every single time without fail.I also saw the original movie, which I, like many people did not like.I went into watching the show with an open mind. It's hard to take an animated show by many who we've had nothing but time to dissect every single detail and pack it all into a live action film.I feel as though they mashed everything together for sake of time. As we know, the relationship between Sokka and Suki took a bit more time to come together, and I feel like it was after he met the moon goddess I wouldve like them to stick to the book of water first, and then the Earth Kingdom. However, I also know that they shouldn't be scene for scene, it's an adaptation and meant for a lot of people who may not have watched the original version and for people who have.The acting wasnt earth shattering, but it wasn't horrible. I think the acting was supposed to be a bit more cartoonish than super serious, just based on the tone the original cartoon.I absolutely love the young man who played Aang. I feel like he was a really good pick for it. People forgot that was very mature, but he was also a child. So it's a balance that I think the kid did pretty well.I didn't go in here, believing that this was going to be exactly like the cartoon. I know they're gonna take liberties because a lot of people don't necessarily need to see it play for play, if you are a This might be hard to watch for you, especially if you feel like you want to see the exact same thing from the past in live action.But if you're just a fan of the concept, I think this would be the show for you.","rating":"8\/10","date":"25 February 2024"}
{"title":"ABSOLUTELY BREATHTAKING. YOU WILL TEARBEND.","review":"Heart. Compassion. Empathy. There are moments in life which demand reflection--a masterclass in storytelling is one of them. The craft of cinema has never been better. Visually spectacular, this adaptation is driven by a narrative full of heart. There is anguish, but there is also beauty. Pain and suffering, but echoes of serenity and redemption reverberates throughout its core. Moments of humor to ease our footsteps in the world sliced by the dauting blade of truth. Characters of strength undone by the prospect of love. Characters of ignorance enlightened by splendid grace. Characters of ruthlessness upended by the wrath of their own demise. This is a tale destined to become one of the greatest of all time; a classic for the ages to come.I am in awe of the beauty, serendipity and elegance of this incredible series. The choreography created to capture the momentum and movement of each the bending styles was a feast for the eyes. The wondrous backdrop elements of the setting landscapes across varying nations were insurmountable in their granduer. The costume designs etched with their plethora of color and insignia to dawn their respective nations beckoning pride and representation. Such immaculate attention to detail. Such radiance and deference to honor its animated series counterpart.I felt every sorrow and angst. I understood every nuanced deciet and intention. I was spellbound. Bountiful moments tearbending. Plentiful moments laughing. Gutwrenching moments of truama and its sudden reality.Please watch this masterpiece. Please continue the storylines for Book 2 and Book 3.

I loved the original series.But I'm glad to report that I was more than pleased with this newest iteration.I was initially worried about the way they deviated from the storyline in the beginning; however, I was pleased that they circled back on the things they left out and ended up weaving them back into the story, albeit in a somewhat reimagined way.It was enjoyable to see iconic, classic, and even hilariously strange things from the original series in the new version. I worried that the studio might leave out some of the more random things from the original, such as the \"secret tunnel\" hippies, the angry spirit of the forest, the giant ocean monster in the battle, etc.Very pleased.

This live action version of Avatar the Last Airbender is faithful to the story of the cartoon while also taking enjoyable liberties with the retelling.

Bumi, Zuko, Aang, Sokka, Iroh, Suki, Ozai, Appa, Momo, Jet and the mechanist are played fantastically, the rest is very good - okayish. The series got better through the episodes, I loved the end, hated how Yue looked lol.9\/10 - Bending, just amazing.8\/10 - Cast (background actors etc. Included made it whole lot better)9\/10 - Visuals (Didn't like how it looked when he talked with Kyoshi, Roku and Kuruk, would've loved a more epic scenery and more wisdom in animated Roku style. LOVED how Omashu, the tunnel, the wolf cove, the north, the air temple etc. Looked.6\/10 - Pace of the story, felt messy in bits, hard to grasp what is happening with so many side stories at once8\/10 - The story itself - Backstory on the genocide, Gyatso, Spirit world, Real world, Past \/ Current times, Zuko's story, Lu Ten, Azula, A LOT of information packed in it, I loved to take that in, even though it was different and way more to handle than you are normally used to. Some changes I loved, liked and some I hated and didn't like.5\/10 - Light and shadows in most scenes were what stood out to me, felt awkwardly placed lots of times6.5\/10 - Character development, by the changes they've made, the characters journey throughout the series felt lacking. Of course they grew as characters, but felt whackyAs I weight the bending, cast and visuals the most, I would still rate it 8\/10.

{"title":"Utterly Enjoyable, Absolutely Stunning","review":"This may have left some moments out from the anime, and changed a few minor details, but that should be expected of any live action remake of anything. Overall, they stuck incredibly true to the source material more than many other live action remakes out there. The special effects and CGI work are breathtaking, the costuming is absolutely on point, the action scenes were immaculately choreographed, and the characters were perfectly casted! Aang may still be learning to come into his confidence as an actor, but that should be expected, he is a child for goodness sakes, and he killed it regardless! I'm sure he will just get better and better as the show continues on as well and I look forward to it! I couldn't have hoped for more from this series, and I pray to god they get to complete it, and that people stop being so overly harsh and critical.

I never watched the previous movie either. This show isn't perfect, some of the acting isn't great but I really love the visuals and story. I found some scenes quite emotional especially when you realise the main character is literally a child who loses pretty much everything and is now expected to save the whole world. I liked the fighting scenes especially the air and earth benders. Kyoshi was definitely a stand out for me, I loved her scenes. So I know this adaption isn't perfect and many things were changed according to fans of the original.

{"title":"A more visceral, action-packed, tension-induced Avatar that gets the big things right","review":"Listen. The original Avatar is an animated masterpiece. That experience is available to us all whenever we want it. This is a different experience entirely. One that works for those who don't know the original at all and also those who do. It does this by not trying to be a shot for shot remake of the original. Instead, it feels more like a PG13 graphic novel take on the same material. Slightly more maturity. Slightly more action and combat. Slightly more tension from a more cinematic combination or visuals and orchestral score. It still feels like Avatar but it's moved up from age 8 and up more to age 13 and up. As a parent of a 9 and 6 year old I personally watched the series first so that I could warn my youngest of potentially upsetting scenes. I would recommend the same for parents out there with similar concerns because although the deaths are handled with dignity and clever shot perspectives to reduce the perception of gore... people are still being killed via bending in ways that the imagination knows would be painful.The condensing of S1 works well by focusing on the main storylines and increasing the pace of the scenes. Normally this approach would be terrible but because our heroes are effectively on the run and being sought I feel the increased pace actually works quite well. I was concerned that more of the character nuance and some of the quieter moments of character growth might be lost with this approach but they shockingly find a lot of economical ways to sneak such scenes in.The action cinematography is at times Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon-quality. The world building is top tier and transports you away. These places feel like places you'd like to see. The acting is more varied. Some absolutely dominate the screen. Others don't. I'm hoping that their archs ahead in seasons 2 & 3 help the weakest links among the cast to find their voice and command the screen similarly. It's possible they will and that their growth will feel purposeful.I was shocked by how much I loved season 1. The animated series is one of my favorites and I was worried about this adaptation but I can't wait for the next 2 seasons. They got all of the big stuff right and the live action added more to the experience than I thought was possible.","rating":"9\/10","date":"22 February 2024"}

Anyway here is pros and consPros: Absolutely incredible visuals throughout the entirety of this season, wonderful blending of the anime episodes and characters into the live action (secret tunnel song the cabbage man), and the story was top notchCons: honestly not many, I feel episode 1 had some acting flaws here and there but nothing crazy. The comedy wasn't as good as the anime but it's to be expected, they did well with what they had while advancing the story.Overall a great live action adaptation that I hope they will continue with (I really want to see Toph!

We can say that it was done inexperiencedly. The acting and dialogues are terrible, the cast is only correct as a showcase. They tried to create a new story using every element in the original show, but it was messy and sloppy because each of them was processed by omitting important details and many things were tried to be told at the same time. I watched the Avatar story years ago.

BUT can we not give this a chance?It captures the elements of the original in some aspects but we have to accept this show done the cartoon series some massive justice. The Easter eggs and hopes of Netflix wanting to revive it for season2 (or book 2) is near and far. I accepted this series needed some work but in my opinion it done the series a lot of justice. The scenery, the sets and the acting was everything I expected from a first time proper attempt from Netflix for this title.I can guarantee that if Netflix did 16 episodes the show would have been more refined and fresh to its current and previous audience. Let's hope Netflix see this and renew it for longer season in book 2 and make what all fans across the world are hoping for. Overall it was a great show and there is no need to nit pick the pettiness every other person is doing for what the original held. Just remember this is what every fan has been hoping for and Netflix have done its fans the justice it's been looking for since it's predecessor done on that horrific movie.","rating":"10\/10","date":"25 February 2024"}

It carried like the cartoon I would watch with my kids. It takes you on a traditional hero's quest with very good storytelling, fantastic costumes, and outstanding CGC effects. I gave it a 9 because of these reasons and the fact it stayed true to the same feel of the cartoon instead of making similar mistakes as the live action movie. I will say it's probably better to binge rather than space out because of the way the story unfolds so I am glad I waited until they were all available before giving this series a chance.

{"title":"Mostly great cast, excellent story adaptation.","review":"Comparing to the cartoon, Katara isn't very spicy and Iroh is a little too huggable. A bit disappointed with sheepish Katara, but huggable Iroh is a welcome adaptation. His character, along with the overall adaptation gives more emphasis to Zuko's struggles.Some of the very small roles were poorly acted, but generally, the cast is incredible, especially Sokka. The effects are exceptional - worlds better than most Marvel movies. And the story follows the original series fairly closely so far, with most changes paying homage to the original events in some way.Aside from Katara's character being uncharacteristically (and somewhat distractingly) timid, this is overall a fantastic series so far that is so well cast, written, and directed it feels like watching the original show.","rating":"8\/10","date":"28 April 2024"}
{"title":"Can't get enough...despite the changes","review":"Is so refreshing to see the avatar story with a different take. Yes the animated version is epic and nobody will change that. But seeing this beautiful adaptation of so such a beloved story is absolutely mind blowing. The cast, the back stories, the fights sequences, the Easter eggs, the jaw droping details on costumes, places, CGI and the added darkness is all there. Is definitely up to par with what I would expect a live action version of the Avatar would be.There is room for improvement but considering how difficult the original material is. Its freaking fenomenal so much that I want to watch more and more.I confess I already watched it twice. ;)Do yourself a favor and either if you watched the original or not. Give it a chance and don't let yourself get confused with the negativity. Take it for what isn't is and enjoy it as it's own story.

So when Netflix announced a live action adaptation I wasn't quite sure what to think. The special effects are not the best and it does hinder emersion. The comedy also does not land nearly the same as it did to it's animated counterpart. The fight scenes are decent but once again, they can't hold a candle to the original source material.

{"title":"Not bad , can be better","review":"I have seen the anime about 4 or 5 times , alone and with my older kids and then with my younger kid , and I think it one of the best shows ever.I am not trying to compare the live series to the anime , but rather trying to compare the feeling I get when watching each.I think the live adaptation captures a lot of the animes spirit , humour and intent and made me feel at times like I felt when watching the anime.But there is something uneven in the series , with some parts feeling like they are not coming together , especialy last episode.I hope this will get fixed in the next seasons...","rating":"8\/10","date":"27 April 2024"}
{"title":"Great adaptation","review":"I feel like this series is suffering from prejudice more then anything else.It follows closely the story of the original series, while changing some very small traits of the characters.One example is Aang is not as oblivious and care free as he was in the original animated show, which I personally view as a plus to his overall character development.Second are some small changes were done to Soka he is much more mature and not as stupid as he was originally in the animated series, this Soka feels more as the one from Season 3 and 4 from the start which I personally liked.The changes done are minuscule and I feel as they helped telling the epic story more clearly and with less distractions.I personally enjoyed this slightly more adult tone the series takes as it differentiates it self from the original, after all, it is an epic story of growing through war, loss and suffering, having of putting slapstick would just undermine the overall plot points and character sacrifices.Bottom line It is a slightly more adult, and I mean slightly, adaptation of the original, missing some of the original silliness, but replacing it with more down to earth way of seeing things and acting on them.I strongly would recommend it to people who have watched the original and to people who haven't, don't buy in to the review bombs give it a chance as it is a very good adaptation of book 1.","rating":"9\/10","date":"23 February 2024"}
{"title":"Many positive aspects comparing to the original","review":"Positive impressions:The relationship between Zuko and Iroh is much better developed, showcasing Iroh's importance in Zuko's life and the origin of Zuko's dilemma as the heir to the Fire Nation but exiled due to an altruistic act. Unlike the cartoon, where the focus is mainly on capturing the Avatar, here the series explore Zuko's kindness, repressed due to his father's evil desires.Ozai is portrayed as a super toxic father figure who manipulates and provokes his children, unlike in the original cartoon where he's primarily seen as just a villain who wants to dominate the world. His character arc is more nuanced, and the series show exactly what Ozai did to culminate in Azula's descent into madness and Zuko's desperate desire for redemption.Aang's melancholy and intuition are more pronounced, reflecting an implicit loneliness as the last airbender and the pressure of being the Avatar tasked with saving the world. This aspect is better explored compared to the cartoon, where his role as the Avatar feels more like a heroic trait rather than a duty or sacrifice as shown in the series.Katara's trauma is explored from the beginning, strengthening her character and showcasing her mastery of waterbending. The series show that she's a prodigy just like Aang in her respective element. Unlike the show, where her improvement feels solely attributed to training, here her talent is acknowledged, and it is explicit that her bending was repressed her whole life due to Fire Nation threats.Aang's chance to revisit a past friend, Gyatso, and receive necessary closure is a poignant moment, it was like a gift to the character, a medicine to his wounds, as his melancholy and guilt were more overtly than in the cartoon.The series manages to be unpredictable at times, presenting characters in different situations than in the show, allowing for another kind of development and new approaches.The depiction of the world at war is more concrete, emphasising the fear instilled by firebenders and the brutality of the Fire Nation, who committed genocide. Unlike the show, where the seriousness is occasionally overshadowed by lighter moments and cartoonist comedy, here the gravity of the situation is consistently portrayed.Negative impressions:The episodes set in Omashu combine elements from three to four episodes in the show, resulting in some confusion and rushed conclusions. While attempts were made to include various subplots, as it's difficult to please everyone, people would miss the musicians from secret tunnel episode, for example, some elements felt rushed, but it's understandable.The absence of Aang consoling Hei Bai and reassuring that the forest will regrow over time was a notable omission. They probably had to cut it from the series for the sake of the episode length or rhythm.The princess Yue's wig.The training scene between Sokka and Suki missed the opportunity to explore Sokka's initial sexism, which is quickly destroyed as he witnesses the strength of the Kyoshi warriors. Instead, I feel they replaced it with a bit of arrogance, the focus is on setting up their future romantic storyline.Roku's limited appearance compared to the cartoon leaves much to be desired, but there's hope for more in future seasons, as some content from subsequent seasons were already adapted in the series.","rating":"9\/10","date":"25 February 2024"}
{"title":"What a fun ride!","review":"This show will be a nightmare for nitpickers, a thrill of a ride for nostalgic returning fans, an easter egg delight for die hard fanatics and a pleasurable journey for general audiences. I've had fun, genuinely. If you're looking for a live action clone then you may be disappointed.The acting is mostly decent. Members of the fire nation steal every scene with proficiency. There's also an overall increased emphasis on the Fire Nation and its motives in Book 1, a change I found refreshing. Zuko, Iroh, Azula, and Ozai are all true to form.The biggest con I would say is the acting of our main protagonist, Aangs delivery can feel a bit hallow and stalled at times, however as a child actor he's likely to get better in time and with development.","rating":"8\/10","date":"22 February 2024"}

{"title":"Overall great adaptation","review":"Coming from a person that has watched the original series so many times, I thinks this is very good adaptation. It is original in its own way, while remaining loyal to the main storyline and characters. Some of the best new things are scenes showing and developing some past events. There are some changes to the story and the adventures of the gang but those changes are mainly details - they don't contradict the main story line, which is very important for having the next seasons and to not disappoint us fans.The only thing that really annoys me is that instead of calling the nations by their name (Earth Kingdom, Fire Nation, Air Nation\/Nomads) they are calling them \"Fire Benders\", \"Earth benders\", etc... This not only takes their personality away but it makes the sensation that everyone is a bender and leaves questions such as what nation are Sokka or Suki?","rating":"9\/10","date":"23 February 2024"}

The actors are in a coma, I could act better, they have no feelings and when I watch them speak two sentences in every episode, I get uncomfortable because it is visible on their faces that the actors are also uncomfortable... which no one should be. The series is a disappointment, the 2010 avatar movie IS MUCH BETTER. The effects don't work here, especially at the beginning on the ice, everything looks fake, too fake.. it looks like the series is very cheap, I don't know if the problem is with netflix or what. Also the effects are not well blended and the plot of the series is very scattered.

Stop remaking things just for money, it's looks bad they didn't put the effort in to make it great, they just made it acceptabel enough so they can make money of the sheeps who don't have an own opinion or taste and just like the move from 2012 they are doing kung fu fights without bending, why because they didn't want to spend to much on visuals, stop harrasing the Anime World and just make series about a dude washing his car and going to work, for the average netflix watcher it's good enough for them.","rating":"1\/10","date":"22 February 2024"}
{"title":"Cough, cough","review":"Cough, cough, this live action is nothing but a shame for Avatar: The Last Airbender. It is a complete waste of time and money. I've never seen such a bad adaptation over a decade. The live-action version falls short in capturing the essence and magic of the original series.Overall, the live-action adaptation of \"Avatar: The Last Airbender\" has been widely regarded as a missed opportunity. Despite the potential to introduce a new generation of viewers to the rich and immersive world of bending, the adaptation ultimately fails to capture the magic and charm of its animated predecessor. As a result, it stands as a disappointing entry in the legacy of the beloved series, leaving fans longing for a more faithful and satisfying interpretation.","rating":"1\/10","date":"24 February 2024"}
{"title":"It's simply bad.","review":"All in all - it's really not worth eatching. We all can agree, that creating a good live-action adaptation of a cartoon is hard. But staying faithful to the source material cannot be that hard...Casting is bad, acting is bad, CGI is bad and mainly - the script is bad... It changes too many things at the same time. There are some pretty nice points (for example changing the opening lines and letting Gran Gran tell the original opening line when she explains Aang has to be last airbender and the Avatar). During the first episode where all the main characters are being introduced, you can see how much are the main character traits being shifted. Aang is arogant and talks too much about things that should have been left unspoken and just shown, Gyatso looks like a coward, Iroh is not that sweet old uncle, Katara isn't emotional and don't get angry with Sokka, mainly because Sokka acts too mature, even tho he is not supposed to be mature enough at this point of the story... The bending, oh god, horrible! Simply. No. Do not waste your time.","rating":"1\/10","date":"23 February 2024"}
{"title":"Below Average","review":"The latest Netflix live action adaptation and this time of one of my personal favourites, so warning probably went into this hypercritical. Following the Avatar, the last airbender in a world inhabited by four peoples each with the power of earth, wind, water, and fire respectively. Sealed in ice for 100 years after the Fire nation began its quest for world domination, the Avatar, sole master of all four elements, has returned as a child, hoping to bring peace and balance back to humanity. Covering the same scope as the original animated first season, this new series somehow feels very rushed, even though its total run time by my napkin math is only about an hour shorter in length. We spend each episode racing through plot, with favourite characters cherrypicked from throughout the original series and plopped in, and almost all dialogue is exposition. The CGI, especially on the elements themselves, is quite good, although notably fur on any animals looks awful. The acting is also quite bad, with really only the exception of Sokka, played by Ian Ousley, who nailed it, otherwise a lot left to be desired. There was a lot of mumbling through lines, to the point I had to turn on captions at points to know what was being said. It would be easy to rag on Aang, played by Gordon Cormier, but honestly I think its a difficulty of the character, you can't really have an MC child prodigy without casting a child prodigy to play him, so good luck with that. Aang is in many ways a live action role that's doomed to fail. That said, even many of the other castings were a let down, I was excited to see Paul Sun-Hyung Lee as Uncle Iroh, and while fine, I was disappointed. Kids will likely like it, but even for that demographic how it offers anything that the original series doesn't, I'm doubtful, which is still just as accessible, so just watch (or re-re-re-watch) that instead. Honestly my most controversial opinion is probably that while not terrible, its only a little bit worse than LoK.","rating":"4\/10","date":"26 February 2024"}

{"title":"Written and directed without atla understanding","review":"I'm sad to tell this is just another failed attempt of remaking a truly cinematic masterpeace. The writters of the original atla series had chosen every word, sentence and deeper meaning of the scenes very carefully. This atempt of milking the atla fanbase has not been more than a simple ctrl-C and ctrl-V of the most random scenes of the original. This adaptation has missed the simple essence of atla. I've missed the peace and balance of the storytelling. Every interaction between the actors feel rushed, awkward and without a real connection. For the original series the writters had studied different real world fighting styles and had chosen a style for each type of bending. Here the bending feels forced and without emotion.Just one star for the cabbage man.","rating":"1\/10","date":"22 February 2024"}

{"title":"Ruined by weired acting,shallow expression and abrupt jump in the screenplay","review":"It's disheartening to witness the live-action adaptation of the masterpiece \"Avatar: The Last Airbender\" (TV Series 2005-2008). The actor portraying Aang lacks acting skills, and the same can be said for the actresses playing Katara and Sokka. Their performances make me cringe. The only actors I appreciated were the ones playing Zuko and his uncle Iroh, but their abilities only stand out in comparison to the rest of the cast, not necessarily as commendable in their own right. They fall short of capturing even 50% of the original essence. The overall result feels half-baked, with cringe-worthy acting. I expected to be immersed in the story, but their performances consistently make me cringe. I would have given it a rating of at least 5, but due to the impact on my cherished childhood memories, I'm compelled to rate it a 1. I now feel the need to rewatch the original animation to cleanse my mind of the atrocities Netflix has committed.In terms of appearance, they may fit the characters, but in acting, they are the worst. The casting process should have considered both looks and acting abilities. Aang could have been portrayed as slightly older, avoiding the challenge of the actors growing too quickly. I understand the concern about actors aging, but better planning and superior performances, along with completing all three books or seasons in one go, could have addressed this issue. With a pre-existing written story, background score, and music, the focus should have been on delivering exceptional acting and visual effects. While the visual effects are not outstanding, they are still better than M. Night Shyamalan's \"Avatar.\" Overall, I am disappointed with the outcome.","rating":"1\/10","date":"22 February 2024"}

Better than the live-action movie. But wow! Shockingly bad. Wish they did it right by casting better and telling the full story, with the adventures, or continued the animated story instead.I could not be more disappointed in how this turned out.

{"title":"Is is what I wanted for ?","review":"Netflix seriously dropped the ball with their so-called adaptation of Avatar: The Last Airbender. I mean, how do you mess up something that was already perfectly written? The acting? Don't even get me started! Aang is just terrible, and who thought casting Sokka was a good idea? Where's his humor, huh? And why is everyone moving through the story at warp speed? We're missing out on all the juicy details and character development!Uncle Iroh was the only saving grace, but the rest of the cast? Total garbage. And what did they do to Tylee, Mei, and Azula? These fierce, kick-ass females turned into three overweight slobs who can't even move properly. And don't even get me started on the political correctness crap. Roku got sidelined for what? Tokenizing women? Give me a break!I'm beyond mad. Netflix had all the money in the world, and this is what they give us? It's insulting! As a woman, I'm doubly disappointed.

{"title":"Unnecessary changes to the story and characters are soulless","review":"I'm not one to usually write reviews but Atla was and is my favourite cartoon growing up, so I almost feel obliged. My issues with the live action are predominantly the drastic changes made to the storyline and the personalities of the character. I must admit storyline wise I am biased but I don't see how the changes benefit the show, the source material was flawless imo and could easily be transferable to the realism of live action. In regards to the main 3 characters Aang, Katara and Sokka, I feel as if the changes made to their character arcs (which we were warned of in advance) has made them void of any real personalities and the quality of the script doesn't help either. I could nit pick each and every episode of the show and write a very long list of what's wrong (imo) and how much they've deferred from the original, but ultimately all of that could have been forgiven if the creators had still maintained the soul of the cartoon, which I believe they've failed to do.","rating":"2\/10","date":"22 February 2024"}
{"title":"Definitely better than the movie","review":"Like I'm suggesting in the title, better than the movie.And although it follows (almost) every plot point of the last airbender, it's definitely way worse. They squished way too much together and there is so much going on in each episode. Like making important episodes happen all at once.We miss a lot of the character development because it seems like all they do is want to get to the final episode. We don't get a lot of conversations between them and I think that's a missed opportunity.I didn't need every episode in a lot of detail, but it seems like they didn't understand which episodes were more important than others (from the animated series). A few examples are getting through an original episode, which I consider a major plotpoint, within 5-10 minutes, and another which could have been 5-10 minutes takes an entire episode (and it still wasn't right).I did really enjoyed the first two episodes and the new azula plotline, but after episode 3 it became way too fast paced.I think my biggest mistake coming into this was expecting that the plotpoints would be allowed to grow more, as this is what I had read in an interview with the original creator. They don't.I will say though, and this is what mate my rating up to a 5\/10, the cgi and choreography is amazing.The acting is a little meh, there are some really talented actors and actresses, but some interactions feel forced.","rating":"5\/10","date":"23 February 2024"}
{"title":"Look how they butchered my boy","review":"After over 10 years of passively reading reviews and never once thinking about creating an account I decided to create an account to review this. Avatar: The Last Airbender (the original) might be one of the greatest shows ever created. Unfortunately this show fully lost the plot.These show writers clearly proved they never once watched one episode of the original or even read an overview for that matter. They took all the greatest themes of the original and made a horrible version of the beloved show. You would think that the show writers would understand \"hey this is a beloved show that has been talked about nearing two decades now, follow that theme\". But no, they decided to go their own route. People begged for a live action version of the show that they loved, and this is not the show that they loved.The casting choices alone are enough to make anyone stop watching. Aang's acting is far from the character he is supposed to be in the original, but the actor is trying his best so I won't fault a 15 year old who was given a mediocre script. Admiral Zhao on the other hand might be some of the worst acting I have ever seen. His cold demeanor from the original show is no longer there in this new adaptation.There is so much more I can say about this train wreck of a show but I don't think it's worth me taking the time to type it out. But hey, at least they got the bending cgi better than M. Night's disaster of a movie, it's clear that's all they were going for.","rating":"1\/10","date":"23 February 2024"}

And I honestly couldn't make it through the first 15 minutes.I did some research and turns out the original creators of the show left and it SHOWS. The bending in the animation is based off of martial arts styles and not just \"magic\". But in this it's like they just raise their arms and fire or air comes out. Additionally socka has no comic relief. And what was that Shakespearean monologue of aang talking to himself before he ran away? Where's the emotional payoff for that? How are other people liking this show is beyond me.

You would expect that a darker version of ATLA would have more impactful line delivery, but it just feels very weak. And then there's the CGI. Sure the fighting choreography is good and for the most part the element visuals look good, there are parts where it's distractingly poor. And what little attempts the show has at comedy is just weak. There are a lot of shows where I go into without knowing anything about it and have a good time watching it, not wanting to take my eyes off the screen.

{"title":"Well Done Netflix because this is very bad","review":"The biggest thing about the Avatar: The Last Airbender cartoon series is definitely its beautiful story, but thanks to Netflix, it has undergone changes in the story. The functioning of all the episodes and the characters we encounter are intertwined in a complex and messy way. For some reason, characters we know from many different places all appeared in Omashu. While the personalities of many characters changed, the Cave of Lovers also became the Cave of Siblings. The characters are very bad, some of the characters' appearances definitely do not resemble the original. With the exception of the episode on Kyoshi Island, none of them are beautifully done at all.

If \"Having the new generation meet with your childhood favorites\" is the purpose, then let the new generation experience the real thing, that is NOT all that old, and even it gets old, its timeless. No need for.... whatever billion dollars thrown into making the cleanest possible CGI. I'm enjoying how thirsty these people are for money, and they can't get good reviews that arent bots.

The majority of the main characters are talentless. And Gran Gran, who has teeth brighter than the future of this series, is...

I think it falls flat on the writing and casting department.It doesn't even feel like the main characters have seen the show and when the original ATLAB creators left the show because it wasn't in line with their 'vision' I finally know why.

Let me begin to say that while they did have \"better\" casting and effects most of the acting was mediocre at best. Some felt incredibly forced to the point that you felt second hand embarrassment in some scenes. I will admit there were a few moments that were touching and for those reasons I gave the extra star. Everything else felt so stale, rushed and thrown into 8 episodes leaving out some of the best moments in the show. Even the iconic phrases when mentioned gave no joy. That being said this adaptation fails to provide the same emotions we felt when watching the original series and while I understand that no one will ever come close to reaching the perfection that was ATLA, I wanted to believe that it can still focus on the values of enlightenment, connection, the importance of balance with nature and that faint glimmer of hope that each character had to push them forward. Instead we were given a version that focused only on the dark aspects of the show and man now I completely understand why the original creators walked away from this project. It took a lot to even finish this season but when I did I was left feeling empty.Do yourself a favor and just rewatch the animated series.","rating":"2\/10","date":"25 February 2024"}
{"title":"Not what I hoped for","review":"I really wanted to love the series. But as much as I'm sorry, the series is just bad. The costumes look like costumes and not real clothing. Some of the actors are bad, but mostly the characters are poorly written. Azula, for example, just seems like a stubborn child. Mai and Thai Lee are by her side from the beginning and support her. In the cartoon, Thai Lee was instead afraid of Azula and was indirectly blackmailed by her into helping her. The sets look really great from further away, but in the close shots everything seems fake, the light is artificial, the sets and the clothes are always way too clean. I particularly noticed the \"cleanliness\" negatively at the market in Omashu. The ground and the market stalls were licked clean, there was not even a hint of dirt anywhere. And the plot... there was just too much crammed into one episode and some storylines were unnecessarily changed and merged. At the same time, a lot was left out. Katara suddenly becomes perfect at waterbending after a single conversation (and before that, she was suddenly able to do it in an important situation, even though she always failed miserably at practice). Aang talks all the time about having to learn the other elements, but then doesn't practice waterbending once. And the humor that made the animated series so special is simply completely missing. There were individual scenes that I really liked and that would have enriched the original series. And the bending and the fights themselves are well done. But overall I'm just sad and disappointed.","rating":"3\/10","date":"5 March 2024"}
{"title":"Terrible. Don't ruin the classics","review":"Special effects are the only good thing in this Series.They ruined the whole emotion behind the Anime. No humor, love , friendship. Terrible performance.How could they remove the Fun of the whole series. The whole joy of Sokka was completely removed.So many amazing moments were made into one episode which ruined the whole show.As a fan of Anime I wish they have made enough research.Why did they introduced Azula and her friends in this season.

The characters, from how they're drawn to how they're portrayed, even as cartoons is literally perfect, the voices match perfectly, the art behind how every character is drawn and the continuity between each season is what makes it so you have fans, like myself, who hate to see this show butchered every couple of years.

Including story lines and plot points. If they would have taken more than 6 episodes it could have absolutely amazing. I get filler episodes aren't the most important but they absolutely give the characters meaning and progress. They give more to the story. I'm also not a fan with how they changed the characters. Katara and Sokka really don't have substance in this. I know you can't keep everything the same when remaking, especially with cartoon remakes. But they had really set the bar with A Series of Unfortunate Events. I'm gunna keep watching because I appreciate the new experience but I'm not holding hope for the story. It's worth a watch for the visuals.","rating":"5\/10","date":"25 February 2024"}
{"title":"Lifeless, stiff and a complete lack of depth","review":"I hold this IP in extremely high regard, the original show is perhaps my favorite show ever, which is also why i am so harsh in the review of this show.Fundamentally the writers do not understand avatar or it's characters, or why even after all these years the original is still beloved.The character assassinations is countless, Katara, Sokka, King Bumi, Yue, Azula, Pakku and Roku are all but cheap imitations.The acting across the board is quite dodgy, but i believe it all to be a problem that lies with the directing and writing. The show has a gigantic problem with exposition, it can not shut up and needs to explain things all the time. Seems like these writers have forgotten the golden rule of show don't tell.The pacing is horrible, everything feels rushed, its squeezed of any life and is not allowed to breathe and just exist in this world. The story changes are very questionable, and not even logical. Aang is not allowed to be a kid anymore, Aang wants to have fun and goof around but he takes it all so seriously all of a sudden. He is supposed to be 12 years old, but acts twice the age.I like some things however, the addition of the backstory to Zuko's crew was great. Daniel Dae Kim was incredible as Ozai. Even tho he was great, they showed too much of him, you don't get the same super villain aura that he has in the original.Also in a season where it is vital that Aang learns to master waterbending, he does not even attempt to waterbend once? In the whole season? The whole point of getting to the north pole in the original is so Katara and Aang can find a master to learn from. Yeah, that does not happen. Boils my blood.The show shoots itself in the foot with the duel between Ozai and Zuko. Zuko is a child, and Ozai is the ultimate super villain. Why do they show Zuko being at a point where he could have beaten Ozai but restrained himself? Holy mother of all things holy, that is such a dumb change.The flaws are many and great. It is also not horrible, as the kids say. It's just quite \"mid\", which is a damn shame when you are adapting something so incredible.","rating":"5\/10","date":"28 March 2024"}

{"title":"Missing necessary aspects for it to be objectively good","review":"The two ways people are going to evaluate this show are (1) how it improves upon and is informed by the original series, and (2) how well it stands on its own. In some ways, the show does well in the first sense. The visual effects are really well done, which is clearly an area other adaptations have failed, and it succeeds in making you feel like the physics of a fantasy series are possible in real life. I think it's easy to underestimate how important that is, because so many people have felt at one point or another like they wanted to be part of that universe. So I think there will be some reviews which blindly praise the show for accomplishing this, and that the show succeeds in being physically believable. Unfortunately, that is the lowest standard required for a production of this kind, valuable as it is. I don't think anybody would watch this show on its own. Mostly because the writing is so god awfully bad. The dialogue is unusually literal and assumes very little knowledge or subtext. The lines often feel condescending, which produces an inverse effect of the original show. Whereas the original show is perhaps overwritten given the target age of its audience, it matures well as the audience does. In this adaptation, we feel like the show has the opportunity to be darker and more human in an attempt to make a more \"adult\" version. But neither the acting nor writing match this opportunity because the dialogue might be what you'd expect a worse version of the original show to be: a children's book, almost like it was naively written by a large language model. If the original show looks like it was for 10 year olds but written for 30 year olds, this show looks like it should be for 30 year olds, but written for 8 year olds. The irony of this is that many people watched the original show when they were young, making the nature of the writing here especially insulting. The show also misses on the quirkiness of the many side characters, generally weak acting, and an over-adherence to the plotline. I think the casting from a visual standpoint was quite good, and the interpretation of Sokka is particularly good. Aang and Katara lack the life and energy we've come to know as there is very little personal eccentricity shown in either character; Iroh and Zuko seem like they just met. Although I think the acting is generally weak, I attribute this mostly to writing. There certainly could be a way in which the personalities are different from the original and the show succeeds, but there simply isn't enough texture of personality for that to be possible here. What this show needs are actually more \"filler scenes\" and dialogue which help to fill in the depth of interpersonal character dynamics. Instead we are left with a very literal adherence to plot, achieved by an even more literal kind of dialogue. The musical themes are the same, though not actually better than the original. This show is worth watching for those who want a credible way to visualize the world of ATLA, but expect none of the life, texture, wit, or messages which made the original version so great.","rating":"5\/10","date":"25 February 2024"}
{"title":"Cosplay????","review":"This is the first time I'm reviewing on IMDB, but damn I have to vent.. Apart from the fact that they rush the story, the acting that's forced, the bad casting, and the way they change how certain information is conveyed, by far the worst thing about this is the set design\/costumes. They look fake! Its as if they're all dressing up for Halloween. Nothing looks lived in, there's no authenticity, nothing real. Just CGI, and bad costumes. Honestly, if they would've used just a couple real locations, and used the correct materials for the costumes to make them look more real or like something actually used by the characters, the rest would've been able to be overlooked..The CGI works for the fight scenes, but whenever there's just dialogue, you just get the sense they're on set with green-screens. All the clothes are too clean, and look like the inventory of a Nickelodeon gift shop.The acting feels forced, and a lot more time should've been put into casting. In terms of the resemblance of the characters the ones that really were wrong imo, were Zuko and Iroh. They simply did not look right nor did they have the same gravitas in terms of delivery that the original character had.Honestly... I understand why the original creators ditched this production. It looks cheap, and like the people behind it had no motivation to actually bring the original show to life. Probably more a Netflix cash-grab than anything else. Put some people in charge that really care next time!","rating":"1\/10","date":"26 February 2024"}
{"title":"Completely Missed the point of the animated series","review":"Zero character development and completely missed the mark on what made the original series amazing. Im not saying that a live action cant make changes but the changes that were made only made many of the most impactful scenes less impactful or completely pointless. Filled with as much pointless exposition as a tv show can have. The show disrespects its audience by not allowing its characters to have flaws or any development as well as not allowing for any mystery for the audience to try and uncover. Very disappointing. No wonder the original writers left the show 4 years ago.

The writing is all over the place, especially the earth kingdom episodes with Bumi, and the dialogue is way too serious. Even Iro disappoints. In the animation, almost everything he says is filled with wisdom, and that just doesn't come across here.After watching Netflix' version of One Piece I had high hopes, but I've got to say they dropped the ball with this one.","rating":"5\/10","date":"10 March 2024"}

It's violent and not for kids, and it's poorly written, directed, and acted so it's also not great for adults. The writing was done by Chat GPT and caused the writers strike. This series is not very funny, and I'm pretty sure the best lines are improvised by Sokka as the acting feels different whenever a comedic moment arises and the camera is never quite framed for his line delivery. Zuko is also the only good performance in this series, but with bad writing does it even matter? Sometimes I believe he's not an actor when he's not talking. I'm also pretty sure that whoever wrote Uncle Iroh just read a reddit somewhere that Iroh likes tea. Really disappointing stuff. You shouldn't waste your time. Neat set design and VFX (sometimes), other times they didn't have enough budget to render realistic hair for Appa, or thought that airbending looked like a distortion layer in After Effects. Bending is a huge let down. Still convinced that the best bending battle in live action history resides with Albus Dumbledore and Lord Voldemort in the ministry of magic.

The acting is cringe, they do not show emotions and it feels like they are reading the script. The script is bad as they took everything that should have stayed and developed new things badly. The special effects are horrendous: water and air bending look fake, the background relies too much on the green screen, and Aang's flying and landing are laughable. The costumes are too much.

However, a friend of mine did watch it, and he said Aang could fly. This is totally wrong, because in the cartoon, Aang couldn't fly without his glider.

In this first section they've already missed out on a lot of smart things. What we got instead is plastic CGI fights and things that are were not even in the comics. I turned it off when Avatar Kyoshi goes badass, but I will avoid spoilers. What!? So many disturbing things. Without trying not to judge the actors, Sokka's character is written so bad, his sexism was part of his story that he was the oldest male left in his village, desperately trying to act like one, but that is just a role, therefore loveable. Offended by having beaten by a women and still seeking for her help is important for his development. Katara is nothing like the grown up for her age, mother like young girl, who always knows what to say or where to go. And the little, world building things... No yip-yip, Appa just flies for example.I am a cinematographer and VFX artist, so as far as the visuals go... it is too clean, lighting is unnatural as hell. Costumes are ok, borrowed from the series as it is. The one thing must have been optimzed for live action should have been that. It is war and everyone is beautiful and spotless.If you love the series and know it troughoutly, and expecting something that respects and most importantly understands the fundations of the comics, this Netflix series is not for you.

Second, they gutted the core fundamentals of what made the characters unique and likeable, there is just no soul to the portrayals. Third, it truly is rushed, there is never any build up to the next scene, they just teleport basically. It takes away from the fun of experiencing their journey to each of the nations. Like in the first episode they just showed up at the southern air temple it was just so random. I understand that it's not a scene by scene recreation but they also didn't need to try and cram everything into 8 episodes. It could have been a few more episodes.

The overall structure of the story, the plot, and the dialogue is lazy, convienent and elementary. The characterization is a bastardization of the cartoon. The only reason people are under the influence that this is good is simply because of nostalgia and that it is not the 2010 movie. Don't be fooled this is a joke of an adaptation.

No need to waste your time, better watch any original episode from 2005-2008 again if you want to preserve any good taste at all.It is hard to understand the need to change everything that was good to the point of boredom and meaninglessness, to recruit so-called screenwriters who miraculously choose the most uninspiring and worst from the abundance of already shown material, to hire actors who actually are not, all for the sake of an extra dollar earned.

It was a poor choice to try and show Azula as anything less than a psychopath with insane power. The changes to the story felt unnecessary. I don't understand why Aang had an obsession with his airbending master and had hardly any feeling toward the people fighting next to him. I could continue with tons of issues that I thought happened with the show. I will just sum it up and say I watched it all the way through and not even the last battle made up for how much I didn't care about any of the characters by the end. They needed to space out the seasons even though they didn't want to due to the kids aging out of their role.

{"title":"Not worth your time","review":"We're delving into a film that, frankly, challenges our patience from the get-go. Within the first 10 minutes, it becomes painfully clear that we're not just navigating a story, but also wrestling with performances that can only be described as laughably bad. This isn't just a minor hiccup in an otherwise smooth cinematic experience; it's a glaring issue that halts any suspension of disbelief right in its tracks.Such a stark lack of convincing acting isn't merely disappointing; it's a fundamental flaw that disrupts the entire narrative flow. When performances fail to capture the essence of their characters or the gravity of the storyline, the connection between audience and screen is severed. It's akin to being constantly reminded that you're merely an observer of a performance gone awry, rather than being immersed in a compelling narrative world.This problem points to a larger issue within the film: a disconnect between the vision and the execution. Great acting can sometimes salvage a weak script, just as a strong narrative can elevate average performances. However, when the acting is so profoundly unconvincing from the onset, it casts a shadow over the entire production, making it difficult, if not impossible, to engage with the story on any meaningful level.The early departure of any viewer, prompted by subpar performances, is a stark indicator of the film's failure to meet the basic expectations for storytelling and character development. It's a reminder that, at its core, cinema is an art form that relies on the believable portrayal of characters to engage, provoke, and move its audience. Without this foundational element, all other aspects of filmmaking risk falling flat, leaving viewers disengaged and, as in this case, compelled to walk away well before the story has a chance to unfold.\"","rating":"1\/10","date":"27 February 2024"}
{"title":"A soulless corporate cashgrab","review":"I have been a fan of ATLA ever since it came out in 2005. I was 6 years old and still have Great memories of watching it and obsessing over it with friends. Since then, it has remained my all time favourite show and i have rewatched it over 30 times.Sadly, this live Action adaptation does not live up to ATLAs legacy. Horrible exposition dumping, terrible dialogue, mediocre acting and visuals are sadly just the tip of the iceberg. Any nuance in the storytelling has been eradicated as the writers cant seem to write a scene without spewing exposition to save their lives. Removing the character arcs of everybody was also a baffling choice. The stakes feel low and the show is just insultingly dumb and boring Most of the time. Sadly just another soulless corporate cashgrab.","rating":"1\/10","date":"27 February 2024"}

Uncle iroh is selfish, unwise, and thoughtless. Their were critical moments in the animated show that led to later shows, that the live action completely missed. It is as if the director watched only a fraction of the animated series and decided to create a live action film. Examples are king bumi knowing aang, and aang not knowing it was king bumi until the \"game\" was over. Also the badger moles, secret tunnels, and katara and aangs moment.

{"title":"I want to forget it","review":"The original TV show is my favorite cartoon ever. So I was excited to wait for a remake from Netflix. I understood that the plot would be changed a bit, but I was waiting for a beautiful picture and cast.Finally, it was really challenging to watch the 1st episode to the end... It was so bad I couldn't even imagine. Okay, you changed the plot, changed some characters, but why did you make it so dry and hasty? It's especially unbelievable, when you find out that the new TV show and the original continue for the same amount of hours. All the scenes are flat, you don't feel with any of the characters, everything is happening in a hurry.But the main question is how could you make a TV show so cheap, ugly and unprofessional being the greatest streaming service in 2023? This is absolutely something you don't wait for from Netflix and from a remake of cult cartoon.And the deal isn't in comparison with the original, this is bad by itself.","rating":"1\/10","date":"6 March 2024"}
{"title":"What were they thinking?","review":"The perspective of someone who has seen the original a dozen times, but trying to watch this new series with open eyes.To begin, the story was rushed, focus was weird\/confusing most of the time, pacing was all over the place, it had below the bar humor that was awkwardly timed, and the character's personalities and demeanor were just off (doubt it was the actors' fault).The writing is probably the worst to come out of the show. I have no doubt it would be an okay series if it had good-great writing. Regardless, I loved seeing all the characters, animals, and locations come to life. Not to mention the fighting scenes. Top marks.However, even after distancing myself, this series was less than okay. Obviously Netflix didn't learn their lesson when it comes to destroying good material (the Witcher). Despite all that, you can tell a lot of people put a great deal of effort into making this a great one, and it shows. Too bad it wasn't everyone.","rating":"3\/10","date":"23 February 2024"}

Too bad the writers weren't up to par.They mashed up so many different episodes that are out of order that it makes no sense. They skipped on character development, which was the whole reason why the animiated show did so well. The characters story was what made the show great. But this stew of mixed episodes. A bit from here, a bit from there and a dash from season 2...They ruined the Omashu arc, the ruined the meeting and reason for going to see the fire avatar.","rating":"3\/10","date":"25 February 2024"}
{"title":"Pretty f*king awful","review":"I went in with very low expectations and still ended up disappointed. Some of the worst acting and writing I've ever seen. It feels like there was no love or care that went into this project. All of the characters fall very flat, every single one of their faults from the original show is practically erased leaving no room for any sort of character development further down the line. I will say that the settings and creatures look good and they did manage to capture the original look and costumes, but a lot of the wigs look cheap and stiff. Overall, I just ended up feeling very frustrated at things that could have been easily fixed.","rating":"2\/10","date":"25 February 2024"}
{"title":"An inane waste of money","review":"I could only stomach two episodes of this show before I had to turn it off.I'm honestly surprised to see the praise this show is getting. Even without the comparisons to the original, the show is poorly paced, edited, and written.There is almost no time spent developing the characters or bonds, and the dialogue is stiff and cheesy. The episodes are all close to an hour long, but seem to crawl along at a sickeningly slow pace while also neglecting to lay the groundwork for later scenes. The editing is jarring and busy, and there are random Dutch angles thrown in all over the place without any care. Some of the bending scenes are cool, but most have lazy choreography that don't match up with the effects.There is a scene in the beginning where a woman is just spinning a wind tornado with no one around her to even get hit(?) by it, and then Fire-Lord Sozin shoots fire at her and she just keeps spinning while she burns alive.As a longtime fan of the original, the show is even worse. Events are mashed up and moved around, and have key details omitted that completely change the plaintext of the narrative.Why do they still go to the southern air temple when Aang already knows that they are all dead? Why does Aang need to learn to control the avatar state when he does so in the very first episode? In the original, Katara is the one that gets Aang to calm down, which demonstrates how much she cares for him and how little control he has over his ability.Also how do they seemingly teleport from the south pole to the southern air temple in a single scene? There is no weight to the party's journey because everything happens instantly without any travel time, and the audience loses out on valuable character moments!Why do all of the main characters seem to lack the flaws that they grow out of in later seasons? Characters without arcs are a mark of childish screenwriting, irrespective of the source material.Moving Aang's backstory to the beginning of the show destroys the subtle heartbreak of the death of monk Gyatso, and undermines Aang's internal fear of being a coward; which isn't an internal fear anymore, by the way. Every character openly accuses Aang of being a coward for no reason at all.I have seen a lot of reviewers saying that the Netflix adaptation is more 'mature' and for 'older audiences' but the writing has taken a steep nosedive in complexity and maturity in favor of corny scenes of people being burned alive.It feels like a digested paste of the original that seems to completely misunderstand every fundamental piece of Avatar: The Last Airbender's characters, world, and purpose.Don't bother, unless you want to torrent it and laugh at how bad it is.","rating":"1\/10","date":"23 February 2024"}
{"title":"Watch the the cartoon, do yourself a favor","review":"Netflix with all its money and power couldn't even do the bare minimum when copying someone else's homework for a passing grade.Lets start with the good. The score\/music, the costume design, and the scene design (yes even the CGI landscapes) were quite good. They do have a few neat ideas with regards to changes to the plot and key events but sadly they are half baked. It is fairly mindboggling this half commitment to explore a new angle to enhance the world building and characters. Sadly, the spirit world with all its visual weirdness and creativity was replaced with a generic dream\/forest place. It's like the budget and effort went into making this thing look close to ATLA versus the writing, acting and direction.On that note. For a series famous and loved for it's characters and their great personal stories and inspiring character growth; this amalgamation of exposition and lore dumps pays no respect to the source material and negatively impacts dialogue and any interest for the audience to engage.Sokka, Katarra and Azula are particularly insidious. Azula went from being a vicious and cunning girl boss to unoriginal anxious brat desperate for her fathers approval. Katarra is now perpetually anxious and unsure of herself removing any agency and determination to assert herself and express the rest of her personality. Sokka in this iteration is a small upgrade from the soulless husk from the shyamalan movie. The leader, inventor, plan maker and comedic soul of team avatar deserves better. Many of the other characters feel wrong and awkward, including Aang.Something as simple as having a unique martial art for each bending form is not even present. Without that visual distinction all the elemental bending may as well be generic martial arts in a low quality movie. Almost every action\/fight scene looks sluggish and amateur compared to the kinetic and bombastic delightful scenes from the cartoons.Please watch the cartoon, and please support keeping creatives and good story tellers in our entertainment. The original creators of ATLA left this project for a reason and it's obvious prioritizes little above profitability.","rating":"4\/10","date":"25 February 2024"}
{"title":"Good Character Development and Storyline Undercut by Poor Acting","review":"A compelling plot with deep character development and striking graphics may be found in \"Avatar: The Last Airbender (2024)\". The series lacks depth and realism in its acting, despite these positive aspects. There are instances that seem forced or unconvincing because the actors find it difficult to truly inhabit their roles. The poor acting takes away from the entire viewing experience even though the story and world-building are compelling. Despite this drawback, the show's complex narrative twists and compelling character interactions keep viewers interested. The storyline of \"Avatar: The Last Airbender (2024)\" is engaging overall, but the poor acting leaves some viewers wanting more from the ensemble.","rating":"5\/10","date":"2 March 2024"}
{"title":"They ruined Iroh and everything else.. Soulless, lazy, bad","review":"My problem isn't with any story changes. It's bad dialogue and bad line delivery. While watching the first episode I was pulling my hair out. Grandma exposition is the worst, a complete waste of a character explaining things we will learn eventually anyway.The story is fine it makes sense to change the story and timeline due to aging actors.Ignoring story, the execution awful it lacks substance.I'm just judging it on quality as a stand alone series The only comparison I'll make to the animation is they took Iroh one of the best characters and completely changed his personality making him a fire nation sympathiser in some scenes? And the actor doesn't give a single quality performance for even 5 seconds.The only positives. 1. Aang is a passable character, the actor isn't doing a bad job. He's doing what I expect from a child actor and actually stands above everyone else's phoned in performances. 2. The cgi is great and fighting\/bending is fine, not great, but not awful.The dialogue is horrible, it's 90% exposition speaking directly to audience like we're 2 years old. It feels like watching Dora the explorer. It actually reminds me of short films i'd watch in school for learning a foreign language. The lines actually feel like dumbed down exposition for people learning to speak English.If you like the animation and looking for a comparison:\nAnimation\/Netflix Live Action\nSokka: Young and hot headed with a \"women aren't warriors\" complex that learns through actions that he should respect others but a competent leader from the start who by the end of the first episode changes his mind from protecting Katara and the village to taking Katara to Aang.\/This new Sokka moans continuously about how helping Aang is a bad decision. Even after they've already been travelling for days?? Like seriously you've (the writers) already committed the characters to their journey he should be past this conflict. And if you want him to be conflicted: MAKE HIM CONFLICTED, they should be discussing what they're doing.Katara: is changed from an active character who is strong willed, stands up to Sokka and is the reason Aang is freed from the iceberg to a passive character. I honestly can't tell you one meaningful thing she does (partly because I'm enraged listening to everyone speak but that doesn't mean i'm wrong). Katara is shown to be a gifted water bender in the animation: when she is enraged and not thinking about her actions she produces some impressive attacks but she still has to learn: Katara discovers Aang through a massive water bending strike when she is angry with Sokka but then later on Zukos ship she is nervous\/scared and tries to strike a soldier but instead accidently freezes Sokka. In this new live action even when the music swells and we're supposed to be impressed Katara is hilariously bad\/slow and underwhelming.Zuko goes from a competent and actually intimidating villain to a whiny brat. Zuko has his teenage moments in the animation and he is played for laughs but he is also menacing, honorable when Aang goes with Zuko willingly and Zuko does not attack the water tribe and competent like during his Agnai Kai with Zhao. Live action Zuko is a whiny brat not a competent teenager who has faults but a 6 year old who throws a tantrum every other scene (for a while at least)\nIroh goes from wise and patient clearly not 100% behind the fire nation as he is shown to be passive and his only real actions are in Zukos interests not the fire nation. There is subtext. This like action is portrayed as a fire nation royalist until like the third episode?? I'm struggling to remember specifics but watch it and pay attention and you'll see what I mean. In the animation iroh barely speaks in the first few episodes and is careful with his words. In the live action Iroh is just an exposition machine: zig zagging to \"HAIL FIRE NATION\" what the writers think are \"wise words\" which are actually soulless exposition to when he speaks to Aang and is suddenly the wise uncle\/double agent but again what the writers think are \"wise words\" is just more soulless exposition with equally soulless delivery from the actor (roughly)My main point: What is done, is not done well. Regardless of previous Avatar content. If this did not have the \"Avatar the last airbender\" brand it would be absolutely demolished in reviews.","rating":"2\/10","date":"26 February 2024"}
{"title":"not just bad \"compared to the original\"","review":"Truly one of the most embarassing series I've ever watched. Every single nuance of the original is lost. Netflix seems to think that animation is for kids and then proceeds to write a series that feels like it was written by an 11 year old, how did they manage that? Everything needs INSTANT payoff in the netflix version, nothing is set up for the future, characters are simply incapable of character development because they're quite literally perfect from the very first second they're showed on screen.Aang growing from being a kid who gets distracted by everything: completely nonexistant in this adaptation, he is the absolute perfect hero from the second he is shown.Katara growing from not being capable of waterbending to the best waterbender by using hard work across several episodes of the series: No, we can't risk having character development in a netflix show, just have her get the scroll to bypass all of the boring stuff!Sokka growing from being sexist through character development and being showed that is not as superior as he thinks: No way! We can't show characters being the least bit non perfect in a netflix show, in fact just ruin his character entirely by replacing his character development by just falling in love instead, that'll do wondersThe only good thing this adaptation did is make people find out how much better the original is, despite animation being \"for kids\" in the eyes of netflix executives. One day we might get an adaptation of Avatar which doesn't dumb down the source material, but today is not that day, this is truly an embarassment not just to the source material but to showwriting as a whole.","rating":"2\/10","date":"28 March 2024"}
{"title":"disappointed, but not surprised","review":"Beautiful sfx, solid casting, and incredible set design fails to save the the rest of this show's overwhelming mediocrity. In all fairness: I think that a good live action adaptation that provides something fresh while still pleasing fans would be close to impossible for this show. The original show is truly so good with so little room for improvement that a cash grabbing live action adaptation is destined to leave true fans disappointed.From Katara's neutered personality to Sokka's lack of a genuine character arc, I was very disappointed in the changes to the characters' stories. I understand that this is a different version of the beloved original characters, but they fail to introduce anything new or interesting in place of what they removed. Katara went from a strong, complicated female role model to a sad blank slate of barely motivated side character. Sokka lost his initial misogyny and ignorance, making him a vaguely agreeable cookie cutter forgettable comedic relief. As many before me have said, taking away his bad traits robs him of room to grow and learn.Finally, I do not appreciate how overly expository the dialogue is. There consistently is no room for mystery or implication, because everything is instantly overexplained the moment it is introduced. It truly feels like directors and writers nowadays think that the average family show or movie needs to be written for people without brains.I appreciate the actors and effects artists for putting forth good work considering what they were given. Past that, I was not impressed. I do not plan to recommend this show to friends anytime soon.","rating":"5\/10","date":"14 March 2024"}
{"title":"Avatar the Last Bore","review":"First, I want to say I really wanted this to succeed. Not only as a redemption for the early 2000's rendition ( I dare not speak its name) but for a love of the show. I've been around since you had to wait for the episode on Nick, and I feel so very bored with it. When I saw the preview I thought, \"this is it, they're really doing it.\" And it looked good! The CGI, solid, the costumes, on point, Asian representation, sweet; it really had the setup to be epic. BUT, and a big but the characters and casting are just boring. I don't know if it's the writers, director, actors or all three, but they are all flat in their performance. There are no highs and lows in their acting, just flat. Aang is suppose to be jovial, funny, light hearted and they made him unbearable to be around and I don't think he even laughed, why so serious?! Then he goes into the drawn out monologue thats still is flat. Sokka, is probably a solid 75%, Katara, she's fine, but man where are the jokes!? Zhao, you might as well have not even casted him, what even was that rendition?! I could get past some of the storyline junk if it would have been entertaining. Thank the great spirit it wasn't in theaters because I found myself fast forwarding through the dialogue because by the end, who cares, I just want to see it end and say I watched it. I'm surprised that Netflix is moving along with 2 and 3. I very much hope they go back and actually watch the show and fix the acting. I've seen the kids(actors) in interviews and they are happy and joke around, but yet we leached joy and fun out of them in their performance... I don't understand how you can mess it up, it's already made, it's already dialogued, just make it live action, and keep it entertaining. It's so dramatic in a way you just roll your eyes and turn it off. I had high hopes, but instead we're left with a shell of what could have been, which is just disappointing.","rating":"5\/10","date":"13 March 2024"}

{"title":"The script writing is beyond awful.","review":"There was never any chance that they would pull off an excellent recreation of ATLA. However, they could have done a good one. This isn't even that.The Good -\nCGI: It is very good, better than the trailers, which is odd. The bending are properly done, they are actually quite believable.The scenery: It is also very, very high level and i actually dare say it is something they improved upon the original. Every scene is much richer in both amount of detail and quality, so this was a great thing to see.The ok -\nActors: I think they are quite bland. Sokka's actor stands out as the best of a pretty average bunch. What is incomprehensible is the casting in terms of appearance, specially for Azula, Ty Lee and Mai. Azula's appearance is a major part of her character and they completely destroyed it.The bad-\nThe script writing: I think this script should be used as a template of how NOT to write scripts. Everything is predictable, everything is a clich\u00c3\u00a9, everything is completely forced and unnatural.The plot: Simply put, they lost it.

{"title":"Stopped at the Third Episode, Now I'm Watching the Original","review":"As a huge fan of the original series, I wanted to like this version, but I heard that the original writers left the production, so I had very low hopes. Unfortunately this show did not exceed expectations.The good: I will say the costume design was great - very true to the original. I believe that Aang and Sokka were well-casted. The actress for Katara has potential to be a good fit, but it's hard to tell since they butchered her character so much. That's it for the good.The bad: The writer's seem afraid of giving the characters any of their original faults, leading to flat characters with no potential for growth. Sokka's sexism becomes a growth point and place of humility. Katara's battle against the sexism from Sokka and waterbenders in the northern water tribe is a major plot point for her and shows her grit. Sokka is also tells a lot of jokes, and not always in a sarcastic way. Katara is a type-A caregiver. These traits\/storylines were completely absent in this remake. The episodes seems sloppily jumbled together to fit all the source material into a shorter season. The Omashu episode is where I gave up because they combined characters from 3 episodes into one (Jet, Boomie, and the technology refugees). The Kyoshi Island episode was also strange - missing much of the original story line and bringing in avatar Kyoshi with an odd portrayal and one that did not occur in the original. Iroh's character was just awful and Zuko seems off in some way. The set also appeared too cartoonish on occasion, potentially an homage to the original, but looks off putting.Sadly, I do not think I can keep watching. Not sure how OG fans can get on board with this one.","rating":"4\/10","date":"8 March 2024"}
{"title":"Missed Opportunity","review":"MINOR SPOILER ALERT BELOW:I really wanted to like the show, I had high hopes. Let's set aside the general overarching misses that included a poor cast and bad acting, and let's start with what we know...this has been a beloved animated series for years and it deserves a better live adaptation than the one we received.I'll begin with the characters. First, Aang is the playful kid with a pension for finding fun more than pursuing his training, for a whopping five minutes in this show. Somehow he becomes super wise in a short time, giving Katara sage wisdom that helps her improve her water bending. Remember the episode where we meet Bumi in the animated series? Instead of King Bumi giving him a necessary lesson that challenges Aang's thinking, Bumi is instead \"taught\" by Aang at the end of the live episode version, who is only able to win with help from Katara and Sokka.I actually got irritated all over again thinking about this series that I can't even list all the character and plot issues, but I will say that Azula should not have been portrayed as a jealous little girl without control (yet), Kyoshi did not communicate with irritation and force, Jet was not in Omashu trying to bring it down instead of a small village, and June did not flirt with uncle Iroh...it was the other way around.I expected that in condensing 20 episodes (animated) in season 1 to 8 (live) we would see some storylines omitted, but based on the transference of time from 22-25 minute episodes to 45-50 live episodes, we wouldn't be missing much. I was wrong. Not only did we get omissions, we got warped storylines. It's bothersome.Appa and Momo were good.","rating":"3\/10","date":"4 March 2024"}
{"title":"Failure to justify it's own existence","review":"While it may not be a BAD show, it is not a good show either. Even if you don't compare it to the original, it is still a very, very mid show. None of the characters have any substance and I am so sick of these shows treating the audience like we're stupid. The entire show is just exposition and characters repeating same lines again and again. The colors are dull and writing is atrocious. There is not a singular character that you can feel passionately for. Creativity is at a zero. Your characters don't have to spell out that they are good friends multiple times if you just show us in their actions. The original show is pretty much the closest a show a get to perfection. There is not a single character that doesn't leave a great impact. The new show feels like people are just cosplaying the characters. These are not the same characters. The changes made in the plot line feel mediocre at best and unnecessary and straight up garbage at worst. Ultimately, it is a show that will just exist in the vast pool of average shows. Not a show that will swing the pendulum on either side. Fortunately, the source material remains and it definitely has stood the test of time. I am going to rewatch it again to wash off all the disappointment.","rating":"5\/10","date":"3 March 2024"}
{"title":"A very poor rendition!","review":"As a family we had high expectations and we were waiting for this to come out for at least a year.. 15 minutes in and everyone was asking to switch to a different show.The dialogs are so unnatural and altogether dumb, like Aang telling his Bison (and the audience) how he feels. There are so many better and natural ways to do this. The show does not decide if it wants to have a more realistic feeling (like some initial scenes) or more of a na\u00c3\u00afve look (like the perfectly clean and tidy wardrobe of the north village). The acting, perform by young actors is very poor. Sometimes, they rise to the occasion, not this time. I'm sure they'll gro into their characters.All this come down to the show runners and director. I'm still baffled at how a great source material and a big budget can still produce a lousy outcome. It makes me more appreciative of those instances when they do it right.","rating":"3\/10","date":"25 March 2024"}

I was expecting this to be a live action series of the 2005 animated series not the 2010 live action movie. I've watched the series 4 times and working on a 5th just to forget about this one. The one good thing that I can say about this series is that the voices were similar. Voices are not enough to keep us wanting more.When the original creators of the animated series left this project they should have stopped it all together and just took the loss. The person who took over as the showrunner must have based it off the movie and it shows. This franchise has so much potential for a GREAT live action and they did not do it any kind of justice. If you want to make a good version they could follow the animated series almost word for word! It's that great and this is not!! Please do not do a second season! Don't even do a redo. Why doesn't everyone just let the animated series live as the sole survivor?! And don't say for the money cause we all can see it's being wasted!If you are a fan of the original animated series and want several hours of disappointment then it's worth the watch otherwise rewatch the animated series and know it's the best version of ATLA you will see!","rating":"3\/10","date":"13 March 2024"}
{"title":"What is the point of this adaptation?","review":"Throughout viewing the 8 hours of Netflix's adaptation of the animated series, I kept asking myself \"why should I care about any of this?\" That is not something I thought even once while watching all 3 \"books\" of the animated series. It's puzzling as to exactly what the team behind this adaptation was trying to convey and why they thought their decisions would create a quality end product. The result is a total mess.First, some positives. The casting was excellent, some uncanny. Firelord Ozai and Zuko are exceptional casting choices. What many may call poor acting I believe is lack of support. The talent of many of these actors\/actresses is apparent but their skills are clearly squandered through ham-fisted writing, take-selection, and overall poor direction.Costume design was great (very true to the animated series). The only exception to costumes I can think of is those horrible wigs on Ty Lee, Mai, and Princess Yue. CGI was very cool to see, particularly in fight scenes. One scene that stands out is Zuko fighting as the Blue Spirit on top of the wall. It was an exhilarating fight scene aided by CGI.Now the nitty gritty. Did the Netflix preview screening go well? Did they stand up and clap? You would think they would be nervous about releasing this thing, but then again it's Netflix.This 8 episode series is a confusing mess, even for someone who has seen the source material! If you are unfortunate enough to watch this without any idea of the movie or animated-series, you will be left bewildered as to what in the hell is going on. The pacing is absolutely atrocious. You are shipped from one place to another so quickly that you lose all sense of exactly where you are, who these people are, and why you should care about their somehow simultaneously bloated and empty monologues. The fantasy, wonder, and appeal of the original series is ruined by trying to cram as much fan-service as they feasibly can into a convoluted, constantly shifting plotline.Speaking of fan-service, if the point of this adaptation was to appeal to fans, why mess with the script so carelessly? They could have followed the animated series identically and this would prove a treat for the fans. They get to see the series portrayed in live action with cool special effects. This also does not detract from the careful character building that is integral to the animated series' success to begin with.If the point is to get the attention of new viewers..I don't even know where to start because this adaptation is such a fast-paced, jumbled mess that it often times feels like a fever dream. It is unlikely that a first-time Avatar viewer could watch this series without thinking it to be bizarre and confusing.If the point was to appeal to both, which I believe is the intention behind the adaptation, then congratulations. You have the worst of both worlds.","rating":"3\/10","date":"28 February 2024"}

{"title":"Mediocre in a vacuum, but lost so much from the original","review":"I started out enjoying it more than expected. I don't even mind some of the story changes, and understand that some stuff wouldn't translate to live action, especially the shortened runtime of this version. But after 3 episodes I was extremely disappointed with the complete shift in tone, and the extremely different portrayal of certain characters, mainly katara who they really ruined here. I actually think the actor playing sokka is by far the best, and seems to have actually tried to do their character justice, exhibiting more cartoonish expressions and nailing some of the tone. Though they completely lost his character ark. He starts of with a very adolescent, boyish sexism in the animated series, but is constantly being made a fool because of it, and starts to see the error in his ways. It's actually good character growth, and here they just pretend sexism doesn't exist, because that solves things. And it's not just growth that's missing, the writers left very little if any of the joy and comedy from the original, and seemed to being going for the teenage angst drama fantasy crowd. Let's go back to Katara, who in the animated series is more of a mom figure to her older brother, is very passionate and outspoken, and honestly the main driving force for moving the story forward, and in my opinion the actual main character of the show. Here she's timid, soft spoken, and just sort of along for the ride. I honestly have no clue what they were thinking, especially nowadays when strong female characters are pushed for, and it was already written for them. They also butchered iroh, who is such a great character, and hilarious. Where is the comedy?! And that's just looking at what they did to the story. Oh boy the camera work is awful.I stopped watching mid 5th episode shortly after I realized 90% of the show is close up shots on individual characters, just back and forth. Seriously, once you see it, you can't unsee it. Go watch the first 3 or 4 episodes of the original, they have some awesome framing, and interesting perspective shots. It's a beautiful interesting world full of magic and this show is shot like a early 2000's TV drama. I couldn't believe it took me 4 episodes to realize how boring the shots were. I was hung up on their character changes, and didn't notice how little of the world they were showing. It's a great show if you want to appreciate how good the original was. Go watch that.","rating":"3\/10","date":"29 February 2024"}
{"title":"Superficially Amazing but soulless and empty inside.","review":"After watching the first episode my hopes were high as it mostly remained true to the source material with some extra scenes.Sure it suffered from some issues with telling instead of showing but was otherwise fine and a pretty good introduction, but this would not last.After the second episode I lost hope as they removed Sokka's arc of learning not to be sexist and instead replaced it with Suki having some weird crush on him for some reason. Sure this isn't something that would kill the entire show but I think it was a red flag for things to come as the characters remain mostly stagnant for the entire rest of the show.Episode three is just a jumbled mess of different episodes from the first season\/book and they completely butchered Bumi and showing how Aang feels about the world he left behind.Comedy is also just completely missing from the show, the only thing we get is some forced laughter from time to time.The show is visually stunning and the acting is very good but it's just not enough to save it from it's other glaring issues.Final word, just watch the original.","rating":"3\/10","date":"26 February 2024"}
{"title":"Better than M. Nights disaster but still not great.","review":"As others have already noted it's a pale comparison to the original animated series. All of the joviality of the original characters is completely lacking, and the dialogue can be extremely cringe at times and forgettable at the best moments. Only redeeming quality was the decent CGI and fights scenes. Came across as a bad soap opera with some violence interspersed. The whining of several of the characters and the portrayal of excessive timidity of others did a disservice to the original writers. I get that new directors love to take creative license - and granted this version was truer to the original series than M. Nights flop - but still...","rating":"5\/10","date":"6 March 2024"}
{"title":"A Catastrophe in Animation","review":"Avatar: The Last Airbender, a beloved masterpiece of animation, has been tarnished beyond recognition in its 2024 adaptation. What was once a beacon of storytelling excellence has been mangled into a grotesque mockery of its former self, a soulless cash grab that sacrifices the very essence of the original series for the sake of pushing vacuous new ideas. This abomination of a rendition is not just disappointing; it's a slap in the face to fans who held the original series dear to their hearts.First and foremost, let's address the sacrilege committed against the core plot points of the original series. The 2024 adaptation shamelessly removes or mutilates some of the most crucial elements that made Avatar: The Last Airbender an iconic saga. The entire narrative foundation is shattered, as if the creators gleefully stomped on the legacy built over years of painstaking storytelling.Gone are the nuanced character developments that made Aang, Katara, Sokka, and Zuko so relatable and compelling. Instead, we're handed hollow, one-dimensional caricatures devoid of the depth and growth that defined the original characters. Aang's journey to master the elements and grapple with his destiny is reduced to a mere afterthought, buried under the rubble of poorly conceived subplots.Butchering the characters is just the tip of the iceberg. The 2024 adaptation callously discards pivotal plotlines, stripping away the heart and soul of the series. The intricate exploration of bending arts and their cultural significance is sidelined in favor of gimmicky new powers and flashy but substanceless battles. Where once we marveled at the profound spiritual teachings of the original series, we're now subjected to cheap thrills and mindless spectacle.And let's not even get started on the egregious rewriting of the epic showdown between Aang and Fire Lord Ozai. In a baffling display of incompetence, the creators opt to replace this climactic battle with a contrived conflict that feels more suited to a Saturday morning cartoon than a saga of this caliber. The emotional weight and moral complexity of Aang's struggle to uphold his principles are discarded in favor of cheap shock value and nonsensical plot twists.But perhaps the most unforgivable sin committed by the 2024 adaptation is its blatant disregard for the themes of balance and harmony that lie at the heart of Avatar: The Last Airbender. The original series masterfully wove together elements of Eastern philosophy, environmentalism, and social justice to create a narrative that resonated with audiences of all ages. In contrast, the 2024 adaptation clumsily shoehorns in trendy but ultimately hollow themes that ring hollow and preachy.It's abundantly clear that the creators of the 2024 adaptation have little respect for the source material or its fanbase. Instead of honoring the legacy of Avatar: The Last Airbender, they've chosen to exploit it for profit, discarding everything that made the original series a timeless classic in the process. This egregious misstep serves as a grim reminder of the dangers of corporate greed and artistic laziness run amok.In conclusion, the 2024 adaptation of Avatar: The Last Airbender is an utter travesty, a soulless husk of a once-great series that has been twisted beyond recognition. By stripping away the most important plot points and themes of the original series in favor of vapid new ideas, the creators have committed an unforgivable betrayal of the fans who cherished the original saga. This abomination of an adaptation deserves nothing but scorn and derision, consigned to the annals of history as a cautionary tale of what happens when greed triumphs over artistry.","rating":"1\/10","date":"23 February 2024"}

Hybrid abominations of the original episodes? Checkity-Check! Unnecessary drama as to feign plot? Check! Bad directing with too many close ups? CHECKY CHECKY BANG BANG! Air bending that's not really air bending but more like levitation bending? C H E C K. This is so sad, cause I came in wanting to like it. They destroyed a masterpiece.","rating":"1\/10","date":"24 February 2024"}
{"title":"High hopes shattered by story shortening and character changes","review":"I can't believe it. The cast fits, the effects when bending look good, even Appa and Momo look acceptable. I really hoped it would be good. I even thought episode 1 was really good, but after that it goes downhill.What happened to our beloved characters?Where is the childlike nature of Aang? That's his main character, but in LA he's just doubting himself.Where is Katara's fire? In the animated series, she's known for her little freak-outs. They're part of her character, but in the LA it's completely missing. Also a scene where she is jealous of Aang's waterbending skills is completely missing.Sokka is originally sexist in the first season. How can you take that away from him and his whole development? THIS IS AN IMPORTANT POINT IN HIS MEETING WITH SUKI.Speaking of Suki. Why was she portrayed so weakly? She's a strong warrior who brazenly stands up to Sokka and makes a fool of him. Sokka's whole development was destroyed in episode 2 of LA. Likewise, why did Suki take off her make up? It ruined one of the funniest scenes from season 2 (Where Sokka sees Suki without make-up for the first time. And she reminds him of the kiss)Why is Kyoshi Island so negative towards Team avatar? They're like heroes in the animated series. After all, their whole island is named after Avatar Kyoshi. It makes no sense!Let's move on to Omashu. What the hell are Jet, Teo and the mechanic doing there? I understand the need to save time, but wtf? Did I get that right that Jet wanted to kill Bumi? Jet hates the fire nation and wanted to flood a fire nation village and NOT KILL AN EARTH KING.Why is Sokka talked into becoming an engineer instead of a warrior? Why is Hakoda suddenly portrayed as a father who doesn't believe in his son? Hakoda was always proud of Sokka. It's really not nice to see a loving father being dragged through the mud like this. Sokka is clever and an inventor, yes. But he's also a warrior.Bumi... where should I start? Why is Bumi taking Iroh prisoner? They are allies, as we know in season 3. Why does Aang recognize Bumi directly. The 3 challenges are there for fun. Bumi always had fun in his head and that things are not what they seem. But in the LA, that was completely lost. It seemed more like confusionLove tunnel without romance scene of Aang and Katara? But the writers already know that Aang and Katara's slow burn romance is part of it, right? By the way, Aang's feelings for Katara are not to be found for a second.Spirit World, Avatar Roku and The Blue Spirit were also brought together. Why were Katara and Sokka in the spirit world? What happened there? Why did it happen? Why exactly were they freed? I HAVE NO IDEA. I don't understand why it was made so complicated. The main theme of environmental destruction (which is why the ghost was angry) is completely lost. I also don't think there's any mention of what the comet is all about.I was already at a point where I was longing for the end. But I had hopes that my beloved North Pole scene with the water spirit would at least be good. That's why I kept watching.Yui is a beautiful and elegant princess in the animated series. Sokka quickly falls in love with her. But in LA, she doesn't seem like a princess to me. The North Pole actually serves as a huge contrast to the South Pole (in one everything is noble and beautiful, the other is small and familiar). But my mood was completely ruined when I heard that the engagement between Yui and Han doesn't exist... HELLO?! THIS IS A HUGE PART OF SOKKA'S STORY! Yui falls in love with Sokka, even though she was actually engaged. This starts a kind of power struggle between Han and Sokka. But this was also taken away from us in LA. Sokka was even called a great warrior by Han. Sorry, but how can you skip so much on emotion and story?Well, the big fish-spirit fight was destroyed by too much dialog. Instead of goosebumps, I wondered when it would finally be over. The info that Aang is suddenly stuck in the ghost was new to me and somehow I find it uninteresting. You have a great moment where the 12 year old suddenly cleans up the ice land like a berserker. Our beloved Yui dies. THERE'S NO NEED FOR MORE DRAMA. Why not stick to the normal story? It's good enough.But the thing that bothers me the most about Aang is the waterbending. IT'S NOT THERE! The first season of the cartoon series is called BOOK 1: WATER. So season 1 is about Aang learning waterbending. In LA, Aang doesn't even start with the basics. How can you miss the main theme like that?------------------------------------\nNetflix could have done it. The good foundations were there. But unfortunately the series was destroyed by time savings and character changes. I'd rather stick with the original. I have funny scenes, character development and a story that goes into depth.","rating":"4\/10","date":"26 February 2024"}

{"title":"3 Stars for Costuming, Set Design, and VFX","review":"I see that a lot of the positive comments are centered around how realistic this version of the show is, which is interesting because this is exactly what I found off about it. It wasn't the realism that made the original cartoon great: it was the surrealism. Yes, there are very serious conversations and topics that arise in the show, but they are balanced out by the rest of the childlike wonderment that the characters and the world bring to the table. It's a beautiful execution that this live-action simply isn't achieving.For starters, there is too much CGI and not enough on-location shots for the backdrops\/backgrounds (which is wild considering they spent $15 million per episode). Despite the great prop design and costuming, it's a bit of an eyesore to see how animated and artificial every other aspect of the scenes are. CGI shouldn't be doing ALL of the work. It should be used to *enhance* the scene not dominate it. There needs to be the right balance of practical effects and digital effect to truly make something fantastical. Instead, it is doing all of the heavy lifting in this show.There are also too many character arcs being rushed in this first season that aren't allowing us to enjoy watching the characters grow, but instead relies on the watchers (presumed) knowledge of them beforehand. And yes: they are ruining many of the characters by changing their fundamental nature. All of the characters stories are so closely tied together that when you ruin who one character is, you negatively impact them all...Sokka not being sexist is one of the biggest flaws in this live-action. We don't need to remove it from the script, we need to show it being removed through his interactions with other characters in the show. Katara was a driving force behind his change and now she is also lacking character development because, instead of being a force of feminism, she is only here for emotionally supporting the rest of the group (when she did both in the original cartoon).Aang is very kind, and friendly here but he is not trying to run away from his responsibility like he did in the cartoon. His struggle to overcome his desire to make peace without making hard decisions may be shown, but it is nowhere near as impactful as it was in the cartoon because in the cartoon he spends the entire first season in denial about it. Ozai, Azula, Bumi, and a host of other characters suffer from similar alterations made to their character's personalities\/behaviors (and none for the better).Zuko and Iroh are admittedly the only characters I think have maintained their essence, but I wish they weren't trying to rush their arcs. Zuko is far more emotionally intelligent in this first season. He isn't a hot-headed, short-tempered, teenager who is blindsided by his desire for his father's affection that he ignores the affection being given by his uncle. Instead he is very patient with Iroh, and shows great empathy towards him (especially knowing he lost his son in the war). And while this all happens, it is meant to happen over time. We can't appreciate it the way we can in the cartoon, because it's what we are being shown right from the beginning instead of growing with the character.So many of the viewers leaving positive reviews seem to have wanted this to be a more \"adult\" or \"realistic\" version I guess, but that's not Avatar. If this had been presented in the form of a retelling instead of an adaptation from cartoon to live-action, I would see the validity in making these sorts of changes (whether I agree with them or not). But that's NOT the case. Instead the folks behind this show seem to be struggling in their desire to ground the show in a tone of seriousness, while keeping it light-hearted and fun at the same time. Something the cartoon achieves flawlessly, but in the reverse.","rating":"3\/10","date":"5 March 2024"}
{"title":"When the story is weak...","review":"I love how the characters look, they act, the effects are awesome...But, when the story is tangled like that, it doesn't make it good at all. There are so much plot is missed, and there are no surprises.Look how Bumi is depicted for instance. They revealed his identity right away. And he's so revengeful against Aang, and hates him for not being there when the war began. In the original, Bumi is a very lovable, joyful character.Suki is cleaning up his face like it's nothing, and Sokka isn't wear his make-up. So, how will it be like at the prison episode in Book 3?For some reason, The Machinist lives in Omashu and Jet is planning to assassinate Bumi, so there will be no Northern Air Temple episode.And for some reason, we see Wan Shi Tong in the Spirit of the Forest episode. Why is that man?Overall, best I can give is 5\/10 and it's because of the effects and characters' look. Story is a big zero.As an old fan who watched the original show since 2005, I could've expected it to be written better, not butchered like this.","rating":"5\/10","date":"22 February 2024"}
{"title":"Adaptations should adapt, not just steal character names and a base concept","review":"Some of the greatest shows and movies of all time have been adaptations of successful past shows or books. Shawshank redemption, the dark knight, LotR, the walking dead, the Addams family. And what they all did was take a successful piece of source material, adapt it to some extent so it works better for a new format and portray the same world but in a new and interesting light.This show shows absolutely no respect for its source material. The story is driven at a completely different pace to the original, with characters acting completely different to how they were originally. In fact in many cases the only similarity between the original character and the new one is the name.A major complaint of mine is the hypocrisy in this show. They hired Michael and Bryan the original minds behind ATLA and then proceeded to give them no creative control. They also said they refused to allow Sokka to have his arc of sexism then being put in his place and learning but decided to keep Pakku's sexism arc but without him changing his views. This is honestly a step backwards from the original and a horrible decision for both sokka and pakku's characters.Many people are praising the casting however with the exceptions of Ozai and Zuko, the acting is horrific and the actors have no similarities to the characters they portray. Both Aang and Katara's actors are quite lifeless (though I appreciate Gordans age and that he may not be experienced yet) and seem to have been cast as people who are completely unlike the characters they've been asked to portray.The visual effects are to some extent a redeeming quality of the show. The bending is beautiful and the respect for martial arts is admirable. However, the cgi in many areas is terrible. The animals are akin to \"ugly sonic\" and at times regular human beings seem to be allowed to jump 6\/7 metres in the air from a standing start.A major issue with the bending however comes in the form of balance. As far as source material comes \"sozin's comet\" empowers fire benders with the power of a hundred suns. However in this show, the scenes of them utilising this power show them to be no more powerful than Zuko, Iroh or Ozai are in a regular situation, including at night. Another major complaint is \"training\" seems entirely unnecessary. Katara can go from barely being able to ripple water, to moving a column of water 100 feet in the air within 24 hours because aang told her to believe in herself however in the next few episodes she shows no signs of being able to display any similar levels of strength. On the other end of the spectrum aang is shows to be able to fly completely apart from his glider, essentially a giant middle finger from Netflix towards the original show, the comics and the legend of Korra.Last but certainly not least, the makeup department. I haven't seen any show or movie in the past 10 years let alone a show with one of the highest budgets per episode Netflix have ever spent be so poor in this department. There are many extremely visible bald caps, hair dye sprays, and wrinkles that seem to be drawn onto their faces but not to their bodies. Bumi in particular: it is very obvious that he is a 40 year old actor portraying a 112 year old man because the makeup team let them down so badly.I would not at all recommend this show unless you very much appreciate visual effects and if you do, make the most of any scenes containing Zuko or Ozai because it's all downhill from there.","rating":"2\/10","date":"26 February 2024"}
{"title":"Frankly Disgusting; Watch the animated series","review":"Having watched both this and the animated series on release, I find these positive reviews baffling. The original, while in some respects more juvenile, showed complex characterization that organically evolved over the course of three seasons, weaving together a unique and compelling narrative. This is.... not that. I rated 2 stars because of the compelling visuals (one advantage it has above Shyamalan's abysmal production), but in every other respect this series is utterly devoid of merit.I'm not the kind of watcher who expects adaptations and sequels to remain 100% in line with the source material. Hell, I even enjoyed the rings of power and have argued in its defense. This is indefensible. At the very least one expects an adaptation to form a coherent supported narrative even if that doesn't align with the direction of the original. This show is like the writers heard someone describing the original series without watching it, and tried to replicate it, one episode at a time, without understanding how the plot was supposed to come together or why the characters had chemistry. It has a very 'designed by committee' feeling to the plotlines, sometimes seen in other netflix originals but seldom to this degree.The series' one redeeming factor is that watching inspired me to undertake a re-watch of the original for the first time since I was in college almost a decade ago. Remembering it as somewhat goofy and immature I was somewhat surprised to find that it not only holds up excellently but that there were elements to the show I hadn't appreciated in previous watches even as a young adult.I suppose one shouldn't be surprised that Netflix could put out something so soulless, yet the fact that the cheapening of this property was so unnecessary and egregious stings deeply nonetheless. Like with Shyamalan's production, we are once again in the position of being better off pretending the adaptation doesn't exist.","rating":"2\/10","date":"19 May 2024"}

Also it was way more serious than the original show. Character building was not as good as good, felt a bit forced. They are really pressing the love stories as well.

They completely missed the lesson to show, dont tell and lost a lot of the character progression. I think as a sort of reboot it's okay. The vfx are great and enjoyable. It's nice to see the characters come to life and I didn't mind the changes they made. Allthough some are very questionable. But as a series. It's just bad. Zero empathy for any of the characters. A lot of key moments missed. Like Bumi immediatly being recognised and it's not even a nice reunion of friendship. Bumi just goes on to learn aang a lesson, by telling the lesson exactly. A lot of series and films are incredibly badly written lately. Hope we get some authenticity back by single writers or directors. Instead of this disneyfication and mishmesh of ideas. By being this afraid of failure, and creating a median between different opinions. You create a median of mediocraty. It's okay for what it is.

{"title":"Messy show that doesn't even trust your intelligence","review":"Netflix's Avatar: The Last Air Bender is yet another adaptation that seems embarrassed of its animation roots. You can tell that the creatives behind this felt that they could do it better and made completely unnecessary (or outright outlandish) changes to the story that only ended up making the show worse. They also don't have a single piece of trust for the audience, as there's a ridiculous amount of exposition. Characters will reexplain themselves (or what's going on) over and over again.

{"title":"Unmet expectations","review":"The casting decisions in Netflix's latest Avatar series leave much to be desired, as the chosen actors fail to embody the expected physical attributes as well as emotional depth of their respective characters. There's a noticeable lack of conviction in their portrayals, making it difficult for viewers to fully invest in or relate to the characters' journeys.Comedic and tragic elements within the storytelling feels uneven and never fully blown, robbing the narrative of its potential emotional impact. This lack of depth and nuance in character development further exacerbates the issue, leaving the audience feeling disconnected from the unfolding events.The pacing of the series suffers, with the narrative feeling rushed and disjointed at times. Stories treated in a haste, and there's a sense of urgency that detracts from the overall coherence of the story. As a result, key plot points may feel underdeveloped or glossed over, leaving viewers wanting more clarity and depth.The series attempts to mash up multiple storylines simultaneously, resulting in a tangled web of narratives that often feel inconsequential and insignificant. This mishmash of plots diminishes the impact of individual story arcs.In essence, Netflix's Avatar series struggles to do justice to its source material, failing to capture the essence of the beloved original series. With its lackluster casting, uneven storytelling, rushed pacing, and muddled plotlines, the series falls short of delivering a truly immersive and satisfying viewing experience.","rating":"1\/10","date":"5 March 2024"}
{"title":"Please stop trying to make this a live-action","review":"I struggled to get to the end. The original show is probably one of my favorites oat. But this just doesn't capture the essence of the animated show. There's no depth to the character (only the things that I already know from watching the original 100 times), the dialogue is kinda cringe a lot of times. To be honest, it's not the only thing that makes this better than the movie is that this is visually gorgeous. That's the only good think about this show. If you want to be entertained and look to beautiful images, this is for you. If you're coming from the story... just go watch the animated show.Please stop trying to reboot this show.","rating":"5\/10","date":"16 May 2024"}
{"title":"Just Watch the OG Animated Series","review":"I went into this with hopefulness, but realized very early on that this series is a totally feckless venture. Not surprising given Netflix and the clikate of TV and film over the last decade. The lack of necessary liquid cash to flesh out the fantasical world with its hybrid creatures, particularly two that are arguably supporting characters, to the failure to deliver on VFX which seem more suited for a triple A video game than a live action show to the astonishingly costumy costumes couldn't be more apparent. And to great detriment. I mean the attempt to show the genocide of the Airbenders or at least one moment of that tragedy was pathetically laughable and the first red flag of many.The acting is literally the kind of acting you'd see in the live action shows on Nickelodeon or Disney: stilted, over the top and just bad like I'm in high school drama bad. Even Daniel Dae Kim can only do so much with the equally high school drama level scripts the cast was given.The awkward and overstuffed nearly hour-long 8-episode order is a garbled mess of the 30-min 20 episode first season for the original series. That trend will undoubtedly continue in the next season for the next book, which given the numbers for this adaptation, will probably be confirmed.The one merit I can acknowledge is maybe casting. It's great they went the route of let's get folks who fit the blend of cultures being referenced for this world and its people. And not just that, a small handful of the main characters fit their cartoon predecessors well. That said, chemistry between certain pairs and trios didn't feel 100% there because again, the acting and the writing.At times you could see what could've been and then you see why the original animated series showrunners exited.","rating":"3\/10","date":"6 March 2024"}
{"title":"Visuals are great but poor acting makes this a hard watch.","review":"Loved this show as a cartoon. One of my favorites. Visuals are really good on this live action series but the acting is tough to watch. I tried to keep going but the acting got worst and worst as it went on. I made it to episode 5 and couldn't keep going.I'm not sure who decided on the cast but they didn't do a good job. Some characters were OK but the main characters are not. Better casting and this show could of been amazing.I would suggest you stick with the cartoon and pass on this one altogether. If you are looking for a great show, Shogun on Hulu and Disney + is probably the best show for 2024. Over 9 imdb and worth every star.","rating":"3\/10","date":"4 March 2024"}
{"title":"Just what are we doing people......","review":"This has to be one of the biggest disappointments of the year, and I'll leave it up to others to decide if more nouns need to be used eg: decade etc. One of the most iconic, well paced, well developed stories of our time had to make weight for the next competition and wore lots of plastic. What has been cut from the og story, which led to such an integrated and pleasant experience, is not only noticeable and missed, it's a downright crime.This is not about necessarily changes. Some were ok and could fit in, others not so much but that happens with creative license. This is about a cut, with no change, no fill, just straight cut.Aangs story of coming of age with the literal world on his shoulders while he tries to find a way to right the world while staying true to his air nomad upbringing. His silliness and comedy and innocence endeared us to him and we felt his pain and joy, his struggles and his accomplishments.Katara's story of trying to overcome the tyranny of being conquered and oppressed and the bias of her own people all the while trying to fill in for her mother.Sokka's story of coming to the realization that gender roles aren't what he thought they were and the whole shift in who he is and how he see's things.None of this exists in any substantial amount because it's literally been chopped and the story rushed. Important characters like Appa are no more than an end table lamp. Azula is too on the nose with her shtick that it seems fake. Where is the epic scene where sozun lets roku die?Costumes were half good half bad. Azula's faceplate at the victory of Omashu looked like the prop it was.Cgi was great, til it wasn't and you could almost see lines.Lastly I will mention one change that I disagree with, and that is changing how the Avatar fundamentally works and communicates. If the Avatar can be possessed by previous avatars, what is the need of learning other bending disciplines? It just makes no sense when part of the struggle is about becoming stronger and training more and learning more. Just call on kyoshi, or roku and take a nap. And the whole having to go to their shrines to talk to them will bight them in the butt in further books.There are some pros, but honestly I'm done giving credit for half done material especially when there was no reason for it to be this way. This season needed prob 6 more episodes and you could have lived with the abbreviated retell.","rating":"4\/10","date":"26 February 2024"}

The cinematics of this series is mindblowing and it is clear that money was given wings to create the universe for Aang to rule. So, lots of money and an army of CGI artists ready to bring this series to life. And what do they do? Trawl the streets and hire the first Asian Travelling Theatre Company they can find. I cannot identify a single loveable and credible character in this show. How is it possible that this level of production has a +7 rating on IMDB? Acting is horrible.

Now I understand better why the original producers left. Even though I had low expectations, it was a complete disappointment. I think Netflix should withdraw this series before it causes any further damage. I'm not curious about season 2 at all. It is better not to withdraw. The scenes and locations are nice, but the effects don't feel very natural with the bending movements. There shouldn't be any slow motion shots in particular. It spoils the naturalness and immersion. The only good comment I can make about this series would be the CGI part.I gave 1 point specifically to lower the average. I don't think he deserved this score. My actual score is 4\/10.","rating":"1\/10","date":"24 February 2024"}
{"title":"As disappointing as phantom menace","review":"It starts well, but then quickly devolves into a poorly written, directed, casted tragedy for anyone who loved the Nicolodeon animated series. By the time it ends, it feels like the M. Knight Shyamalan abomination. The writers included a lot of Easter eggs from TAS, but it's not enough to make up for the ridiculous attempt to inject little, middle school fan fiction emotional dialogue scenes.For those who might say that there just isn't enough time to include everything into an adaptation, they're wrong. The writers decided to take the whole story and twist it into a pandering travesty. The reason ATLA was amazing was cause it addressed real issues embedded in a well-written story. This does the opposite, trying to address real topics with lazy writing.The show doesn't hold up on its own, as a separate production from the animated series, much less as a live action remake. I finished the series and was just disgusted that so much time and energy was dumped into such a garbage result.","rating":"1\/10","date":"25 February 2024"}
{"title":"Trash","review":"Why do they keep trying to live action this IP? The bending looked decent, but the cgi was otherwise very inconsistent. Oppa and momo look really uncanny and soem of the scenes look like the actors are just standing in front of a blue screen. The costumes are mostly ok, but some are seriously garbage. Episodes 2-5 are a jumbled mess, they split up the cast before it really felt like they had a good bond. It got weird when Katara and Sokka went in the cave of two lovers together. But the worst thing was king Bumi. He easily had the most fake looking costume in the show. His dialog was poorly delivered aswell.","rating":"1\/10","date":"24 February 2024"}
{"title":"Trash","review":"Honestly just not my favorite. They have good parts but too many changes and feels way too rushed. 4\/10. The characters such as katara seemed way too weak. She was bland, boring and had absolutely no emotion to her when acting. I actually hated every time she came on screen and she felt nothing like katara. Sokka is trash and so is ang. All the acting in this show feels super sub par like they just casted anyone for these roles. I'm very disappointed in the overall quality of the show. It feels like a fan made film and once again, a live action remake of an anime goes bad. I see why the OG creators left.","rating":"1\/10","date":"25 February 2024"}
{"title":"Shame.. Just shame!","review":"Unfortunately, this series repeats past mistakes, failing to capture the essence and magic that defined the beloved animated original. Despite advancements in animation and visual effects that might have offered a more immersive experience, the series is plagued by the same core issues that marred the movie: lackluster storytelling, inadequate character development, and a deviation from the rich lore and heartfelt narratives that fans cherished.The live-action adaptation struggles to resonate on any meaningful level. It reduces a complex, beautifully crafted universe to a shadow of its potential, with characters who feel disconnected from their animated counterparts. These characters fail to convey the depth, struggle, and growth that made the original series compelling. Scenes meant to be powerful are instead rendered laughable, with pivotal storylines altered or omitted, undermining the gravitas and coherence of the world that fans have come to know and love.Especially the introduction of Avatar Roku was too shameful and an unforgivable mistake. I was unable to even watch this mess.","rating":"1\/10","date":"24 February 2024"}
{"title":"Big dissapointment.","review":"For me, the new LA series from Avatar is a kind of popcorn series without any pretensions. The attempt was made to appeal to a young audience that was as undemanding as possible and that placed little value on a) well-written characters with quirks, b) good dialogue and c) a comprehensible story without major holes in logic. There is even more action, mediocre CGI and drama on offer.For me, it was sometimes unbearable what they created and I can only shake my head when I read that fans of the original series can only partially approve of this.Grade: I'm giving this 2\/10 stars because I liked some of the costumes and sometimes there was iconic music. (but mostly there was just pale noise that had nothing to do with the good original music)Overall, I was very disappointed and can't recommend the series to anyone who values good characters, dialogue and a good story.","rating":"1\/10","date":"24 February 2024"}

Moreover, the lines they are given are infantile - and delivered in an American accent by all, no matter where the characters are supposed to hail from. Made the series impossible to continue watching.But maybe I am expecting too much, given that ATLA was originally a cartoon. I have no comment on the graphics or on the story as it unfolds.The visual effects are indeed good but that is not enough to draw me and make me continue watching. Nor is the dramatic music to try to give gravitas to the simplistic dialogue.So, I do not recommend this series.","rating":"1\/10","date":"27 February 2024"}

The pacing and writing is just abhorent and they cut all of the filler stuff which developed the original characters into who they were and moved the story along. I have not laughed once during the shows and there is just no theme to it. Even if the original ATLA show was not made and this was a standalone, it would still be a bland show with horrible writing and bad pacing.

It also felt like introductory was 6 episodes long and it just got interesting the last two episodes. I have never understood all the hate on the movie. If you look at the movie alone it's a good movie especially compared to this series. Like everyone else is saying the visuals are amazing but 90% of the actors are just... extremely hard to watch. The show still kept me wanting to see what would happen so I guess that's good. It's one of those shows where you could watch it but you could definitely live without it. Also the humor? One of those things you look at someone you're watching it with and like \"really?\"","rating":"5\/10","date":"24 February 2024"}
{"title":"Tale of Unwanted Parody: Depth's Quest in Netflix's Shallows","review":"Netflix's recent foray into the Avatar universe can best be described as an unintended parody, a far cry from the profound narrative and emotional depth that defined the original animated series. Where the original series was celebrated for its rich character development, compelling storytelling, and thoughtful exploration of themes, this new adaptation feels like a caricature, stripped of the original's sincerity and depth.In this reimagined version, the attempt to introduce darker themes in pursuit of a mature tone comes off as contrived and superficial. It's as if the show is trying too hard to be something it's not, losing sight of the original's nuanced exploration of complex issues. The result is a series that feels more like a mockery of its source material than a tribute or a serious adaptation.Character development, one of the cornerstones of the original series, is woefully neglected in Netflix's rendition. The characters feel hollow, their motivations unclear and their relationships with one another lack the depth and growth that made the original so engaging. Instead of witnessing meaningful interactions and development, viewers are treated to shallow dialogues and a disjointed narrative that fails to capture the essence of the beloved characters or their journey.Moreover, the series' reliance on exposition over storytelling further dilutes its impact, leaving little room for the emotional resonance that was a hallmark of the original series. The narrative feels rushed and incoherent, with key plot points and character developments glossed over or handled with such a lack of finesse that they seem almost parodic.The visual effects and action sequences, while technically impressive, cannot compensate for the narrative and emotional shortcomings. They stand as a hollow shell when the soul of the story is missing. It's a visual spectacle that lacks the heart and substance of its predecessor.To those unfamiliar with the original Avatar series, Netflix's adaptation might seem like an adequate fantasy adventure. However, for fans of the original, it's impossible not to see this version as anything but a pale imitation, an unintentional parody that misses the mark by a wide margin. It serves as a stark reminder that not all adaptations are created equal, and sometimes, an attempt to reinvent a classic can end up diminishing its legacy rather than enhancing it.Viewed through the lens of parody, perhaps one can find a different kind of enjoyment in Netflix's Avatar, appreciating it for what it is rather than what it fails to be. Yet, even with this perspective, it's hard not to mourn the missed opportunity to truly honor and expand upon the rich world of the original series. In its bid to innovate and reinterpret, Netflix's Avatar ultimately serves as a cautionary tale of how straying too far from the source material can lead to a product that feels disconnected and insincere, a shadow of the masterpiece it sought to emulate.","rating":"1\/10","date":"26 February 2024"}

I get they need to change things for a the live action and adapt for 8 episodes but most of the things that changed were pointless and needlessly altered. Esthetically speaking it does look amazing but that's all it's got going for it, take out the special effects and your left woth cosplay type costumes and bad acting and a butchered story.

Nice to see such Asian heavy casting true to the contentThe Bad:\nEverything...I know they're just kids but the acting from both kids and adults is so bad it makes you uncomfortable. Writing is terrible. Each scene feels rushed. They clearly condensed a ton of content so the pace is too fast. The vibe is cheesy Disney channel feel. I know this is taken from a kids show. But the kids who liked the original Avatar are all adults now. Why make a live action for 6 year olds? Would have been great if they went for a little more mature darker feel. I'm convinced if any viewers had zero familiarity with the original they would have no idea what's happening. It's very hard to get through. Although it is better than M. Nights (which is literally one of the worst movies ever ((like most of his))) movie it's like they didn't even care to make it better.

{"title":"Not believable","review":"As a dedicated fan of the original \"Avatar: The Last Airbender\" series, the release of the new series was met with eager anticipation. However, after watching the first few episodes, it became clear that this revival fell far short of expectations.One of the most glaring issues with the new series is the lack of believability. From the onset, it was difficult to suspend disbelief and immerse oneself in the storyline. The plot felt forced, the character development shallow, and the overall execution lacking in coherence.Furthermore, the absence of humor, a hallmark of the original series, was sorely felt. The witty banter and comedic moments that endeared fans to the characters were conspicuously absent, leaving the viewer longing for the lightheartedness that made the original series so enjoyable.Perhaps the biggest misstep was the portrayal of the protagonist, Aang. Despite being a 12-year-old boy, Aang's character was inexplicably depicted as a mature 30-year-old man. His actions and demeanor were wholly incongruent with his age, making it difficult for viewers to connect with him on an emotional level.Overall, the new series failed to capture the magic of its predecessor. Its lackluster plot, absence of humor, and unrealistic characterizations left much to be desired. As a longtime fan of the franchise, it is disappointing to see such a beloved series fall short of its potential.In conclusion, I would not recommend the new series of \"Avatar: The Last Airbender\" to fellow fans. It fails to live up to the legacy of the original and ultimately falls flat in its execution.","rating":"1\/10","date":"27 February 2024"}
{"title":"Underwhelming and poorly written","review":"I did not expect a copy of the animated and I did not get that. What we got instead is a very dry tv series which happens to feature the characters from the original. There is no character development and growth, which you would expect with characters of that age. The visual effects were nice but the fights were lackluster. Acting is dry, and so is the story. The show has absolutely no mystery, no \"edge of the seat moments\". I really wanted to like it but I couldn't even after 4 episodes. Also, they failed to make the show interesting for someone who has watched the animated series, as what they did was basically retelling (exactly, retel not reshow) the stories from the original in a condensed or modified manner which was plain annoying, and the new stuff they added was lacking personality and life. Would definitely not recommend anyone watches is at is does not captivate, and 100% don't watch if you've watched the original.","rating":"1\/10","date":"29 February 2024"}
{"title":"Better than the movie but still massively flawed.","review":"The Netflix series is definitely better than the absolute failure of a movie. But that does not mean it's good.Some of its strong points are the visual effects and the set designs. Some of the acting is decent especially for what they have been given to work with, in particular Iroh and I quite liked Bumi. The good points sadly end there for me.The condensing of the season has had a massively negative impact on the show... For returning viewers like myself it makes it confused and things feel out of place as well as moments happening in odd orders. Even from a fresh perspective the moments are not given much time to breath and have an impact. For example, the intro to the first episode has an explanation and expansion (from my knowledge anyway) of what happened to the Air nomads. In principal I don't disagree with this addition, but what I do have a problem with is it being show to us and only us. Meaning that the characters themselves do not experience the events. With us being shown what happens when it is later shown to us again through the eyes of the gang, it has no impact as we have already been shown what happened.Another example of weird placement thanks to the condensation of the show is having the mechanist and his son show up in Omashu. This removes Aang finding out that the other temples as well as his were hot in the initial attack. It also puts that story as well as the story of Omashu together giving nether of them the time that they deserve. It also removes the begining of Aang and Kataras relationship from the cave of two lovers, though this might be a good choice as it was a little rough in the original.One of the worst things to have been done to the show is the removal of all the fun elements and goofiness. The removal of this just guts the soul of the show and makes it seem all to harsh and unfriendly. The trip to Kyoshi island seems almost pointless and getting guidance from her at such an early point is not right for Aang when he should have been getting guidance from Roku. The trip was and should have been to ride the elephants koi.Although we only have season 1 so far, I am also concerned with the characterisation of Iroh. While it might just be a bad feeling if it does get more seasons I hope things play out as they should.","rating":"2\/10","date":"22 February 2024"}
{"title":"Complete Bastardization","review":"I honestly had an open about this show before I heard the Director spouting about the changes he was implementing a few weeks ago online. The shear audacity of removing every single worth while Arc of every main character alone is enough to make my literal blood boil. If that weren't bad enough lets also take ever bit of initial charm from every single character the people who grew up with this series have grown to love. I'm not saying I would have only enjoyed a complete carbon copy of the original show, but all of the \"creative liberties\" that were taking literally just adult washed a series that was not broken and did not need to be fixed to appeal to a more mature audience. Making a show more mature yet cutting every ounce of character growth? Making a show mature but cutting every arch that was too mature for a kids show? I am honestly so confused as to what message this new monstrosity is suppose to leave me with, other than the obvious fact that a show like the animated Avatar The Last Airbender does not need to be remade, because clearly the only people who have the rights to do it do not have the intelligence to represent the masterpiece that it was.","rating":"1\/10","date":"23 February 2024"}

{"title":"Disappointing and Overrated: Avatar: The Last Airbender Falls Flat","review":"As a long-time fan of animated series and a connoisseur of storytelling, I approached \"Avatar: The Last Airbender\" with high expectations. However, after giving it a fair chance and watching the series in its entirety, I can confidently say that it failed to live up to the hype and left me thoroughly unimpressed.First and foremost, the biggest issue with \"Avatar: The Last Airbender\" lies in its lackluster and predictable storytelling. While the concept of a world divided into four elemental nations with individuals who can manipulate the elements is intriguing, the execution falls short. The plot follows a formulaic pattern, with little deviation from the typical hero's journey archetype. The storylines are often clich\u221a\u00a9, and the plot twists are telegraphed from miles away, robbing the series of any genuine sense of excitement or suspense.Moreover, the characters in \"Avatar: The Last Airbender\" are disappointingly one-dimensional and lack depth. The protagonist, Aang, is a prime example of this. Despite being the so-called \"chosen one\" destined to save the world, Aang comes across as bland and unrelatable. His struggles and conflicts feel contrived, and his character development is minimal at best. The supporting cast fares no better, with characters like Katara and Sokka failing to leave a lasting impression due to their lack of compelling arcs or personalities.Furthermore, the dialogue in \"Avatar: The Last Airbender\" often feels forced and unnatural. Instead of engaging in meaningful conversations that deepen our understanding of the characters and their motivations, the characters frequently resort to exposition-heavy monologues and cheesy one-liners. This detracts from the overall immersion of the series and makes it difficult to become emotionally invested in the characters' journeys.Another major flaw of \"Avatar: The Last Airbender\" is its animation style, which feels outdated and amateurish compared to other contemporary animated series. While the creators may have aimed for a unique aesthetic, the end result comes across as visually unappealing and fails to capture the imagination in the way that other animated series have done successfully. The action sequences, in particular, lack the fluidity and dynamism that one would expect from a series centered around martial arts and elemental bending.Additionally, the world-building in \"Avatar: The Last Airbender\" leaves much to be desired. While the concept of a world divided into four nations based on the elements is intriguing, the series fails to fully explore the cultural nuances and complexities of each nation. Instead, the world feels superficial and underdeveloped, with little attention to detail given to the customs, traditions, and histories of the various societies depicted.In conclusion, \"Avatar: The Last Airbender\" is a prime example of style over substance, a series that prioritizes flashy visuals and gimmicky concepts over compelling storytelling and well-rounded characters. Despite its widespread acclaim and dedicated fanbase, I found it to be a tedious and ultimately forgettable viewing experience. If you're looking for an animated series with depth, nuance, and genuine emotional resonance, I would recommend looking elsewhere.","rating":"1\/10","date":"1 March 2024"}

{"title":"Who was this made for? Not for fans at least.","review":"An incredibly mediocre remake of a fantastic cartoon. The story has been butchered and stripped of its complexity. The acting is stiff and amateurish. Even the choreography is sloppy and the fights are just jumpcut after jumpcut.Why would anybody choose to watch this when the original cartoon does a much better job of telling a the same story.This remake chops up the order of the story and makes it so a lot of story beats just don't have any emotional impact.The visuals are okay and the costume design is adequate at best. The CGI for the bending is a step up from the movie but that's not saying much, it's a stiff CGI mess.Also, give Zulo a real scar you cowards!","rating":"2\/10","date":"23 February 2024"}
{"title":"Bad Script, Bad Directing, Terrible Acting","review":"I was most disappointed in the writing and acting from the character, Aang. A character filled with such emotion, immense joy, horrific sadness, grief, pain, going through so much, especially in the beginning of the season. None of that came through. Absolutely terrible, it made the show unwatchable, I cringed everytime Aang came on the screen.Also why isn't saske funny! His entire personality changed vs the show. You took one of the most beloved, joyful, funny, witty, characters and made him as dull as a door post. Not ok.But it's not all the actors faults, whoever cast them for the roll, is to blame too. Terrible job all around. The only good cast for their roll was Uncle Iroh, good job by him. Everyone else was garbage.And On a plus side the cinematography and special effects were well done.","rating":"1\/10","date":"23 February 2024"}
{"title":"I got my hopes up","review":"I'm tired of reading \"well if you're an OG fan, you're being close minded...\". If you say you're going to do a live action of Avatar: The Last Airbender, then it should exactly be like the original Avatar: The Last Airbender. If not, call it something else, because what is the point??? They basically took the characters from the original and made a whole new storyline. The acting and writing of this show is terrible. They removed all the emotion, humor, and character development that came with the original storyline. I didn't even finish the first episode because it couldn't keep my attention, it was that flat and uninteresting. Not even the overuse of CGI could catch my attention. Do it right or don't do at all, make something new and stop attempting to try to piggyback off of great shows because it's not working.","rating":"1\/10","date":"24 February 2024"}
{"title":"Terrible","review":"Firstly, the actors all seem soulless and aside from ty Lee and sokka seem badly cast, zuko is far more of a crybaby and his face is looks nothing how zuko should look, same for Mai and azula. Katara and iron look ok but their lines and delivery are terrible and overall the acting is just abysmal. Sokka and the fire lord are decent, the rest not so much. The visuals (the easiest part it's all cgi) are decent. The story is rushed and butchered, aang is nothing like the original, and azula is already falling apart and making mistakes before the first season is even over, whereas she makes next to none in the original, until near the end also her fire isn't blue. For some bizarre reason they have zuko fighting his father instead of just taking the burn and partly getting the best of him, which is a polar opposite in both ways to his original character. It seems they are trying to do their own thing but they've failed utterly, keep the set and effects recast most of them and stick to the original script, the original avatar is a masterpiece compared to this, this is like a bad YouTube movies version.","rating":"1\/10","date":"9 March 2024"}
{"title":"Disappointed but not surprised","review":"Sokka's personality was extremely gutted. He goes from a very funny character (probably the funniest in the whole show) in the cartoon to almost no personality at all in this show. The CGI and bending looked very weak for the most part. Only a handful of scenes had decent looking bending. A much higher budget would be needed in a show like this to improve on all of the CGI that would be needed. I feel as if this show cannot be created until a few more years down the road when CGI is a lot more affordable, when AI is a lot more advanced, or like I said, the budget is increased. Character development is almost nonexistent. I have no connection at all with any of the characters. Acting is a little less than mediocre but they're children so understandable. I'm shocked it has such a high rating on IMDB, no one in my circle thought that it was a 5\/10. Average was 4\/10.","rating":"1\/10","date":"29 February 2024"}
{"title":"A Strained and Painful Watch","review":"As someone who has seen the live-action film, and the original animated series quite recently. I can say without a doubt this is perhaps the worst show I have ever watched, which felt like a struggle to get through the episodes. Here's why:The graphics and visual effects team are perhaps the only redeeming quality of this series. The visuals are well thought out with how the different elements and physics work, which made fight scenes more enjoyable to watch. This is a step up over the poor visuals we saw from the live-action film, so credit where credit is due.The BIG disappointment in this series comes down to the story-telling, acting, and somewhat the casting.With regards to the story, everything feels rushed. They combine multiple stories into the same timeline in an episode which is confusing as they miss out important character development moments, and makes it hard to keep track of what is going on. Think of it as starting at story A, then suddenly we jump to story Z without understanding how we got there. This hindered us from making a true connection to the characters; wanting them to succeed. Coincidentally, this series ends at the same point as the live-action film, so nothing new has really been added.The majority of the acting feels stale and surface-level. With a few exceptions of the fire king and Iroh, there was no real humor or depth to how the characters were potrayed. There were a few cringe-worthy deliveries that fell flat. I feel this could be a result of the script itself, but it does make me wonder if the cast had more recognisable people in, would they deliver it any better?Some believe it to be unfair to compare this to the original series, but it is a direct-remake and is clearly targets those fans too. No fan service was done in this series.Overall; this was painful and arduous to sit through. If I could go back, I would forget about this and rewatch the original again.","rating":"2\/10","date":"27 February 2024"}
{"title":"Just Netflix being Netflix","review":"I watched it because of the hype and how some reviewers rated it quite high.But I guess this is just Netflix being Netflix.Positives:\nThe visual effects looks quite good. The bending technique is quite good, Appa and Momo's visual is superb! And Daniel Dae Kim's casting is spot on.Negatives:\n1. The biggest downside is the story, it deviates so much from the original series that the characters feels different and unrecognizable. It feels rushed hence the development is severely lacking. The decision to mash a few events into 1 is completely wrong. This changes the meaning the events did for the characters.It would have been better to split the first book into 2 seasons if they are constrained to only 8 episodes.2. The fight scenes are off.Even though the CGI looks quite good but the overall scene looks bad.First the bending movement is really bad, the original series based each bending on certain martial art disciplines hence it looks great and feels real. Here though, it feels strange and disconnected.3. Missed opportunities.Because the mash different events into one, a lot of cool scenes is missed.Avatar Roku's scene is gone, and the events in the swamp is altered so much.4. Casting\nWell, some of it is great (especially Daniel Dae Kim as Fire Lord Ozai), but Azula and Mai? I mean come on!Roku and Iroh also don't feel right (hell Roku looks so different than his statue).So overall, another missed opportunity from netflix.The original creator's departure is a telltale sign that this is going to be another disaster. I put my hopes to high.","rating":"4\/10","date":"9 March 2024"}
{"title":"As a fan of the original: this hurts and lacks of a soul","review":"I had hope, low expectations and was open-minded enough to accept changes... but this?!I've binge-watched the whole thing now... It started off well having major similarities with the original show which I enjoyed. Most of the casting is very on point (esp. Sokka's and Suki's actors). A few new extra parts that were shown to us were very enjoyable as well. But... the plot\/writing... I feel like the \"Gaang\" when they watched the play about themselves. A partly terrible and just WRONG plot but \"the effects were decent\". This whole live action was lacking soul and character (apart from a few moments). I don't even know where to start. Basically everything changed when the Omashu episode attacked... (SPOILERS AHEAD)Besides some very weird dialogs that felt super unnatural, they mixed up and changed parts of the plot in such a weird way and I didn't see any reason for doing that. I understand that they had to leave out\/merge a few things but some changes really didn't make sense and contributed to plot holes and a wrong portrayal of characters. What really bothers me a lot is that \"Team Avatar\" is barely a team. They all experience things separately and there is barely any of the character arc we originally knew and loved...There is absolutely no connection between Katara and Aang; Azula is an insecure mastermind who secretly works together with Zhao (?!); Bumi is a bitter old man who is dumping all his trauma on Aang; Katara doesn't have a function in the so-called \"Team Avatar\"; Wan Shi Ting randomly shows up in the spirit world for no reason and they cut off the story around Hei Bai; they messed up almost everything regarding the spirit world; they took out most of the funny and humorous stuff (I understand that they wanted to make it more serious but instead of putting random forced jokes in it, they could've just gone for more original jokes); they OVERexplain so much that could just be shown (especially in the end);I could go on and on about all the things that went completely wrong in this show but I think that's it for now. Being a huge fan of the OG show, many parts of the live action really hurt to watch. I fully understand now why the OG creators left.","rating":"3\/10","date":"23 February 2024"}
{"title":"I tried... I really tried to like it","review":"It is never easy to take on a subject that has such a strong, fanatic fan-base such as the last airbender (looking at you Lucas and the prequels). You'll never please the hardcore fans completely and that is accompanied with all sorts of backlash. I can appreciate that, in the light of keeping viewers on their toes, the creative team gave a different spin to characters and plot devices. What I can't forgive is how flat many of the performances were. Uncle Iroh and Zuko's relationship is at the core of the original.... this failed in that area... big time. Paul Sun-Hyung Lee was terrible in the Mandolorian and even worse here. He didn't give Iroh the comedy, wisdom and gravitas (at times) required.I watched the series slowly, often rewatching episodes to get a sober second look. I struggled to enjoy and connect with much in the series. I think the best thing for me, was the expansion of Ozai from a unidimensional character.","rating":"4\/10","date":"15 March 2024"}
{"title":"Just..why?","review":"I kept asking \"why?\" every time they changed something that was literally pointless to change. The characters are really flat and emotionless..except maybe Azula. Yes, the CGI is beautiful, but that's about it. The story is smashed together nonsensically and the relationships between the characters make no sense since there has been no relationship building shown. Katara is painful to watch to the point that it makes me sad. They removed her fiery personality, but forgot to give her another personality to replace it. Sokka's motivation for things don't make sense without the misogyny and gluttonous personality. I don't understand how true character growth can be shown later on in the series when we don't see the flaws first.The wigs...yikes. They spent so much money on CGI that they could only afford Party City wigs apparently.The show overall lacks the sort of love and passion that this series deserved. It feels like they had a checklist of things to include to cater to the fans and make the trailers look cool, but there was no heart put into it. It all just feels flat and lifeless.","rating":"4\/10","date":"4 March 2024"}

Horrible cast, horrible acting, horrible direction, highly dejected and disappointed...not worth watching at all and utter waste of time! The acting was exceptionally horrible, the story telling and sequence of the scripting and direction was ridiculous. The set seems too childish and unoriginal. The cast doesn't seem to know how to express the seriousness of a scene and it seems poorly directed.

{"title":"If M Night had an entire season in stead of just one movie","review":"For this to work, you needed a few 1-in-a-million child actors who were funny enough to run a room, and intelligent enough to broadcast expressions.Sadly, this was nothing but a dry, empty, emotionless, cosplay with incredible set design and epic fire bending.M Night's problem was that nothing was funny, all the conversations were breathy, desperate, and morose, and he full on changed the story in sucky ways.Netflix did the same and I could cry.Katara is empty, and doesn't come near embodying the feminine to balance Aang's propensity for meltdown. Katara is supposed to be Aang's hero, she tames what beast lives in him.Why, when Aang saw Gyatso's skeleton did she simply hide from him? Whose idea was this? At what point was Aang wrestling with the devil? And Zuko wrestling with the crippling hint of his better angels?Why did Iroh look like a cosplay of sultan from the 90's Aladdin movie?Honestly I'm so sad, because they made all the same mistakes as M Night and someone needed the spine to axe the project while they still had time.","rating":"1\/10","date":"24 February 2024"}

There is no live action adaptation and probably never will be. Netflix sure as heck could never pull that off. I really wish there was a live action adaptation though as it is my favorite childhood show and still watch it once a year for the nostalgia.

I understand for the sake of making a long series in to a limited series there has to be compromises. Yet this has completed deviated from the main plot line. The writers has cut and rewrite major plot points and characters development. The writers add so many unnecessary plot that served no enjoyable purpose. I think what upset me the most was changing Aang, King Bumi, Azula, Zhao, Uncle...basically all of the best characters. All of these characters personality and drives has turn 180! King Bumi is not supposed to be bitter and awful. Azula was not supposed to have daddy issue, she was supposed to have mommy issues. Aang has lost all his wise and fun loving nature. Katara is supposed to more fierce and determined. Why is does the Ocean spirit look like Godzilla instead of a fish spirit monster? Uncle Iroh feels like he just phony it in. Why the hell did Zhao get so much screen time?! It took away so much of Zuko plot. And let's not even start on the sham that is the spirit world and all the spirit characters. Omg so bad. Basically all the characters are all wrong. I don't blame any of the actors on the show tho. They're all just there doing what they love and getting a paycheck.

I really like the old one and I was hoping that this is a part 2 but no it's the same movie but longer and more details and like I said there's to much bad CGI. Nothing matches the old one I think that the producers didn't even watch the older movie. The only good CGI is at bending powers which are decent. I wish we could have more real things instead of CGI.

{"title":"Very few redeeming qualities here","review":"In the wake of the original animated series and the Korra sequel, I would've been shocked if someone wouldn't have tried to make a live action version at some point. And given the technology we have now for VFX, what better time?Of course, when you make a pure remake in the \"what if we had real people instead of animations\" where the actors are all that's real and everything else is CGI, you're setting yourself up for failure unless you also try to breathe something new into the story.This is what makes this series so sad: it has pretty good VFX\/SFX, the acting is more than decent given the ensemble. In many ways, it's better than I expected.So what gives then?First of all, as a fan of the original series, I can't get over the fact that it's a blatant attempt to cash in on nostalgia. Plain and simple. There's nothing new here.I can appreciate the actors and directors were in a no win situation here. A beloved series - but a different story or change in the \"canon\" world would raise protests. Be too faithful to the original material and people will be (like I am) quite \"meh\" about the final thing.Second, I would have prefferred a series focusing on the human aspect of the story. Too much VFX about bending is a trap in a live-action series. There's simply too much that worked well before because it was an 100% animated thing. The characters blended with the FX seamlessly. Here, despite the technology, despite the obvious care for details, a lot simply doesn't work and the actors end up looking laughable in scenes doing too much bending.In a children's animation like the original Avatar, a lot can be forgiven. Korra took a much more mature approach (as if catering for the fans growing up) and ended up a truly solid sequel.But this ... it looks great and kudos on the acting effort, but much of everything else (script\/writing\/ etc .... even music at times) falls way flat.","rating":"3\/10","date":"24 February 2024"}
{"title":"Neither the fun of the cartoon nor the poetry of Shyamalan","review":"I must be the one deep fan of Shyamalan's Last Airbender. Having not watched the cartoon before, I was amazed by the universe, but more importantly, by the poetry of that movie.Fast forward 14 years and Netflix has come out with a new live action show and the least one can say is it's profoundly disappointing. The first thing that stands out is the casting, which feels directly pulled from a Disney Channel show. And when you look at it even more closely, you realize everything in this version of The Last Airbender is like a Disney Channel show. From the bad dialogue to the poor acting and the impersonal directing, everything points to a show made to spend just enough to please the masses without taking any risk.But without risk, there is no payoff. The Last Airbender cartoon was fun and goofy. Shyamalan's film was poetic and choreographed like a ballet. This show, at least three episodes in, is just plain bad and a bit cheap.","rating":"1\/10","date":"24 February 2024"}

The CGI is even pretty decent, granted you have an actual flying bison as a main character. But the characters, their acting is so shallow and insufferable, that it's hard to watch. Some things are not meant to be converted into live action, and it becomes more obvious to me that this is nothing but another joyless cash grab. The characters lack any sliver of emotion, and it's like they are acting on tiktok. Very disappointed with how bad the acting and character depth is, and I wish people would leave good shows alone.","rating":"3\/10","date":"23 February 2024"}

The missing depth of characters and events was particularly triggering to watch. They glance over important events and character traits while this is what the entire series should be build on.

However, removing all of the side quests and eliminating the character building moments really ruins the story. The visuals aren't bad but the writers on this project were awful and the acting is even worse. How can people be giving higher than 5\/10 stars when the costumes were poorly made and wigs were as solid as a helmet? (we're looking at princes Yue)\nIt's also sad in cinema when bad child actors are better than some adult actors, but I have a feeling it could also have to do with the script.

{"title":"A Beautifully Crafted Disappointment","review":"The live-action Avatar series had such potential to transport fans to the beloved animated world. However, it became clear early on that the adaptation lacked the heart and vision that made the original so special.At the core of Avatar is the practice of bending, yet the show reduced this complex art to simplistic displays that failed to enhance the narrative or characters. Rather than exploring the cultural depth and philosophy behind each element, it focused on superficial subplots. This was a missed opportunity to further immerse viewers in the rich lore and symbolism.Additionally, the condensed episode count made it difficult to faithfully translate the layered story arcs. Critical relationship-building moments and character journeys felt rushed. While additional exposition was provided, it lacked the subtlety and emotional resonance of the animated telling. Key thematic messages that taught valuable life lessons also seemed to get lost in translation.It is always challenging to adapt a beloved work while also attracting new audiences. But by not prioritizing what made the original a timeless masterpiece - its heart, cultural commentary, and spirit of hope - the adaptation failed to honor both the source material and its loyal fans. With some adjustments to capture more of the animated show's soul, it could have been a memorable journey for both new viewers and longtime fans alike. As it stands, the live-action interpretation sadly did not achieve its potential to inspire in the way the animated Avatar series continues to do so profoundly.","rating":"4\/10","date":"24 February 2024"}

While the actors are of Asian and Indigenous descent, their performances fail to capture the essence of the beloved characters. The emotional depth is lacking, and the show's tone feels disjointed.

Katara's delivery is monotonous, and Uncle Iroh's reading of his lines is rushed and tonally inconsistent. While the visual effects for fire and earth bending are commendable, the air bending appears artificial. The props used seem inauthentic, and the overall aesthetic lacks the appropriate level of wear and tear expected of an ancient setting.Furthermore, the casting of Aang is questionable. His acting skills are lacking, and his timing for the delivery of his lines is off. He portrays Aang as broody rather than the fun-loving character we all grew up with.While I understand the desire to make small changes to the show to make the storyline more cohesive, it is important to maintain the character development that happened in the cartoon series. This is especially important when adapting a beloved children's show into a live-action series.In conclusion, the introduction of the live-action Avatar series raises concerns about the overall quality of the adaptation.

You don't form any connection to the characters cause every relationship the characters form is narrated to you! They cut important backstory of characters with no good reason. One way they mess up is rather then showing us that Aang is a funny, kind-hearted, character they have Aang tell us that in a serious monologue where he is talking to Appa.

Some shots are beautiful, but for the majority of the time there is too much green screen with some more than questionable effetcts. It breaks the immersion. They also missed out on the opportunity to create some beautiful costumes, now they look like cosplay. It's such a shame. I feel bad for the actors that clearly are passionate about the project.

Hes a monk, hes kind,patient,a people person and charming because of his innocence and humanity.In this series hes constantly mistreated and looked down on by his peers and old friends who are adults,which is just shameful.. in the original they taught him lessons,gave him advice and helped him ,each in their unique way. Sokka protects him like a little brother, katarra guides and nurtured him,protecting him as well. Boomie teaches aang valuable life lessons and to think outside the box,he would never talk down to or accuse aang of things beyond his control. They completely jumble to the story together to save screen time, yes i know you cant tell as much as in the cartoon but its empty storytelling with major important plots and details left out..i mean make it 10-12 episodes not 8. The cartoon was 20 ,20 min episodes each season. Most shows are 40 mins,so 10 episodes and you can tell the story just as well! There is almost no humor..its stale and dry and overly serious. It couldnt be as goofy as a cartoon but you can still translate some of it into a real life scenario. Aang does zero water bending, even tho this is book one water lol. They leave out the love story with him and katarra, let me guess thats offensive? Or they will just shuv them together at the end without any story leading up to it? Commander jau isnt bad or out of contriol, hes a nice quiet boring guy. Fire lord ozi is a joke lmao. He burnt his own son to make an example out of him and banished him! He never liked him,he thought he was a a weak loser and azula a cleaver hard working manipulator,who had her fathers attention because they were both messed up,cruel and awful people.its ridiculous the bad changes and soulless story that is presented. Its not the same story,its just a rip off!","rating":"1\/10","date":"28 February 2024"}
{"title":"I did my best to love it","review":"I've been eagerly awaiting the release of this series for a very long time... I really wanted to love it. I did my best to enjoy the first two episodes, but everything became so convoluted in the 3rd, 4th, and 5th episodes that I truly cried because my hopes were shattered. My boyfriend, upon seeing the opening scene of the first episode, said, 'This is going to be a really bad series, they've changed the entire storyline, you'll see.' And no matter how much I tried to defend it, he was absolutely right. The entire storyline had indeed been changed. I believe what made us love Avatar were the side stories. We loved and understood the characters through those side stories. The same goes for the characters themselves. They got to know and love each other in those side stories. It saddened me greatly that almost all of the stories were erased. We didn't get to see any character development, and most importantly, Aang didn't learn to bend even a drop of water. Sokka's character was completely erased. Katara remained very superficial. Suki seemed to be waiting to jump on the first guy she found. Zuko was the only character among the main ones who had a decent performance. Although not entirely Zuko, he resembled the Zuko from the animated series. Also, Dallas's acting was really good. I have nothing to say about the visual effects. They were amazing. I won't compare the series to the movie because this production isn't a film adaptation. I think those who say they liked it because it's better than the movie are very mistaken. You should compare the series to the original, not to another adaptation. In short, Avatar: The Last Airbender is a 3-point series for me. 1 point for visual effects. 1 point for Zuko and Uncle Iroh. And 1 point for the happiness I felt seeing Momo.","rating":"3\/10","date":"26 February 2024"}
{"title":"What a let down.","review":"I wanted to love this. I really, really wanted to love this. As a long time fan of the original show, this was hard to watch. The writing felt very clunky and awkward. They did not capture the humor and fun. It's fine to kick things up a notch and add more action and change things up a little bit, but not for the cost of the soul of the show.The next issue was the acting. It felt like nearly every actor delivered their lines improperly. They seemed timid and awkward. I thought Zuko, Suki and sometimes Sokka were the best portrayed characters. However, there was not enough character development. It felt very rushed.As far as FX goes, it's was incredible. The world building was phenomenal as well. The costumes were pristine, and maybe a little too new looking but that's my only complaint there. The bending was incredible as well, and the fight scenes well choreographed. But that's not the soul of that show, it can't be. The soul is the characters and the way they all intermingled. At the very least the characters need far more time to develop.All in all I'll leave you with this: Anyone else feel like you were watching The Ember Island Players episode for the entire 8 episodes??","rating":"4\/10","date":"29 February 2024"}
{"title":"WE DIDNT NEED THIS","review":"Okay... so where do I begin with this one... I am a very big fan of the animated series. I grew up watching and then rewatching as I got older. Now this TV series comes out, and it's so unnecessary, honestly. The animated story was good because it was animated and had character development and stories. The TV series is cringe and corny. You can see how hard they're trying to make Sokka funny, but the actor that plays Sokka just doesn't do it for me. He is not funny; he feels like he's trying too hard. Katara is boring; you don't feel her warmth, her stubbornness. The actress does not do justice to Katara, and that is sad. The casting, for the most part, besides Zuko, is subpar. Iroh looks and feels like a caricature of a character. It's just nothing like the original story but still wants to be the original story. The costumes are so neat and colorful. I feel like they are all in a big cosplay. I've seen the same costumes at Comic-Con... To make a parallel, look at Harry Potter or LOTR; those costumes look like they are worn every day by the characters. And then the CGI... What can I say about the CGI? It's just horrible... Look, if you're an actual fan of Avatar... don't waste your time. It will make you mad and sad that they butchered something you love.","rating":"1\/10","date":"29 February 2024"}

Here most of the scenes in the first episode looked really fake and CG'ed......never had that feeling watching the movie. I guess Netflix gave them a lower budget.Aang seems a rather cocky boy and I don't like him. I also don't think he's a very good actor. Aang from the movie was a much better fit for this role.I actually couldn't get pas the first two episodes and I have no desire to watch more of it.Can't really comment on the story because I don't know it other then what I know from the movie.

{"title":"Promising visuals but poor execution","review":"Good things first: the CGI, the world's realisation, the element-bending as well as the fight scenes are extraordinarily good. In general, the visuals are simply fascinating, you can definitely see the effort there.But the dialogue, the acting and some directing choices were too poor to actually enjoy the show.The script is awful. Nearly every character expresses itself in an unnatural, vague, prose-like manner. There is no friendship-bonding between these superficial lines, in fact, you do not even get attached to the characters as a viewer. Moreover, the series relies way too much on exposition than actually taking action. Important plot elements happen off-screen, details get explained by characters who happen to be omniscient or major plot points\/ plot twists appear underwhelming and far from epic.The actors' line delivery is so unconvincing, I simply cannot understand some casting choices. Face expressions and emotions are non-existent and there is zero chemistry, charm or easiness to the characters. Due to this lack of charisma, originally goofy characters turn cringe and villains do not feel like serious villains.The camera work sometimes really highlights the lack of acting since there are way too many close-ups of unauthentic face expressions. The director loves these close-ups especially at the end of EVERY. SCENE. When a character states something totally meaningless but in a kind of poetic way, accompanied with way too loud music.The soundtrack itself is very pleasant and my personal highlight was the short intro which differs from episode to episode. But that's it, nothing to recommend.","rating":"4\/10","date":"26 February 2024"}

The mixup of different chapters, stories and characters is really really quite flabbergasting.The CGI is again amazing. Can't say this enough and it's shows where the money went. But after episode 4 we've had it. The acting of Iro and Zoku is very good. Most of the typecasting is well done too. Katara's acting is really unconvincing and you see she has potential but the roll was to big for her to start of with.We quit the episode because of to many crossovers in the episodes even though we thoroughly enjoyed the anime with our whole family.","rating":"1\/10","date":"2 March 2024"}
{"title":"It's ok I guess but not worth investing in.","review":"I'm a fan of the original series and I gotta tell you, it's a complete letdown and extremely disappointing. As always, any idiot who manages to get their money-grubby hands on someone else's IP ruins another creators original creation. The live-action \"Net-remake\" isn't the worst thing ever produced but it's far from perfect and far from redeemed or redeemable. I was captivated by the first fight scene with Aang's village and kind of liked the serious tone at first but realized this doesn't click together. All of the early important key plot points are removed (as mentioned by others) such as Roku being his first avatar contact. Instead it's.... Kyoshi????? Jet brings the Avatar gang into Omashu when, they themselves just walked in with no need of help. The characters don't have much of the life in them compared to this adaptation. It's way better than the 2010 crap bag we got way back then at least but doesn't come close to the same liveliness, fun and adventurous tone as the animated show. And Aang couldn't use his full avatar state powers in the original, yet when on Kyoshi island, he suddenly can. This is basically Star Wars where what's her face had no Jedi training before, but can somehow suddenly mind control stormtroopers. Yeah, just let them have the powers that they HAVE TO TRAIN FOR in the beginning for no reason. Yeah, make absolute no sense. Same thing happen with Korra's story too. \"I'm the avatar, you gotta deal with it!\" \u00f0\u0178\u2018\u02c6 this right here is happening all over again.

You feel nothing watching this hollow performance of what is actually an incredible story. Such a shame that they have utterly failed to capture the essence of the characters and the story. The focus is on action sequences and special effects designed to show off bending skills and wow the audience at the expense of acting talent and character development. The elements of a good story such as empathy with the main characters and exploration human relationships has been overlooked with token efforts only.Unlikely anyone will try again after this travesty unfortunately.","rating":"2\/10","date":"23 February 2024"}

All I want to do after seeing a few episodes, is turn it off and put on the original animated show to fill the emptiness that I feel after watching this. I dont like any of the actors or actresses that they chose to play the characters. I feel like they just rushed to put something together to try and make a some quick cash. No emotion once so ever and just overall a complete waste of time. You are better off skipping this one and just rewatching the original series. Very disappointed. 2\/10.","rating":"2\/10","date":"23 February 2024"}
{"title":"Something felt off","review":"I watched the 1st episode yesterday and something felt off the whole time. I could not put my finger on it, but interestingly, I was able to understand what after I watched \"Enter Magneto\" episode form X-Men animated series from the 90s. There are 2 main things, that I feel \"wrong\".First thing is that there is a lot of talking for the sake of telling things. X-Men from the 90s is dated, for sure, but even that series used little things to tell you more about characters, their emotions, about the world and its rules. Facial expressions are the obvious things: they were exaggerated to make them more obvious due to limitation of the medium, but they worked. In \"Enter Magneto\" Beast is in prison and his intent to stay there is clear way before he actually voices it to Magneto.In the new Avatar? We had something like a 2 minute rant from Aang about how he does not want to be an avatar. His emotions on the matter are clear and understandable, when said out loud, but... There was not that much things shown to really make them believable, to make them have weight. I may be misremembering original show here, but I believe we saw way more little things showing how \"connected\" Aang was to his tribe, how happy he was with it, and... That he was still a child. Original also showed us the guilt that Aang had after learning about genocide, while new adaptation seemingly brushed it off.Second thing is that it's... Too clean. And this is true not only for this show, but for a lot shows and movies in recent decade or so. There is even a good YouTube video about how recent media is too \"clean\". There is practically no dirt or dust or blood or debris anywhere. Everything is just picture perfect, and to me that ruins the immersion.With animation lack of details is understandable: there is a lot of manual work going into each frame even with modern technology, and bringing in the imperfections \"the right way\" is difficult. It is definitely possible (\"Invincible\" adaptation is good at that), but difficult and we understand it almost intuitively, so it does not ruin suspense of disbelief, when we see it. But with live action? Dirtying clothes or skin should not be that difficult, and it can make it more realistic and relatable.There are some other minor things, too. For example, wind does not look as exciting here, simply because it's not as visible. It looks like dust magic rather than wind. They also re-ordered certain things. Not in terms of chronology, but in terms of when a thing is told to the viewers. It does not necessarily make things worse, but it does not bring anything either.This brings me to a thought, that we need to stop with adaptations for the sake of adaptation. When you adapt a story from one media into another you need to elevate it in some way. You can criticize, say, \"Attack on Titan\", \"My Hero Academia\" or \"Demon Slayer\" anime adaptations for quite a few things, but what they did really good, and what really hooked lots of people was that they elevated the respective manga. These adaptations utilized the technics of the new media to make things look exciting, to increase your heartrate, when you see something truly insane.But what has new Avatar brought compared to original? Special effects? I mean, they are not bad, but original show was not about magic, really. Magic was just part of the setting, a tool. Did it bring stellar performance from actors? Yes, it may be to premature to judge based on 1 episode, but I would say no. To be honest, I disagree with majority on \"how good the casting is\". I think only uncle Iroh felt good, but others - kind of \"meh\". Even Gran-Gran looked as if it was a young woman who was aged with make-up.So no, I do not think this is a good adaptation, that everyone was expecting to get. Good thing, that I did not have expectations for it.","rating":"4\/10","date":"24 February 2024"}
{"title":"Even trying not to compare to the animated series, it's still just a bland, lifeless, and clunky tv-show","review":"Even trying to look at this as it's own thing and not compare it to the original animated series, it's still a bland and clunky tv-show, with terrible pacing, dialogue, acting, and overall writing. All of the characters feel flat with little to no agency, the bending and fight scenes feel limited and have no real kick to them. Every single episode someone will just start doing some of the most egregious exposition dumping out of nowhere, the writers for this must have never heard of the show don't tell rule somehow. The pacing is awful, one second the characters are like \"We must get to the northern water tribe, we have no time to waste, we're all business not play now\" and then the next Aang's like \"oh no look down there, some random burnt patch in the woods, better drop everything we're doing and go check out the burnt trees for some reason\". When comparing it to the actual show it's even worse, ever single time something is changed or altered from the source material it's always for the worse, there isn't a single instances where something was done as an improvement, some of the changes don't even make sense half the time. None of the characters other than maybe Aang and Jet feel like the characters their supposed to be playing, half the time they feel like their doing a bad impersonation or parodying the character. And the other half of the time their just straight up not even trying to play the characters, saying and doing things the characters would never do. All in all, I didn't expect much from this show but still, this hurt to watch. I'll give it a full 1 star and not lower just because it is technically a marginable improvement over the movie version.","rating":"1\/10","date":"27 February 2024"}
{"title":"Beautiful visuals... terrible storytelling, scripting and acting","review":"This show's biggest issue is its lack of understanding for the concept 'show, don't tell' and this is made clear within the first 15 minutes of the show and unfortunately doesn't let up for the remainder of the show. Every bit of emotion that is felt by the characters is explained through boring monologues rather than being acted through the various ways that humans actually show emotion (facial expressions, actions etc). Rather than leaving a sense of intrigue and myster, the script insists on spelling out everything for you by telling you everything you need to know.Not helped by the terrible writing is the acting, which is almost as bad (with a handful of moments that are half decent from a select few in the cast - s\/o to Dallas James Liu Zuko for holding it down).The visuals are pretty good! There are moments that I felt looked a little bit artificial at times.. personally I felt that the show needed a slightly more muddy\/gritty look to make things feel a bit more grounded. But, as a whole, I don't personally have any massive issues the visualsI am a big fan of the original animated series. However I also was very open to things being changed and was very keen to see what the live-action equivalent would bring to this! Unfortunately, what it has brought is a rushed, poorly scripted, mediocre-at-best show with some pretty good visuals.If you've never watched the original, watch the original. This doesn't even come close to it in quality. Even taking the original material out of the equation, the most generous score I could ever personally give this is a 5... and that's me being generousIf you've watched the original, just don't watch this... it's not worth it lol.","rating":"4\/10","date":"22 February 2024"}

There was even a word for word play by play script for them to follow. I'm sorry that Micheal and Brian's work got twisted and chopped up when the potential was there. Normally turning an animated series into a live action isn't good but this show really had the potential. It looks amazing but it's things that happened at different times, places put it together and it doesn't work. The changing in character personas and throwing in 'Key Words' is not world building and is not okay. Should have listened to Mike and Brian. But you know. Creative Differences.","rating":"1\/10","date":"24 February 2024"}

It is one of the best animation out there, but folks keep trying to remake it and are failing miserably. For the love of G, just stop please.

Both film crew and production did a really really crappy and stupid job if you ask me. And to sum it all off, I hope they don't renew this series in the near future, and if they do, how about get a better cast for crying out loud. The main leads look like they're about to reach adulthood in less than a year. Overall, a complete of waste.","rating":"1\/10","date":"3 March 2024"}
{"title":"Watched This As A Stand Alone","review":"I think like so many stories that are retold, reanimated and reimagined there are those who have followed them through many iterations. These people are often more forgiving or to the other end of the spectrum, extremely critical if expectations are not met. As a person who has no previous experience with any form of adaptation related to this series, I was looking to be entertained by a decent script, good visuals, enveloping audio and respectable acting. For me the lack of believable acting, by the main character, was what ultimately ruined the whole series. It was played way too childish in my opinion. Fine for a very young audience but lacking for a more mature viewer.","rating":"5\/10","date":"12 March 2024"}

And the show was fast like what happened in GOT season 8. No one forcing netflix to make live action series of famous anime series. Plz don't ruin our loved childhood memories. The show should contain some jaw dropping, impactful scene. But it was like the series completely missing something. I'm totally disappointed after watching this season.

{"title":"Less than meh more than terrible","review":"Good lord the acting and the script is awful. Wow! There was some cool acting but they only have cameos. Meanwhile we are repeatedly abused audibly by the main characters who just hold no depth. Also the lecture on women's right to fight is really old. It sounds good on screen and in Hollywood but it's not glamorous IRL. Sound bites from people who only \"fight\" on scene and then exit stage to comfortably cushioned retreats is not representative of the warrior let alone masters but Hollywood continues to progress this lie to young vulnerable girls (while completely encouraging the disrespect of elders. Cute while young until we become the elders and so I guess we'll know what it feels like to be mocked).... but I digress.The portrayal of Katara and Sokka are the worst. Especially Sokka.

They just had him give out a couple \"cute\" kid like smiles and that's supposed to convince us he has a kid like personality? The entire show he's basically a sad kid that continuously says he's failed everyone.His bending in the animated show season 1 was still very good, in the live action he basically sucked. Also he learns water bending with katana before they reach the north and then he trains with Pakku leading up to the battle. Why'd they just cut all that out?Honestly I can go in on every actor, feel like they did a poor job representing them. The story is fine, more of a knock off version of the animated series but it didn't bother me too much. It was mainly the actors. Uncle Irohs actor wasn't that bad, other than that the rest didn't do the animated show justice.Bending was cool though, feel like they did a good job with that. If they can get better at that in season 2, my rating will probably go from a 4 to a 6. But the actors needs to do better representing the characters. The characters in this show is what made the show.","rating":"4\/10","date":"27 February 2024"}

I'am so much appreciated Zuko and Iroh acting they were absolutely amazing embody their respective roles, the duo's bonding are really neat. While others main characters are not good enough to embody the original that have strong personality I love, Aang was less goofy and playful, Sokka's acting not so comedic he's more serious and stiff, and Katara is stiff as well, the bonding of trio is still lacking, they need more time to learn.Maybe some of us capturing the quality of every single episodes, scenes, and dialogue, in animated series, and that's all was a major problem in this adaptation. Where everything was forced pressing into 8 episodes, there are some point mixed up in one episode, which makes the story lack of quality and less impressive.Plus the fatal change eliminates the issue of sexism which is actually not a problem to deal with so that there are positive change efforts. Also Aang is not shown learning waterbending here, which of course will ruin the quality of the story. Well overal, costumes and CGI is really impressive but still lacks of acting and unnecessary changing, so many characters are all over the place, the hype is so huge, promising with many iconic character but they were doesn't places right.","rating":"3\/10","date":"26 February 2024"}
{"title":"I'm genuinely astonished that the reviews are this good","review":"Having recently viewed the latest installment of the revered Avatar franchise, I am compelled to address the myriad shortcomings that marred its execution, particularly in the domains of casting and technical proficiency.Gordon Cormier's portrayal of Aang stands out as a glaring misstep. Cormier's performance lacks conviction and immersion, with evident struggles to embody the character. The casting choice for Aang leaves one questioning the selection process, given the abundance of potential alternatives overlooked in favor of Cormier's portrayal.Similarly, the casting choices for Katara and Bumi are cause for concern. Kiawentioo's portrayal of Katara veers towards melodrama, lacking the subtlety necessary to fully embody the character. Additionally, the decision to cast a 40-year-old as the 112-year-old Bumi raises eyebrows, underscoring a lack of consideration for age-appropriate casting and detracting from the overall authenticity of the ensemble.While Sokka's portrayal exhibits a modicum of fidelity to the original character, it fails to transcend the limitations imposed by the surrounding mediocrity. Similarly, Zuko's characterization, while not devoid of merit, lacks the requisite intensity and gravitas demanded by the role.In stark contrast, Sun-Hyung Lee's portrayal of Iroh emerges as a beacon of excellence amidst the sea of mediocrity. His nuanced performance elevates the material, imbuing the character with a depth and complexity that transcends the limitations of the script and direction.The deficiencies in casting are further compounded by technical shortcomings, most notably in the realm of CGI. The visual effects fail to meet contemporary standards, detracting from the immersive quality of the viewing experience and further underscoring the production's lack of polish and finesse. It's astonishing to think 20 years on from the LOTR trilogy, we are forced to endure worse visual effects.Moreover, the narrative suffers from pacing issues and a lack of coherence, resulting in a disjointed and unsatisfying viewing experience. Subplots are truncated, character arcs are left underdeveloped, and thematic resonance is sacrificed in favor of expediency and convenience.In conclusion, the latest iteration of the Avatar franchise falls far short of its lofty ambitions, failing to honor the legacy of its predecessors or captivate audiences with its lackluster execution. It is a regrettable misstep in a storied franchise, one that leaves much to be desired in terms of both artistic vision and execution.","rating":"1\/10","date":"29 February 2024"}
{"title":"Only wachable thanks to its source material","review":"This series stumps me. There doesn't seem to be any creative direction other than following the line of live action animes coming out of netflix. The general storyline is fine and the strongest points are owed entirely to the source material with nothing new or interesting coming from it.As for how it looks, I've seen people call this show stunning which blows my mind!This has to be the worst looking show I've sat through since the 90s. The constant awful and merky greenscreening and cg stunts are so bewildering. The city wide shots are probably the only decent cgi at all. Some fight scenes are good, with interesting choreography but the insistence on using medium shots almost exclusively covers most of the action.One last thing. This show has THE worst hair and makeup I've ever seen. The wigs alone are a travesty. Some costumes are FINE but most would be easily outdone by cosplayers.I'd say if I wasn't so distracted by the awful aesthetics, this show would be a decent adoption, but as it is now it can't stand on its own and is completely attatched the the originals legacy.","rating":"5\/10","date":"4 March 2024"}

Just action by action. Feels like they collected shots of different project and joined in one movie. Maybe for people who will watch Avatar first time ever - it will be good, but when you know the real story and saw original cartoon, then it's 4\/10.","rating":"4\/10","date":"6 March 2024"}
{"title":"Great visuals, mediocre characters and acting","review":"The visuals of the bending and scenery are definitely delightful compared to its live-action movie counterpart. Costumes and makeup do well to fit to the theme of the world. Unfortunately, that's where it feels like most of the budgeting went. There is a major lack of connection between the audience and characters. A lot of the delivery in script feel wimped and unnatural. A major component of the animation series was the feeling of a journey and connecting with the characters. The way this live-action is portrayed feels all over the place and there is no linear path to really follow. I hope in seasons 2 and 3; they can work on this. The show has a lot of potential, let's pray they listen to its audience feedback and make necessary changes.","rating":"5\/10","date":"9 March 2024"}
{"title":"a disaster.....","review":".......a disgrace, a joke, an abomination. Horrible acting by most of the cast. Dialogue is robotic and stiff. Important characters just randomly appearing in scenes and never introduced. Storyline happening way too fast skipping so much plot. Then also mixing storylines that never intertwined, which I wouldn't mind if it was well done. This was an abomination to the original. Now I give Shyamalan a pass because he only had a few hours for the movie remake. This series had all the time and decided to make this trash. No wonder the original creator left early into the development. I know Netflix is not quality but a quantity based service, but wow, this was a clown show within a clown show.","rating":"1\/10","date":"2 March 2024"}
{"title":"I am afraid","review":"I hold reservations regarding writers' attempts to reimagine cherished classics. Preserving the integrity of the original source material and respecting the fans who hold it dear is paramount. When adapting such revered shows, it's imperative to approach the task with reverence for their legacy. Without this respect, there's a risk of alienating the very audience the adaptation seeks to engage. Crafting something original is undoubtedly challenging, and altering established narratives can often detract from the unique qualities that made them special in the first place.From the outset, this adaptation of \"Avatar: The Last Airbender\" takes significant departures from its predecessor. Aang's departure from the Air Nomad temple, a pivotal moment in the original series symbolizing his acceptance of the Avatar's responsibilities, undergoes substantial alteration. This change undermines the narrative's core themes of internal struggle, acceptance, and growth, depriving viewers of the profound character development that defined Aang's journey.Furthermore, the portrayal of airbending in this adaptation lacks consistency with the established lore. Aang is presented as a master from the outset, diverging from the original portrayal where airbending was depicted as a skill requiring diligent training and effort. Additionally, the premature depiction of Aang's ability to fly and his connection to the Avatar spirit fails to capture the essence of his character's transformative journey.The alterations to Sokka's character also become apparent early on, particularly in his interactions with female warriors. While Sokka's growth and eventual respect for female warriors unfolded organically in the original series, this adaptation handles it awkwardly, resulting in a disjointed portrayal of his character arc. Moreover, pivotal moments such as Aang's interaction with Kyoshi village lack the nuanced attention to detail present in the original series, diminishing the impact of these crucial scenes.From fundamental narrative changes to character portrayals, it struggles to recapture the essence of what made the original series so beloved. As a fan, I find myself yearning for the authenticity and emotional resonance of the original, missing the familiar dynamics and nuances that rendered it a timeless classic.Though the writers have undoubtedly exerted effort, some details cannot be overlooked. As of now, I have yet to begin the third episode, but my concerns persist.","rating":"4\/10","date":"24 March 2024"}

It keeps B class movie feel all the time. Yet pushing that much American accent seems not a problem for any producer.In the original series It took so much time to see Ozai's face, but this time it was chosen to not keep secrecy.Show is not okay for true Avatar fans.

{"title":"Some People Prefer Junk Food - Probably the same people who think this is good.","review":"Some people like this adaptation, some don't.Some people prefer a delicious, freshly cooked gourmet meal, others are fine with fast food.I could talk at length about the horrendous acting, the lack of fun, the character assasinations, the haphazardly mashed together storylines, the telling vs showing, the nonsensical rearrangement of plot beats, the overly pristine wardrobe, the missing lessons of each story told, the missed opportunities to make itas good or improve upon the original, the omission of important plot points, everything being done worse for the sake of being different.... but I'll let other people handle that.Some people like a rich, wholesome meal, others like fast food. I'd love to say, this show is like Mcdonalds cheeseburger to a fillet mignon, but even a Mcdonalds cheeseburger can taste pretty good despite its lack of nutrients.

They crammed too much into each episode, resulting in numerous storylines being ruined and characters consistently mishandled. Despite starting with an uphill battle, the writers failed to capitalize on many opportunities. Overall, the show was a disappointment from the start. I approached it with an open mind, hoping to enjoy it, but my enthusiasm dwindled rapidly after the first episode, with each subsequent episode only worsening the experience.I would not recommend this show to anyone.

No \"side quests\" that gave depth to characters. No growth. Story is scrambled all over the place. No feeling of attachment between characters - It doesn't feel like they're friends at all.

{"title":"This should've never been made","review":"Netflix's avatar is not good, it's not bad but it's most certainly not good.It is the very definition of mid.The writers cannot write with any subtlety whatsoever, every line is so on the nose.Everything good about the original show has been stripped of its character and barfed out into a darker, grittier, worse version.The kid actors are rough, if only there were a form of media where adults can voice children and actually be emotionally effective, if only.Zuko is literally the only one out of the characters that I cared anything about or believed in any way.I mean I guess it's good that this isn't a kids show so that hopefully less children will be shown this poor rendition as opposed to the near perfect original version.The effects are mostly fine but nothing to write home about and a few shots look pretty bad.If this show was a live action, dark version of the Ember Island Players episode, I would say well done, you nailed it.I would give the first episode a 3.5 out of 10, it's so mid I wish the writers of this show just never attempted this project.","rating":"3\/10","date":"23 February 2024"}

They had the perfect template from the greatest source material of all time and thought somehow they could make it better. The more I think about it the more it seems like complete disrespect for the original and those of us who love it. The changes they made are completely unnecessary and in many cases completely change the characters. The story is changed so much that they should have changed the name of the show to something else. If you loved the original and comics afterwards and are expecting anything like them them just skip this unfaithful and bad adaptation. The only reason I didn't give 1 star is because the bending actually looks good.","rating":"3\/10","date":"24 February 2024"}
{"title":"Another horrible adaptation of a beloved series","review":"Well here we are again folks...another film adaptation of the beloved ATLA franchise that no one wanted or needed. I was suspicious why anyone would attempt such a thing again, especially after the disaster that was the 2010 film. However I tried to remain cautiously optimistic that this new show would be good, especially after the success of One Piece.Unfortunately, I was sorely mistaken. Like many of the older viewers, I watched ATLA when it first aired as a young adult. I loved ATLA then and still love it now. In fact, I consider it one of my favorite TV shows of all time. I wasn't a fan of Korra, but hey to each their own.However after watching the entire first season of this new show, I can say with confidence that it is a stinking pile of hot garbage and an insult to fans of the original series. While there were a handful of good moments in the show, the vast majority of it was so effed up that I spent most of the time laughing and shaking my head in disbelief. This show missed the heart of the original by a mile and instead infused it with a hefty dose of modern politics which is unforgivable.Let's start with the biggest problem of this show - the dialogue. As many other reviewers have stated this series completely lacks the pacing and complexity of the original show. Instead of a well crafted story that slowly unfolds, in this series the characters try to tell the entire story with words instead of actions. Gone is the mystery, well crafted story arcs and character development that made the original show so compelling and drew you into the world it created.With very few exceptions nearly all of the characters speak without any sincerity or passion and are completely at odds with their counterparts from the original series. This show was so poorly written that I was able to guess lines before they were spoken which left me bored and waiting for each episode to end. Most of the dialogue was so flat and one dimensional that it didn't deliver even a fraction of the powerful storytelling that made the original such a beloved classic.That brings me to problem #2 - Member Berries Overload. This show has so many references to the original series that it seriously made me want to vomit since it is shoved down the viewers throats over and over again. In some cases we were given poorly repeated lines word for word from the original show (aka Gran Gran), as well as exactly replicated scenes that were unnecessary. Hey kids, remember the flying ice disk from Katara that almost hit Master Paku? And hey looky there, it's a picture of Flopsy! Dontcha remember Flopsy? Weeee!Problem #3 - Overweight characters and weak martial arts. Now maybe this film was shot in some wide angle format that made the characters look wider, but what gives with how out of shape the vast majority of the cast is? I know the original was a cartoon, but with the exception of Iroh the characters in that show were lean, toned and extremely athletic. But that's not the case in this adaptation.It shouldn't have been too difficult to find actors who were in good shape with visible muscle tone...but most of this cast looks like they have 10-20 lbs of post virus weight to lose. Even the guy playing Zuko looks a bit chunky and doesn't have a super toned physique. Mai and Ty Lee are both short and plump with chubby faces...seriously what is the deal here? We also don't see them do anything but stand around and talk. The few exceptions are the guy playing Sokka who looks great, as well as Daniel Dae Kim as Ozai who also looks very fit and athletic.That brings me to another related point which is the poor quality of the fighting and martial arts. The original show had each element based on a specific martial art and they had the animators actually study the arts they were drawing. This attention to detail combined with the power of bending made ATLA really come alive.But in this adaptation, most of the characters are simply waving their arms around and that attention to detail of their movements resembling specific martial art techniques is inconsistent at best. Most of the bending looks like dancing instead of fighting and is augmented through CGI, green screens, odd camera angles and an overuse of slow motion. It quite simply looks horrible and the vast majority of the actors simply aren't up to the task of making the fighting scenes convincing.Which begs a serious question...why did they pick so many actors with poor physical conditioning and lack of martial arts ability? Funny thing, after watching the show I learned that the actor who plays Sokka is actually a skilled martial artist in real life. But instead of showcasing his ability he's outshined by the women at just about every turn and whines about his lack of skill as a warrior? No words.The most egregious example is their casting choice for General Iroh. Paul Sun-Hyung Lee was great in Kim's Convenience, however no pun intended, he's way out of his element here. Paul is completely miscast and I would've loved to have seen an older and seasoned martial artist such as Sammo Hung or Jackie Chan take on the role. Instead of a thoughtful, wise and powerful old man badass like the original, in this series Iroh barely does any bending and spends most of his time talking about his feelings. To make matters worse, he even gets beat up several times which was cringe worthy to say the least.The CGI on the bending is also a mixed bag. While the fire and earth bending looks great (air bending is also decent), the water bending is just missing something and looks weak and ineffective. Not sure what they were going for here, but in my opinion the water bending just plain sucks.Problem #4 - Super Boss Girl Power and Introducing Katara - The Last Waterbender\nIf the above examples weren't bad enough, the writers also turned our favorite headstrong and lovable Katara into a soulless girl boss. Her dialogue is some of the worst in the show, and she has such a bad case of power creep she could give Rey Palpatine lessons. In just a matter of weeks with just an old scroll and some pep talk from Jet she becomes a water bending master? Seriously?And don't get me started on the scene where she gets all of the women from the Northern Water Tribe to join in the fight against the Fire Nation. Funny that we don't see any of them lying dead after the fight, do we? Katara also heroically saves the day in several scenes, including one that was done by Aang in the original series when she's just barely able to water bend. This version of Katara steals the show from Aang at every opportunity and is about as interesting as a plank of wood.The same goes for Princess Azula. Instead of a lean and mean ass kicking machine, she's another cherub faced overweight kid who looks miscast and can't be taken seriously. In this version Azula is a spoiled whiner with Daddy issues and her character is completely unconvincing. The actress that plays her needed to spend a little more time in the gym\/dojo and looks about as lethal as a girl scout.The female characters in the original had depth and purpose and their character development along with their male counterparts is what made the animated series so good. But they've taken that all away in this version by powering up the women and weakening the men to make the ladies look better. I don't know how many more franchises will need to flop before more writers and producers realize this is a great way to alienate a large segment of your audience.Speaking of which...let's talk a little about our boy Aang.Problem #5 - Aang Sucks\nAang is next to useless in this show. We never see him practicing or training and he only sticks with his air bending unless he's in the avatar state. Aang doesn't even try to learn water bending because God forbid he's shown as a natural and upstages Katara like the original show. Instead, Aang spends most of the time talking about how useless he feels and only does any serious bending in the finale. I did enjoy the scenes with Monk Gyatso, but beyond that I found the actor that played Aang annoying and missing the mark by a mile. And don't get me started on how they sidelined Appa and Momo...they're pretty much just props in this show.To sum up, this show may look like the ATLA we know and love, but the heart and soul of the original show has been lost and replaced with nothing of substance. Only a handful of times did I feel drawn into the story but it just wasn't enough to hold my interest for more than a minute or two.There's more I could rant about, but I think I've covered my major gripes. I can't see how anyone could call this show good with a straight face and shame on the writers and producers for making yet another terrible film adaptation of one of the best TV shows of all time.","rating":"3\/10","date":"28 February 2024"}

Really, why?In the first episode, when he decides to sneak out and goes into a psychotic monologue i just quit watching.It was after that that i went to find out some info about the production and read that diMartino and Konietzko quit the project.

I got so mad watching this show I could hardly handle it. So many of the amazing filler episodes were ruined by taking bits and pieces and shoving them into other episodes. Though all the scenes were beautiful, the cast was extremely well chosen, and all the costumes were true to the show, and the titles made it easy to keep up with the story line are very much appreciated.

{"title":"Disappointing","review":"As someone who had watched and loved the original animated TV show and hated the M. Night movie version: I think this Netflix series is another failed attempt at a supposedly \"decent\" and \"improved\" adaptation of the ATLA universe. It's promising at some point, but mostly frustrating on so many levels. They've made it look cheap for a high-budget production and turned it into a school play.They're doing the same wrong things over and over again as the other adaptation did-they're rushing the plot too much and adding a lot of things to it that don't even make any sense at all.The dialogues were so poorly written, and the delivery and acting were unbearable and painful to watch. Worse of all, some of the characters didn't even sound, behave, or resemble their supposed roles; it's like they've just cast some random folks and got it over with.I can't help but hate it.

Surely we've they've learned this lesson by now? Maybe it's just a money thing these days, which is a shame.But Netflix, what is it with you and finding even half-decent directors or writers? There's just absolutely nothing memorable about this show.If you love the original animation, be prepared to be seriously let down. It's a cringe fest.","rating":"4\/10","date":"24 February 2024"}
{"title":"abysmal!","review":"The live-action adaptation of \"Avatar: The Last Airbender\" started off with some promise, but unfortunately, it didn't live up to the standards set by the original animated series. As the episodes progressed, it became evident that the storytelling quality was declining. The later seasons seemed to struggle with maintaining coherent plotlines, and the character development felt rushed and lacking in depth.A significant issue with the live-action adaptation was the portrayal of key characters like Azula, Mai, and Fire Lord Ozai. These characters were central to the narrative and were pivotal in shaping the story's direction in the animated series. However, in the live-action adaptation, the actors' performances fell short of capturing the essence of these characters. Azula, in particular, lacked the menacing presence and psychological complexity that made her character so captivating in the original series.Moreover, the live-action adaptation failed to replicate the vibrant animation, exciting fight scenes, and subtle humor that were hallmarks of the original series. Instead, it felt like a watered-down version that failed to capture the magic that made the animated series so beloved by fans.Overall, the disappointment with the live-action adaptation stemmed from its inability to do justice to the source material. It failed to capture the essence and charm of the original series, leaving fans feeling let down by the missed opportunity to translate the beloved world of \"Avatar: The Last Airbender\" into a successful live-action format.","rating":"2\/10","date":"23 February 2024"}
{"title":"Disappointed, yet sadly not surprised.","review":"I'm trying remain optimistic as I continue to watch the live action Netflix rendition of Avatar: The Last Airbender, but I find myself struggling to stay positive.Visually it's certainly not perfect, but not terrible either.The use of CG is well done for the most part (aside from a few gripes), especially when considering the obvious restrictions present when using real people to showcase the detail of an animated series.The casting itself however cannot be given any latitude.At least to me, the choices are poorly chosen; which is sadly a recurring theme these days.(The Last of Us, anyone?)\nThe acting is also very substandard, as character entrances\/introductions aren't seamless, and performances feel scripted, and stale, and at times unnecessarily rushed.I understand that these actors are young and new, but their facial expressions and emotional attempts are sometimes so unbelievable, that it becomes impossible to ignore.Notably, the comedic aspect of the series is almost non-existent so far, and so I find myself confused as to how the removal of one of the most important components in the overall narrative, could've been seen as even vaguely appropriate.Character representation, behaviours, personalities, and even voice impressions, tones, and pitch are well off.The latter being something I never thought I would find so distracting.Yet I definitely do.There are characters (Iroh and Zuko for example) that had very distinctive voices that should have been imitated as best as possible.Additionally, costume design seems a bit too fresh and new, and not nearly weathered enough for people living in these harsh environments.Certain scenes and line deliveries are also frequently and oddly subtle, when they should be much more direct, and blunt, and coarse.The story also isn't exactly accurate; which is to be somewhat expected I suppose, but at times I still find many of the direction choices to be overly contrived.Important plot points found in the animated series are often omitted, and key scenes, conversations, and details either aren't included, or not explained well enough to establish the connection many fans felt as the original series had progressed.To condense the story (presumably), what is shown is occasionally presented out of sequence and seemingly much earlier than expected.In addition, thus far, both scene and character development feels too quick, and extremely flat, and forced...and the actors somehow seem younger than they should be despite the probability that in real life, they're likely of similar age to the anime lore.When studios alter characters and genres, and misrepresent environments, relationships, interactions, connections, and overall content, it's easily interpreted by the public as nothing less than a crippled version of a beloved series.Therefore, creators must be very careful to remain diligent in their efforts to deliver more than just nostalgia, to an unwavering, unforgiving community of fans that will always expect nothing short of perfection.So I guess then it goes without saying, that although I'm hopeful for at least some improvement with each episode, currently I'm inevitably left with no alternative but to express my disappointment within this somewhat brief review, and leave you with this final thought.As it is, it's difficult to see this show as a proper representation that's realistically worthy of any serious praise.Although I'm fairly certain it'll receive it elsewhere anyway...but in spite of this, I feel compelled to say that just once I'd like to see a live action interpretation, that is true enough to the source material to be considered a genuine, worthwhile watch for the many passionate fans with a hedonistic view of the original release, and as a result, a zero tolerance approach to anything less in its adaptations.","rating":"2\/10","date":"23 February 2024"}

In this live action her chart is bland, she lacks emotions even when bending she doesn't show her warrior spirit or her desire to help people. Also Aang is too serious, they missed the part where he is childish and doesn't want any responsibility.

{"title":"Storytellers seem to underestimate the intelligence of the audience...","review":"The Netflix adaptation of the popular animated series Avatar fails to deliver on its promise of a captivating story. The writing is overly saturated, with everything revealed in the first few minutes. The story seems to cater to older audiences, but the storytellers seem to underestimate their intelligence and treat them like infants. The acting is mediocre, with actors flubbing words and the delivery sounding canned. The adaptation has stripped characters of life, ignored key themes, and watered down development. The characters are boring and infallible, with actors lacking chemistry. The over dependence on CGI sets and lack of clear limits on bending make the show unappealing. The costumes are well designed but unlived in, and the characters look ugly and unreal.

I would be furious if I did care at all about this Aang, but there is no space to get to know him at all - the show just bombards you with insiders from the original, badly retold.Quit the show after this - and I'd recommend leaving this one in the bin with the other one. Not worth it and hurting the original.","rating":"3\/10","date":"25 February 2024"}
{"title":"Insulting","review":"The issue with this series isn't that it differs from the source material, it's that it utilises the source material so poorly that you begin to wonder whether this whole project resulted from incompetence or genuine malice.Characters, especially the main cast, are devoid of both all flaws and likeable qualities that were present in the original. This isn't because the series has a new take on these characters, it's because characterisation of any kind has been avoided like the plague. Character arcs aren't different, they're simply missing. I would say the characters are used as pawns to further the plot, but implying that there was any attempt to create a coherent narrative would be dishonest.If you're a fan of quality dialogue, avoid this series like its characters avoid human conversations. Every character functions as a narrator who occasionally spells out their exact feelings when they tire of describing everything that's occuring around them. Rest assured, if there's ever a moment in which a character gives a knowing look to another, all feelings will be verbalised in the very next moment, which will feel like an eternity.Even with all the time and money that was presumably saved by not needing to write anything of substance, the show runners weren't able to make the characters *look* good either. At best, the costumes are decent but distractingly precise and clean, and at worst, you can Google 'Character Name cosplay' to see better attempts.I truly do not understand why some people have praised the effects. If you watch only the opening 5 minutes of the first episode, then the CGI is satisfactory. However, if you sit through more than that (which I wouldn't recommend) you'll understand how breathtakingly horrible it really gets. There are many, many instances of CGI that make M. Night Shyamalan's awful Avatar adaptation from 2010 look like Avatar: The Way of Water. Whenever you're lucky enough to witness effects that aren't hidden in poor lighting, you quickly realise what a blessing that darkness was.The way they've adapted elemental bending is genuinely quite sad. Save for the occasional jump or flip, most of the bending in the series boils down to lobbing an element at an enemy with no technique involved. At multiple points in the show, fire benders win fights because their opponents simply decide not to use their bending anymore. They may as well be using energy blasts given how irrelevant the elements are in combat. There *are* some stand-out fights that come close to capturing the fluidity of the original, but even those aren't quite up to scratch. In the original series, bending had weight to it; you could remove the elements being used and tell which element they were bending based on their gestures and movements alone. Technique was paramount, and the martial arts influences were clear. None of that spectacle makes it into this shoddy adaptation, unfortunately.I can't in good conscience give a rating above the minimum, because that would imply this series might in some small way justify its own existence. I might inadvertently delude people into thinking that even if it's worse than the original and lands on its face, it might at least be an earnest and passionate attempt at a live action adaptation. It isn't.For my own sanity, I cannot believe that someone put effort into making this. There was no vision, and it's no mystery why the original creators left the project.","rating":"1\/10","date":"23 February 2024"}
{"title":"It's better than the movie.. but","review":"If you are to attempt a live action remake of one of the most beloved show you have to understand that there are key moments and character traits you can not remove.Example right in the first episode of the original when Aang emerges from the ice, the first thing he says to Katara is \"Will you go penguin's sledding with me\" this line tells the audience that he is just a kid and wants to have fun!! That's before he even considered \"where he was\" if he is in danger or not.. That was stripped from the show.. why?Also Sokka In the original was a witty warrior who protected everyone innocent regardless of what nation they're from!! Again in the first episode all his witty jokes are stripped and he is just a straight up responsible person.. example, in the Netflix remake when Zukko was demanding that they give up the avatar, Sokka wanted to give him to Zukko, Katara was the one who had to convince him not to but protect him... the OG Sokka will never do this..\nI know it's a little change as in the original he sent him away from the village but that was after he did something that deliberately put the village in danger! Understand he did not cowardly want to give away to the enemy but instead sent him away..I was so disappointed with the change in Sokka's character as he is one of my favourite in ATLA.. he is a witty warrior without any bending powers but still holds his own!! The witty jokes are a massive vital trait of his character!! To strip that away from him is criminal..However Zukko was fantastic!! The bending was amazing, felt like it was real!!Maybe because I am big original ATLA fan who had high hopes after the movie we will never speak of. So if the Netflix remake is your introduction to the gang then you might like it!!! However, I recommend you to watch the original.. I did again for the 200th time after watching this!","rating":"1\/10","date":"24 February 2024"}
{"title":"Disappointing","review":"It is possible to see the writers' commitment to the series, despite its flaws. At various times there is a need to throw what is happening in the viewer's face, over time it becomes annoying. The change in the show's humor and the characters' personalities is also a bit disturbing, which greatly affects the characters' personal development. The TV show gets the script adaptations right, it is capable of telling a lot of stories in a \"short period of time\". The CGI does not disappoint, it is well done, especially in the construction of the environments, but the computer graphics are still noticeable in several environments.","rating":"5\/10","date":"28 February 2024"}
{"title":"Cheesy","review":"I had high hopes for this series but lost interest by the middle of the second episode. I'll preempt this by saying I've never watched any of the air bender cartoons. This series was chock full of cliche learning lessons. \"Everyone is so wonderful and and talented and great and learn to look within themselves and be strong!\" Everyone is a cheerleader and a pychologist for each other. These parts were super slow. I think this would still be a great kid show, which is probably the intention. I think I hurt myself rolling my eyes at the cheesiness of it. I couldn't get past the 3rd episode. The acting is ok. I must say the costuming was fantastic though! I also enjoyed most of the action scenes.","rating":"3\/10","date":"7 March 2024"}

{"title":"Im totally dissapointed","review":"This show had a lot of potential.. they could use books or Animated TV series.. instead they did what Netflix does best, and that is screw everything up... Dong get me wrong, i realy loved those animations, but today anyone can do good animations, even me.. But what they did really wrong was when they decided that its great idea to put 20hours or more of content into less than a 10 hour series..There was no character development at all.. They made Aang wanting to save the world and not wanting to play and be a kid.. which made him look weird.. he tried to be so mature but yet he was still just a kid.. in animated ATLA he developed into that persona.. he lost friends, saw people die, cities being burned down.. in Netflix adaptation he just jumped out of ice and started being serious from the beggining.. there is no character development for Aang and wont be...Same for Katara, she is master waterbender at the end of the series, like literally, they call her Master Katara... But thats becouse they wanted to squish one whole book worth of at least 20 episodes into 8 episodes..And that brings me to \"loving\" the characters.. there is only one character in the whole series i really loved.. and that was Fire Lord Ozai... I could not find a way to anyone else (Iroh was really close though) but thats becouse of acting.. Acting in this series was like acting for 7yo kids.. and i know it was supposed to be a show for kids, but even animated series was better voiced than this acted...And again this leads me to another section, choice of actors.. they did great with Aang, Zuko, Iroh, Ozai and maybe Azula.. but the rest.. oh god.. Ty Lee and Mai were tereible choices.. and Sokka reminds me of that one episode of ATLA where team avatar watched in fire nation their own parody show..All and all this show feels exactly like that episode... Its just like one big parody of the golden Avatar: The Last Airbender - Animated series\/books.","rating":"4\/10","date":"19 March 2024"}
{"title":"Netflix just needs to stop touching shows.","review":"Almost everything they've touched is ruined.Positives:\nSome characters were well casted.The bending was much better than the movie that we don't talk about.Negatives:\nSome characters were not well casted.The story has been changed that made me stop watching it.I can't believe they decided to change a perfectly good story. What exactly was problematic about bringing the animation to live action? The bending? Nope. The story? Yes.Everything going down the path of girl boss and passive boys is just a shame and disrespect to the animation.If you want to do girl boss and passive boys, just make your own show and stop trying to ride the success of originals.","rating":"2\/10","date":"27 February 2024"}
{"title":"Disappointed but not surprised","review":"I'll start off by saying I didn't have a lot of hope going into this. Being a huge fan of the original series, and knowing what a catastrophe the 2010 movie was, I was really skeptical.I was initially really impressed with the visuals and special effects. The locations are gorgeous, the bending looks believable and natural, the fight scenes are well choreographed, even the flying bison looks halfway decent.But immediately the writing\/acting fell flat. It's like they spent all their money in shooting and producing, and didn't have anything left for actors and writers (arguably the most important pieces of a quality show).The dialogue is stale and forced. The actors are emotionless and there's hardly any character development. They've completely lost the humor and quirkiness of the show. They muddled up and rushed the timelines in order to fit so much into 8 episodes.It just leaves sooo much to be desired, especially if you are a fan of the original. It's frustrating that it could be really fantastic, but completely lacks any soul. How can you have a nearly perfect series to base this off of and miss the mark in so many areas? No wonder the original writers left.I honestly hope it gets a second and third season and the producers do a better job at mimicking all the little nuances we loved about the cartoon.Like... it could be so good...Also this is literally the first review for a series\/movie I've ever made. But I just finished ATLA and I couldn't help but voice my opinion. I'm glad to read so many others felt similarly.","rating":"5\/10","date":"25 February 2024"}
{"title":"Upon all that budget you still deliver this trash","review":"I really expected the show to be good regarding the budget of this show but after watching the entire series I was not just dissatisfied but annoyed except Zuko and his uncle everything thing about this show is lacking the characters of Aang and Katara are underdeveloped you don't feel the chemistry it feels forced. Sokka and Sukki get intimate a bit too early and they over potray Avatar Kyoshi. The is no humor. Every joke is bad apparently and the heart is not there. I will still like to see a season two though because it has a little potential since they can adapt from this failure. Try and bring emotions to this show.","rating":"1\/10","date":"27 February 2024"}
{"title":"it's so bad, i'm so tired","review":"This is the second time I'm writing this review. The first draft was so negative that I felt the need to retry. THIS is the positive version.A good remake makes changes in service of a new perspective. Things like making the humor more bleak, adding more physical violence and brutality, changing the tone of a sad scene to make it happier and more hopeful; changes that serve to further some fresh artistic perspective. On some base level, pretty much everyone gets this; it's hard to find people that truly want a 1:1 remake of any property, because it's boring! The creative team behind this seems to have understood this too, but only insofar as to shuffle things around with zero care or creativity. They achieve this near-impossible feat by, very smartly, having an AI version of Michael Bay rewrite the script of the original, and then slap-chopping that script. What humor there is here feels like comedy done by hostages with guns pointed at their heads, and any drama is undercut by the script having characters vent like they're talking to their long-time therapist. Nothing is left to interpretation, nothing is clever or witty--The adventurous spirit of the original has been cast away in favor a big, empty nothing with a select few attention-grabbing fight scenes.The most troublesome part of this show is its pacing. The new series is over 3 hours longer than the first season, most of which is spent on extended dialogue scenes and some new stuff (suffice it to say, none of that time was used well). How this remake manages to be nearly twice as long with half the content, I cannot say.In in all, there is nothing of value to be gleaned from this, nothing even remotely interesting that is not done more eloquently by the original. My favorite change was making Azula actually 13, it actually did kind of add something to the story, if not on purpose. So much creative costuming and set design totally wasted. If you like Transformers movies, you might like this.","rating":"2\/10","date":"16 March 2024"}
{"title":"Too rushed and lacks depth, also inconsistent with the original story","review":"The story and character introductions or even places of events aren't in line with the original series.It feels like key points of the original series are just scattered here and there and everything just happens suddenly without the story and meaning behind them.Also there's not much room for character growth when events happen three times as fast as they should.Goofiness that defined Aang in the old series is completely gone, and everything in general feels way too formal and serious. Not that a serious feeling series is a bad thing as itself, but it's definitely not what i hoped of ATLAB.Visual effects are on point though, better than i ever imagined. Pretty much the only thing that's really worth giving appreciation.Disappointed for sure.","rating":"5\/10","date":"25 February 2024"}
{"title":"What is it with Netflix's obsession with making every adaptation more dramatic than the original?","review":"One of the reasons why Avatar AtLA was so good originally was because it was a beautifully sad story enveloped in a hilarious chaotic shell.I understand they wanted to change the target audience, but adults love laughing too.In the show, Aang keeps saying how he \"loves to have fun\", and despite that, they have cut out ALL the scenes where Aang is silly, like with the penguin sliding and the fight in the snow. Even his tantrum that triggered him leaving the air temple was actually not a tantrum in the show, it was a very contained \" I have to go up to think about it calmly\". What kind of 12 year old thinks like that??Sokka's sulky and grumpy personality has been completely erased, he hasn't complained even once! Same for Appa whose sleepiness is gone.Sokka and Katara don't argue like normal teenager siblings would, instead they always have these extremely serious discussions about how they didn't have parents and blablabla.Meanwhile the exposition is done in such an unnatural way, gran-gran becoming the main exposition dumper.It's not are no big hits in Hollywood with comedies. The D&D movie was great in that sense, so were Guardians of the Galaxy, and Umbrella Academy. All of these movies and shows have extremely silly main characters who always attract trouble and deal with it while having fun and creating a huge chaos around them at all time, for the most childish reasons.Aang could have been this type of character, but no, they had to change him into this one dimensional character who is serious and spiritual and can't afford to be silly because he has too much on his shoulders.This first episode was a huge disappointment. I will watch the second one just in case but my hopes are now very low.","rating":"4\/10","date":"23 February 2024"}

{"title":"Mediocre acting by teenagers","review":"\"Avatar: The Last Airbender\" has garnered a significant fanbase, but I find myself unable to join the chorus of praise. While the series has its merits, it ultimately falls short of the expectations set by its enthusiastic following.One major drawback is the pacing of the storyline and weak portrayal of Avatar. The narrative often feels uneven, with some episodes dragging on while others rush through important plot points. This inconsistency disrupts the overall flow of the series and makes it challenging to stay fully engaged.Character development, while present, leaves something to be desired. Some characters, particularly the secondary ones, lack the depth and complexity that would have made them more compelling. It feels as though the writers missed opportunities to explore the backstories and motivations of certain characters, leaving them one-dimensional and forgettable.The resolution of the series left me wanting more. Without delving into spoilers, the ending felt somewhat rushed and didn't provide the closure or satisfaction I had hoped for after investing time in the show.In conclusion, \"Avatar: The Last Airbender\" has its merits, but it falls short in terms of pacing, character development, and consistent humor. While it may have resonated strongly with some audiences, it failed to live up to the hype for this viewer, leaving a sense of disappointment that overshadows its positive aspects.","rating":"5\/10","date":"27 February 2024"}
{"title":"Too many changes","review":"There's a whole animated series to follow and they decided to just shove a bunch of random episodes together into storylines that's don't make sense. I'm a huge fan of the animated series and found this to be very disappointing.Episodes 2 and 3 decided to combine the timelines of at least half a season, pulling storylines from season 2 as well. This created a confusing series of events that happened out of order and introduced too many characters at one time. It's frustrating, it would've been so easy for them to follow the animated episodes, there was no need for this many changes.We stopped watching after episode 3.","rating":"2\/10","date":"8 March 2024"}
{"title":"No. Just no.","review":"I'm gonna keep it short. Besides the visuals this is one of if not the worst adaptation of any show that I have watched. I would stoop low enough to say that I'd prefer the old movie over this. Nothing against the actors themselves but the only good actors in this were the side characters. The story in the first 2 episodes is ok and then it explodes and the rest of the series makes 0 sense. It's like the writers didn't watch the original and made this based off of snippets from other people. Everything is out of order. They didn't capture anything in the correct way. The only thing better than the old movie is the fighting and visuals. It took everything in me to actually finish watching all the way through. One of the hardest things I've tried to watch. I hope the actors take it as a lesson to improve on themselves and practice their skills. To put it plainly, there is no part of this that is correct. All of the lore is messed up. Save yourself the trouble and just avoid this one.","rating":"1\/10","date":"28 March 2024"}

The avatar character in this new show comes across as very lame and excessively childish. The small talk scenes drag on far too long, becoming incredibly tedious (a typical flaw of many TV shows in this level).My recommendation is to save yourself the time and skip watching this remake altogether. Instead, stick with the superior original 2010 movie and the beloved animated series - those are the true gems worth revisiting in my opinion.The special effects are okay, but repetitive and not as engaging as predecessors.","rating":"3\/10","date":"24 March 2024"}
{"title":"A remake without the heart of the original","review":"As someone who has adored the original ATLA cartoon for years, I was pretty disappointed in what the live action remake had to offer. The casting is pretty on point, the settings are gorgeous, and there are a couple narrative changes that enhanced the story, but I'm afraid it didn't make up for what felt like too many poor writing decisions along the way.Where I feel this adaption lacks is in the overall story, characters, and presentation of it all. I can admire the dedication to the original in keeping so many of the background characters and plot points that spur the first season on, but it was so rushed at times in the live action that it felt like the heart of why these aspects of the show existed initially was wiped out all together. Many side characters, important items, and the like are put in the show, but lose all meaning because they no longer provide chances for character growth or for relationships to develop (friendships, romantic relationships, family relationships, etc). I don't mind the fact that they changed these parts of the show, but because there was no replacement for that development, the characters were very lacking and boring. I was also disappointed that several main characters lost their character flaws, again, making them more boring to watch, and harder to relate or learn from, because they don't seem to be learning much themselves.Additionally, I'm not a fan of how this adaptation has chosen to present the ATLA narrative. There were many interesting scenes, there were many more that felt forced, unapplicable, or took away tension and intrigue that I loved seeing in the cartoon. I am comparing it to the cartoon primarily because I feel it did very well in this aspect of storytelling, but overall, the live action just feels dull. Many secrets are revealed to the characters and the audience much too soon. I don't feel like I'm experiencing the story with the characters and discovering a strange world full of war and turmoil and magic and wonder, but rather, I am being told exactly what's going on and expected to remain intrigued. A big part of this comes from many adult characters in the series simply telling the main team what to do or think, rather than working with them. One adult character even needs to be berated by Aang, who is 12 years old and should not need to play the role of the mature mediator to this figure, especially in a moment where Aang could have learned something for his own character growth.While I'm grateful the characters look their age and feel like kids at times, they don't have the complex emotions and behaviors of children and teens that the cartoon did quite well in presenting because it took a lot more time to focus on who the characters are. That being said, the first season of the ATLA cartoon was slow, but at times, that slowness gave more opportunities for characters to grow and the audience to grow attached to characters as they entered more dire situations later on. This live action adaptation feels like an overcorrection of that slow pace to the point that it's hard for me to really know or care about the characters.Ultimately, I know a lot went into this remake and I can respect that, but the heart and soul of ATLA is the characters, the storytelling, and how they interact in this incredible world of bending, and I feel much of that was lost in this remake that I hope can be improved in future seasons.","rating":"4\/10","date":"8 March 2024"}

Appa has become a side note even though there was no one more important to Aang. Don't even get me started on how they portrayed Bumi. He never had malice toward Aang he just was trying to teach him to look beyond the norm.It is painfully obvious why Bryan Konietzko and Michael Dante DiMartino left the project.Yeah the bending is pretty good and worlds better than the M.

As most of the characters are kids or teenagers, it is acceptable, but unfortunately, the bad writing and poor direction didn't help.But to me, the most frustrating thing came from the fact that the series didn't give me any Asian\/Eastern vibe at all. Whether it is the music, environments, costumes, cast, or dialogues... everything almost felt like cultural appropriation but based on stereotypes only, and adapted for an Occidental audience.Having mixed-race actors didn't help, as they really didn't fit in the costumes.

However it's visually stunning. Action sequences are well crafted. These guys are trying to mask the bad outtakes with the visuals and actions. It's not true to the original anime. I guess thst why the OGs left the production. The original anime is one of a kind and suitable for kids and adults alike. This version maybe ok for first time viewers and kids who don't watch anime.

The stages, bending and costumes are great!In my opinion there are two major flaws with this series.The first flaw is that the characters don't feel like the characters in the animation. Especially the main character Aang. In the animation Aang was fleeing from his responsibilities and wanted to travel the world to have fun with his friends. That whole reason to travel the world is gone. This also means that a big part of his story arc is gone as well. There is much less growth. You see this with other characters as well. They just seem to be able to do stuff. Or it is not shown that they learn, but it is told through weak conversation. Basically the character development is gone, while good character development was what made the animation so great.The second flaw is logic. This show often doesn't make sense if you haven't watched the animation. Aang is told several times that he should be responsible, but doesn't show that he is not. Bumi slides down the logistics system with Aang, but why? In the animation it makes sense, since there is history of Aang and Bumi doing that. In the live action it just happens without reason.Also, from the beginning Aang is told that he has to master all forms of bending, but he doesn't do one single bit of waterbending. I sure hope not that in the next season he suddenly mastered it, but seeing the show that probably would happen.Next to that, Katara becomes a master out of nowhere. It just feels rushed, the characters are not well developed and it doesn't make sense.Now there are some other things wrong, like a lot of the acting is bad and they often tell what's going on instead of showing it. That combined with the fact that the logic is way of and the character arcs are bad (which was one of the main selling points of the animation), make for a disappointing series.I probably will watch the next seasons, since I'm a big fan of the animation and I'm just too curious. But for now I'm just happy we still have the animation and the live action is just a disappointment compared to that.","rating":"4\/10","date":"29 February 2024"}
{"title":"And yes two stars is being generous","review":"They have cut so much from the original anime version that is no longer really fun to watch I will say one thing they did get a great actors to play two different characters well maybe I should change that to three but I'm still out on ozai because you don't see enough of him to make it worthwhile but but the actress who play iroh Uncle iroh and and soca both play their parts to the best of their ability and to be honest considering how much has been butchered they make their characters believable enough and as identical as one can imagine to the original but the humor and a lot of the other things have been cut out it's as if somebody did a Frankenstein here but it has no soul my kids didn't watch it because they felt that if the two guys who this was their baby and now Netflix basically was planning to butcher it and that's why they left the deal they decided that it might not be worth watching I was bored and decided to watch it just out of boredom the way it has been butchered makes absolutely no sense we see the some of the characters that we see in the original but the storyline the almost every aspect that made the original not just fun to watch but it's made sense when you were watching it is gone from here unless you've seen the original and you know what's going to happen or what should be happening you wouldn't be able to make heads or tails of this mess giving it to Stars was being generous on my part and only because I saw two actors in there who were really fantastic at playing their part even though their part had been turned into a cardboard figurine they still try to make it sing and dance as if it wasn't and that says a lot about those actors pity one can't say the same about the show entirely and two stars is being generous. I hope this makes sense I can barely see out of the one eye that's working right now and I don't have the hands to type things the way I would like so I'm using voice to text please bear that in mind because it doesn't allow me to punctuate or spill things as I would like to it spells and punctuates the way it wants to and that should say everything. My opinion is don't bother to watch this go back to the original you won't miss anything that way.","rating":"2\/10","date":"27 March 2024"}
{"title":"Nothing special","review":"I've finished the series now and I have to say it's better than the movie.Unfortunately that doesn't mean much.I thought the effects were mostly successful and they even retained some of the original voice actors (I saw it in German). Unfortunately, the cast is only partially good. A few are good (Aang, Katara, Sokka, Suko), but a few unfortunately not so good (Azula + her gang and Iroh).I'm also not happy with Ozai's portrayal, but that's due to the writing. Zhao didn't really do a good job either.All in all, the series is mediocre and it really only raises one question for me: Why does this series exist when there is already an almost perfect series about it?","rating":"4\/10","date":"24 February 2024"}
{"title":"Wasted Potential","review":"Ok I'm gonna start this off with a positive note and recognize what they did well, because there isn't a lot. The sets and scenes are beautiful, they did a wonderful job bringing the different locations from the cartoon to life. The casting was done pretty well, most characters looked pretty similar to their originals, and they did a good job with their all Asian cast. The bending looks pretty good as well, at least the fire, water, and earthbending does. The music is pretty good as well, glad to see they kept a similar vibe. Ok now for the negatives.Ok, here's what they did wrong. First off, the writing is awful. I don't know how any of this got past a writers' room. I watched the show with my sister, an English major, and she couldn't stop mentioning how bad the writing was, and quite honestly, I agree with her. Secondly, The changes they made weren't just different, they were just bad. They tried making the show way too serious, they isn't any humor at all, and their attempts at comedy are just cringey. They made changes that just didn't fit the characters and really messed with the story. They also give you WAY too much information on the lore in the first episode. They \"manslplain\" everything to you and it just comes off as cringey. Third, there's too much Hollywood influence. Avatar is supposed to stand out and be different from most media, and that's one of the things they kind of failed to deliver in this show. Every episode feels like they're just trying to hype up some big money shot, and doing so they fail to have good character interactions or filler moments. Fourth, the airbending looks awful. They broke so many of their own rules with airbending, it just looks like Aang is literelly flying, especially in the first episode. And if you've seen Avatar and Korra, you'd know that we never see an Airbender fly until The Legend of Korra. The way they introduced Aang and airbending just made him look like Peter Pan, and it was just awful.I could go on about all this for hours, but instead I'll leave you with this. If you're going to watch this show, watch the cartoon first if you haven't already. The more I suffered through this show just made me miss the original more and more. This just proves that Avatar is meant to be an animated series, not live action. Not everything needs a live action rendition to be good. I'm sick and tired of movie companies just rereleasing content as live action, it's repetitive, annoying, unoriginal, and usually worse than the original anyways, I would hate for this show to be anyone's first experience with Avatar the Last Airbender.","rating":"4\/10","date":"6 March 2024"}
{"title":"Why? Just why?","review":"I rarely write reviews, but this... it's just sad.I'll start by saying I kind of liked the more serious tone. The actors did a great job, and I think the casting was spot-on.But the characters? What happened? Where's the character development?I understand that in adapting a story for a different medium, there have to be some changes or some parts of the story have to be cut.For example, Jet and his freedom fighters being in Omashu. I get it. It does change Katara's definition of \"innocent people\". Here, these innocents are sort of her allies instead of civilians of the enemy nation, but I get it. But it could easily be cut off with the Mechanist part. It did not serve the story.Why do these showrunners always try to adapt these stories by changing the source material? They are changing the very thing that made them a success. So... why?There's a reason why The Last Of Us was so successful. With One Piece - which I think was true to its source and preserved the very core of what made it One Piece - and The Last Of Us, I thought they finally came to their senses and understood that they just need to remain true to the source they are adapting, and the show will most likely be a success. But no...I mean, the way they showed why Sokka trained with Suki has no meaning now in him overcoming his perception of who or what a warrior is. This was the moment that he does not let his ego define him.And the moment that broke me: Bumi's trials. Why, just why?Instead of a mad genius, we get what? A short-sighted - somewhat mad - sad old man? Bumi was playing the long game. He helped Aang adapt to any situation and to think not just as an airbender. Yet here, he wants to die? So he can teach Aang a lesson? Just... What?What I'm most sad about is that Aang does not have a sense of adventure in this adaptation. He was, despite being surrounded by looming doom, a goofy kid who brought hope to people in a time of war.I could go on, but let's stop here. This is already more of a rant than a review. It's just frustrating when the original had great messages and, if I can be so bold, life lessons told through episodes and arcs - no matter who watched it, a child or a grown-up, you cared for those characters.","rating":"3\/10","date":"25 February 2024"}
{"title":"Compared to the heartful series....","review":"I will admit, it has been an interesting exploration of different perspective of this series. It isn't the same at all, a blend of many episodes from the original animation into shorter episodes in retrospect. My big problem, biggest problem... is the emotional delivery of lines, or even the lines themselves. The animated series really emphasized the voice acting, the emphasis of lines, of dialogue, of personality... it isn't here. In fact, the lines seemed rushed in delivery, as is the emotion. The emotion of the characters even seem awkward, or shortly cut, rushed.... it really makes me appreciate the memory of the animated series delivery of their voice lines. I am on episode 5, and will indeed finish this series out of pure curiosity of what they will provide as a \"finished season\". I definitely look forward to rewatching the original animated series and reliving what it was, after just a few episodes of this one.... but am amused by this series, in that it is an attempt to somehow recreate the spirit of the original. Though, ultimately I don't think it's quite cut it. Still, I hope they will do another season, just to explore more of what they think will lay a mark. I am not expecting to be satisfied, but look forward to their efforts. Still, I am not completely pleased with the directing of the expression of each character, as the voice acting of the animated series was just much more expressive of the personalities of these characters. Still, this has amused me just a bit.... even though I completely understand why the original creators left this project. I see this as a \"re-envisioning\", not at all perfect.","rating":"5\/10","date":"23 February 2024"}
{"title":"Missed Opportunity.","review":"## The Live-Action Avatar: A Missed Opportunity?The live-action adaptation of \"Avatar: The Last Airbender\" arrived with a heavy burden of expectation. While the ambition to translate the beloved animated series into a live-action format is commendable, the execution leaves me with a sense of disappointment. Ultimately, the live-action adaptation feels like a **missed opportunity**, failing to capitalize on its potential and offering little that wasn't already done, and arguably better, in the original.**Catering to a Grown Audience:**One of the most significant missed opportunities lies in the target audience. The original series, while cherished by viewers of all ages, undeniably skewed younger. The live-action adaptation had the chance to **reimagine the story for a more mature audience**, mirroring the growth of the original fanbase. This could have involved raising the age rating to explore **darker thematic elements** already present in the story. The animated series masterfully tackled themes of war, loss, and the psychological impact of violence on individuals and societies. A live-action adaptation had the potential to delve deeper into these themes, creating a richer and more nuanced viewing experience.**Falling Short of the Source Material:**Unfortunately, the live-action adaptation often feels like a **pale imitation** of the original series. Instead of building upon the strong foundation of the animated version, the live-action struggles to capture its essence.For example, the **pacing** feels rushed, particularly in the first few episodes, cramming crucial plot points and character introductions into a short timeframe. This results in a **lack of emotional depth**. We see the characters go through the motions, but we don't fully connect with their struggles or triumphs.Furthermore, the **dialogue** often feels bland and generic, failing to capture the wit and charm that made the original characters so endearing.It's important to note that not all aspects of the live-action are without merit. The **visual effects** are impressive, particularly in depicting bending abilities. Additionally, some acting performances, like that of Katara, offer glimmers of potential.**A Cautious Hope for the Future:**Despite the current shortcomings, a sliver of **hope remains** for future seasons. The series still has the potential to course-correct and address the issues raised by critics and fans alike.To achieve this, the creators need to **acknowledge the feedback** and make significant changes. This could involve raising the age rating, allowing for a deeper exploration of mature themes, and investing more time in character development and world-building.Ultimately, the success of the live-action \"Avatar: The Last Airbender\" hinges on its ability to **learn from its mistakes** and deliver a compelling adaptation that honors the legacy of the original series while offering a fresh perspective for a new generation of viewers.**Personal Connection:**As a child, I found immense joy and inspiration in the animated series. It captivated me with its engaging story, relatable characters, and timeless message of hope and resilience. The live-action adaptation, while visually impressive in some aspects, failed to recapture the magic of the original and left me yearning for the depth and emotional resonance that defined the animated series.","rating":"5\/10","date":"26 February 2024"}
{"title":"You ruined a master piece, again..","review":"Netflix consistently does the same thing, they assume their audience is stupid af, and explain everything in terribly mundane dialogue. Take out all the rough edges to ensure no one vocal gets insulted, thereby taking away all potential for character building.It's hard to feel anything when they fail at making you feel something for the characters. Live or die, none of these characters mean anything, not even to each other.50% was good casting, other 50% terrible. I mean how can you fail at capturing the essence of a character so miserably? The one time they didn't actually have to apply quota casting, they still fail so hard. And why the pointless story changes? Roku was one of the most amazing mentor figures and absolutely essential to Aang's development. But a wise old male does not fit the new narrative apparently. Completely missing the point that he is a wise and great mentor because he made such horrible mistakes himself.This should either have been darker or lighter, make up your mind. The main thing you can bring forward in a live action movie is the darker parts, which they tried but then wrapped in some comical dialogue at completely the wrong moments.What made atla so good, is the character development. It actually deals with very dark and difficult themes, but with a brush of light joyous childhood coming of age approach.Please people of Netflix, will you finally understand, if you have to explain art and spell it out for everyone, then it's not art at all. Great cinema is about touching the emotional strings of the audience, well you touched mine in all the wrong ways. Similar as if you had finger painted over the sixteenth Chapel, you ruined a master piece. Again.","rating":"3\/10","date":"25 February 2024"}
{"title":"It is boring","review":"Another bad adaptation from Netflix and this time Avatar is the victim. Very mediocre show and the fact that they took out the humor plays a very important role here. The main characters have no soul. Even Aang who is the funniest character in the original, here is like a robot. In general the acting of the main characters except for Zuko is very mediocre, let's not lie... I personally found Aang annoying several times and what's going on with Katara? Only in the last episode she showed some emotion in her eyes, all season it was like she was smoking some kind of weed lol... The direction is pretty good with some great fights but the script has a serious issue...Just so you understand, here the characters are just uninteresting. You don't have the suspense you had in the original. You finish it and you're like hey ok whatever. If you're a fanatic about the world of Avatar then you should probably stop at the second episode where Kyoshi appears and which in my opinion is the best episode of the series.Also, when you hear that the creators of the original project don't agree or leave then bells must be ringing...","rating":"5\/10","date":"24 March 2024"}

{"title":"Lost in the Elements: When Avatar's Live-Action Adaptations Couldn't Bend the Story Right.","review":"The new Avatar: The Last Airbender live-action series, despite initial promising aspects showcased in its trailer and characterizations, ultimately fell short of expectations, echoing the disappointments of M. Night Shyamalan's movie adaptation. While the visual effects in the series may have been superior to those in Shyamalan's film, they couldn't compensate for the lack of depth in storytelling.One of the most glaring flaws of both adaptations is the absence of the humor that was a hallmark of the original animated series. The witty banter and comedic timing that endeared fans to the characters were noticeably absent, stripping away a crucial element of the show's charm.Moreover, both adaptations suffered from rushed pacing, sacrificing essential character development and narrative depth in favor of advancing the storyline hastily. This resulted in a lack of emotional resonance and investment in the characters and their journey, leaving viewers feeling disconnected from the narrative.Ultimately, despite the advancements in visual effects, the new live-action series failed to capture the essence and spirit of the original animated series. Instead, it served as another reminder of the challenges inherent in translating a beloved animated show to live-action without losing what made it special in the first place.","rating":"3\/10","date":"23 February 2024"}

Despite this, the production excelled in technical aspects such as costumes and scenography. The special effects for air\/water\/earth\/fire-bending lacked some artistic vision, often appearing too literal and occasionally cheap.

They completely destroyed Sokka's character arc by deleting his initial sexism and his learning from it. He didn't even have to dress up as a Kiyoshi warrior either, which I thought was a shame. Katara's character was completely messed up, she didn't even resemble the source material. Not a looks comparison, a personality and character arc comparison.The acting in this show was...not good. I don't even know if it was the actors' fault. The dialogue was on the nose and expository, super unnatural. I found myself rolling my eyes and laughing at it throughout.

{"title":"Barely Better than Shyamalan's Disaster","review":"This show fundamentally misunderstands the original story and its characters. Its poorly acted, poorly directed, with bad production design and the worst dialogue I think I've ever heard in a show THIS expensive and highly anticipated.I was fairly optimistic and hopeful before it's release. Many people had already written it off well before it's release but I was one of the few who kept an open mind despite the numerous warning signs.This show handles adapting the source material about as poorly as it could have. It rearranges events in ways that lessen the emotional impact of each event changed. It subtly changes character motivations in ways that rob the characters of their flaws and their personal trials. It, ironically, dumbs down source material made for children and ruins the pacing of a perfectly paced masterpiece.I was open to changes, I just happen to think every change they made was a significant misfire that only served to ruin the experience and lessen the impact of the story.Aang was a terrible actor, Katara was made bland and performed poorly, Gran Gran was UNBELIEVABLY terrible, the Fire Lord was made far less menacing by showing his face and by having Zuko ruin his powerful menace by \"defeating\" him in combat as a little child.They crammed several storylines into one episode sometimes (including episodes from later seasons) and then artificially extends other episodes in ways that feel like a waste of time.I hate what they did with Bumi's character. Hate how they introduced Azula, Mai, and Tai Lee so unceremoniously.I hate how the whole show takes place is hideous digital environments that feel flat and artificial.I hate just about everything it did. And it wasn't even well shot. The only thing I can say in praise is that the VFX weren't terrible for the bending and Sokka was a good casting choice.","rating":"3\/10","date":"12 April 2024"}
{"title":"Leagues better than the movie, but still falls short.","review":"I really wanted to like this series. I love ATLA, it's one of my faovurite aniamted series ever. I really enjoyed the bending in the show, it's better than the movie could ever hope for. The bending was actually my favorite part of the entire series. However, Netflix worked its magic and fell short of what could have been an amazing story. Adapting any animation into live-action isn't an easy task, you can do things with animation that you can't in live-action. However, that doesn't mean the studio has to take the liberties it believes it should and fail to flesh out the main character properly. What made the animated ATLA special was how even the side characters were amazing, their backstories and growth made you love them. For whatever reason, the studio for this live-action decided they didn't want to spend as much time on those details.I know what some people are going to say: \"Well, there are 20 episodes in the animated and only 8 here, you can't possibly fit all the same details\" Alright, but the pilot episode for the live-action series was an hour long, and.consequent episodes were on average 40 minutes long, or double the length of the animated series. Doing some very general math, 20*20 minutes = 400 minutes. 60 + (7*40) = 340 minutes. That's a 60 minute difference. You can choose to omit details so that the storytelling isn't drastically different, but the way they decided to completely leave out some of Aang's story (I won't spoil it here, I believe you should decide for yourself), is criminal.Leaving out details to adjust for a shorter runtime is fine, but cutting out important details and interactions is not.

However, the casting team is really bad especially the AVATAR TEAM. Sorry to say, can't feel any of them having true feeling or emotion for their own role.KATARA and ANG both really needs to improve their acting skills, they are the worst in the whole casting team. 80% of the movie they are just like reading the script. The most obvious thing is the expression on their face is really too naive and lack of experience.Secondly, the storyline is WAY TOO DRAGGY from episode 1 to episode 7, the last episode too rush to conclude everything and storyline is unclear AT ALL!I have never watch the cartoon before so I'm not sure how is the real story is, but this show portrait ANG as a very useless character. Among all of those kids, ZUKO is doing really great, jiayou!Anyway, as a movie to past your time is not a bad choice, but do we enjoying it, uhuh, the effect is.","rating":"2\/10","date":"1 March 2024"}
{"title":"If you like the original series, you'll hate this...","review":"The CGI and post production was brilliant, the focus on the other previous avatars and not just Roku was a nice touch.However, the storyline was butchered and pieced together in ways that didn't make sense. There were characters in places they shouldn't have been. Aang spent the whole thing moping around and his happy go lucky, childish nature was completely lost. The individual nations bending styles were weak, eg. The air nomads bent like earthbenders. Zukos burnt eye should have been done with prosthetics and not just a bit of facepaint.Overall; weak script, poor characterisation and came across like they didn't even watch or care about the original series.","rating":"2\/10","date":"24 February 2024"}
{"title":"Not worth exploring","review":"I forced myself to finish watching this, although it did have some redeeming qualities and moments, I just couldn't get past the game graphic backgrounds and the horizontal 2D feeling of the cinematography. Not all parts were like this, it was only the CGI backgrounded scenes. The story beats felt too fast paced and nothing felt like it had order or enough time to settle. The characters didn't feel like friends to me, they just felt like co-stars. The chemistry just wasn't there. Sokka, Zuko, Uncle Iroh and Momo were the only believable characters, who also felt closer to how they felt in the show.","rating":"5\/10","date":"26 February 2024"}
{"title":"Removed Character Development","review":"The visuals may be good, but it fails to make up for the vast swathe of cut content crucial to the development and growth of the characters. With Sokka's sexism removed, he never learns from his experience with the Kyoshi warriors that women can be warriors too, which removes the need for them to be in the show at all. With Aang's little side trip's he uses to try and avoid his responsibilities as the Avatar removed, he never meets King Bumi in Omashu. Without the Dai Li's conspiracy in Ba Sing Se, The Tales of Ba Sing Se never occur; Iroh never mourns his son's death. Toph and Katara don't bond together. Zuko never learns how to be happy again by going on a date with the girl he met at the tea shop he opened with his uncle. Part of the search for Appa is removed completely. Without Katara's role as the mother figure of the group, it severely hurts her dynamic in Team Avatar. After all, Katara is the only mother Sokka ever had. Aang is an orphan, and needs someone to be a mother figure. These parts of the story are crucial to the development of the characters, and without them, the show's story suffers irreparably.","rating":"1\/10","date":"25 February 2024"}
{"title":"Special effects were fantastic, acting and dialog were absolutely cringe","review":"Some scenes out of context were incredible. The production value was really high and it showed. The dialog however was literally written by chat gpt, and the acting was so poor at times I feel the show could have 10x'd by just simply having no one speak. Sadly, just cause someone lands a part in a show does not mean they're going to be great at acting. I had no issues at all with the story changes, it is an adaptation after all.If you love exceptionally exposition heavy dialog, with every plot point and nuance spelled out for you by a chatbot, you'll love this. That said, still a monster improvement on the first live action movie.","rating":"2\/10","date":"28 February 2024"}

The original film kept us wanting more' I really badly wanted to see him learn the water, earth, and fire bending. But no you just had to tell tne exact same story as the original film! And yet again you have us waiting again! Will there be a season 2? Will there ever be a point in my life where they finally finish the story? I don't know but all this did was leave me wanting to see more again! Perhaps that's the point but for god sakes man!

The characters were disappointing as well they looked nothing like the original characters. The whole show almost looks like it was AI generated. This was the only show I was keeping Netflix for but I canceled almost immediately after watching the show. The show was just so cringeworthy that at times I would have to walk away. The original writers definitely did a good job of leaving this show. I am just extremely disappointed because I was really looking forward to this show.","rating":"2\/10","date":"25 February 2024"}

This is a soulless series that completely missed the mark for anyone who watched the OG. The filming is done well hence the rating I gave, however the storyline left me sad. So much more could have been done had they used the correct writers and actors. Something missed the mark between the two. We all know what Avatar is supposed to be, but they just did not follow what worked and attempted to try something new. Maybe the new generation that doesn't know will enjoy it. Possibly next time they'll get it correct.","rating":"3\/10","date":"24 February 2024"}

{"title":"Cringy kids show","review":"Yeah, ATLA was a cartoon for kids 20 years ago, no problem with that at all.But those kids all grew up and now the fanbase for this show is 30+ years old. They don't want to see a goofy and cringy kids show where blades draw no blood and whole battles are fought without a single person dying. Nobody wants to watch a show in which war has no death and gore.I'm giving 2 stars because it is visually stunning, no denying that. But that's it. It's a visually stunning goofy kids show that will have you cringing every 30 seconds.I'm gonna be completely honest here: the movie was better. That one deserves at least 3 stars.","rating":"2\/10","date":"22 February 2024"}
{"title":"Why fix what's not broken","review":"1. Some\/maybe most animated media doesn't need to be redone or remade into a live action\n2. If animated media IS going to be turned into live action worry more about the story then the effects (since that's what CAN be translated more)\n3. If the original creators leave (especially for creative differences), that should be a signal that the direction the project is going in isn't good\n4. Overall this Netflix rendition of the Avatar the Last Airbender series is a fail - all fluff and effects and no substance, heart, merit or longevity - this reflects poorly on the writers, director, decision makers who thought this media was needed.","rating":"1\/10","date":"8 March 2024"}
{"title":"From Original Excellence to Shallow Echoes","review":"The animated series stands as a hallmark of storytelling, rich in character development and thematic depth, which the Netflix rendition unfortunately fails to capture. The latter introduces a darker tone, seemingly in pursuit of maturity, but it comes across as forced and superficial, overshadowing the nuanced exploration of themes that fans cherished in the original. This new series is marred by an overreliance on exposition, lacking the emotional resonance and logical progression that made the original characters relatable and their journeys compelling.In contrast to the dynamic character development and team cohesion found in the original Avatar, the Netflix series presents isolated narratives and shallow character connections. Key moments that should establish bonds and motivations, such as Katara and Sokka's decision to join Aang, are handled with a lack of depth and explanation, undermining the story's coherence and emotional impact. This approach extends to the broader narrative structure, where the rich, interconnected storytelling of the original is replaced with disjointed and unengaging plot points.Moreover, the adaptation's attempt to compress and alter significant portions of the original storyline results in a disjointed narrative that lacks the original's charm and coherence. The performances vary, with some actors striving to honor their characters despite the limitations of the script and direction, while others falter, further detracting from the series' appeal. While the visual effects and casting show promise, they are not enough to compensate for the fundamental issues with pacing, character development, and storytelling.For newcomers to the Avatar universe, the Netflix series might offer a passable entertainment experience, meriting a modest rating for its visuals and effort. However, for those seeking a series with the depth, emotion, and quality of the original animated Avatar, this adaptation falls significantly short. In its attempt to reimagine a beloved story, it unfortunately delivers a diluted experience, earning a rating of 3.5\/10 primarily for its visual achievements and the ambition to bring a cherished tale to a new audience.","rating":"3\/10","date":"24 February 2024"}
{"title":"Barely better than Shyamalan's","review":"CGI is terrible and worse than that it's overused.Dialogue is incredibly clunky and cringeworthy.Acting is subpar but I don't think it's the actors fault but just a general lack of direction and setup.The cast seem to look like the character which is nice (besides Iroh and Zhao) whose acting and lines are even worse.Bending is not impressive at all and very slow and does not even seem dangerous.Crucial parts to the plot are given away immediately and key characters and moments are completely removed without explanation or a suitable replacement.Very disappointing and hope future seasons will rectify these issues.","rating":"2\/10","date":"27 February 2024"}
{"title":"An insulting adaptation of the graphic novel and show","review":"So many things were wrong with this show but the CGI was good.The casting, storyboarding, & acting were all wrong. They're compressed the story arcs and personality development arcs to comply with an 8 episode show and as a result, they have ruined the show. It's really sad to see that Aang didn't even firebend or earth bend and still somehow ends up facing his ultimate opponent - the Firelord.The casting of Azula & her two friends was absolutely horrid. The jokes are missing and the actors lack the zest which was an important part of the tale of how Aang & his friends mature over time and finally learn what is important and gather the skills to set the balance of the world right. This is, definitely a badly made show.","rating":"4\/10","date":"29 February 2024"}
{"title":"Better than the 2010 movie","review":"I haven't watched the cartoon, etc., so the movie I saw in 2010 was just completely horrible, senseless, and overall just too bad.Now, onto the series - I had no idea what to expect. Well, it was way better than the aforementioned movie, but I was still expecting Avatar to have it all, mastering all forms. Maybe another season or two, or perhaps just one more for that.I don't understand why producers and creators don't aim to complete a series in one go. Why do they have to drag them out? It often results in a few good scenes with one or two excellent episodes, while the others are typically boring, long conversations and just being stretched.The same story applies here. Although every episode provides good fighting scenes and displays of power, there's also a lot of unnecessary chatter, twisting, and drama, which, for me, was the boring element.Given the limited options on screen these days, it's still a good series to watch.P. S.Gordon Cormier, superb acting on his part.","rating":"5\/10","date":"25 February 2024"}
{"title":"Couldn't get through the first episode","review":"This makes all the mistakes the horrible film adaptation did. The writing leaves nothing to the imagination and they overstate EVERYTHING, and I mean everything. There are scenes that have exposition just for the sake of having exposition and then some scenes where I was looking forward to characters interacting that was cut short for some reason.I will say the visuals are absolutely stunning, but none of us fell in love with the original animated series because it was beautiful to look at. I fell in love with the characters, the dialogue, and the development of these characters. This show jumps into the action without giving you a chance to be endeared to the characters.Also, I'm sure the child actors are great people, but the acting is horrendous. The actors for Aang, Katarra, and Zuko especially are just bad at acting. There just is no on-screen charisma and seems like the actors are reading from a script in every scene. It takes you out of every scene and maybe if they had somewhat decent lines the acting would be better, but both the writing and acting are bad.It's obvious why the original creators left, if I saw the script and was on set for this I wouldn't want my name attached to this project either.The last thing was the music felt very lacking and there were whole scenes with no soundtrack or background music and it took me out of so many scenes.","rating":"2\/10","date":"23 February 2024"}
{"title":"Decent","review":"I guess I'll put my 2 cents in, since reviewing movies and tv shows is what i wanna do. Let me start by saying that avatar the last Airbender is my favorite animated show of all time (and trust me, that's no small thing). And like all if you, u absolutely despised the movie that shall not be named. So going into netflixa adaptation, i was, shall we say , cautiously optimistic. So how do i feel about it? Its........complicated. The bending is awesome, choreographed very well and exciting to watch. The effects are sometimes good, sometimes a little rubbery, but nothing to distracting. The story, while rushed, does a decent job making sure to include the important characters and situations, even if they've been altered slightly, and cutting out a lot of filler (not that i minded the filler) although some things were definitely missed. It doesn't follow the animation to a t, nut i don't think it's trying to. I believe it's trying to be it's own interpretation. Also, the giant water fish battle was awesome. But, there are some negatives. Some of the acting is just bad. The kid playing aang just annoyed me and a lot of the line delivery fell flat. I also got tired of the constant pitty partying. The character development, if you can call it that, also felt kinda generic (which is a shame because ATLA had some ofnthr best character development I've ever seen in anything). I still enjoyed it and felt genuine emotion while watching it, and will be tuning into book 2, but it's far from reaching the hights of it's superior. In the end, to quote Ivan moody(five finger death punch) \"it could've been much worse but it should've been better\"","rating":"5\/10","date":"23 February 2024"}
{"title":"More than a disaster, but less than a meh","review":"I am all about creative liberties when it comes to live action remakes. I don't want a shot-by-shot remake of the show, but the writers failed this show. The pacing was rushed, the dialogue was mostly exposition. Characters constantly told you how they felt or what they were doing instead of the director letting the actors portray emotions. To me, it felt like the writers had AI do the research and then filled in the gaps with wiki. Overall, adaptation wise, it felt like I was watching a recap of ATLA but done in the style of a high school play. By the first episode, I completely understood why the creators left the project.My three biggest issues are:1) it does a whole lot of telling and not showing which is already the biggest rule breaker in any form of media. Because of this, it made watching it a boring chore.2) They fast tracked through some pivotal moments that could have been perfect for understanding more lore + the characters. All of it was just infodumped on the audience.3) Zuko and Aang. Zuko was not angry enough for me. He did not feel like he actually felt wronged by his father, and not only that, he did not have the anger backing up why he was searching for the avatar in the first place. It was a shame because Zuko's character arc is the most well thought out, heart wrenching arc in the series, and the live action did nothing to give him the justice. Aang also was toned down because we didn't see him playing or cutting up or just being a kid which is what his entire personality + personal goal is in life. He doesn't want to be the avatar, he wants to be a kid first. They adult-ified Aang to the point where he felt like a completely different character who had the liberty of having the same name.As for the good, I have little to say other than during some points, it did seem like they were trying. For me, it feels like the reason why it came so rushed and exposition-y was on the behalf of studio interference. Netflix had the One Piece LA down to a clutch, so I don't know how they managed to to mess the ATLA LA up so bad if it wasn't because of said studio interference. I also did enjoy the fight scenes. Yeah the bending effects were goofy, but they sort of had a charm to them. I also enjoyed that Appa didn't look like they tried to make him too realistic, and he still had a cartoonish vibe to him. The actor who played Sokka really carried the trio, but again, I think its because direction did not allow the Katara to act motherly and for Aang to act like a child. I have no idea why they took these traits away from them because it make them stiff planks of wood, but Sokka was at least a reprieve from how boring those two were.Overall, I went in disappointed by all the news I heard around the show prior to its release, and somehow I left even more disappointed.","rating":"4\/10","date":"25 February 2024"}
{"title":"It confused me.","review":"So, i grew up watching the original over and over. This show has a special spot in my heart and honestly visually im not super dissapointed. Certain scenes were done better then others but i never hated it.But, the price of everything looking good probably made them cut corners.Man did i wanna see the room filled with avatar statues, or aang never learning to bend a droplett of water. Which is a great segway into my next problem. They trow the word balance around but it has completely lost it's meaning, they somehow changed the show to have a darker undertone but friendship is the new focus. I think the original had such a great story and such a great message that adding the friendship\/teamwork stuff is there for no reason ( This was already a part of the original)? Do they just want to fill time with conversation so they have to make less scenes with visual effects? I hope they don't make choices this way but idk why else they added that. I honestly have more problems with a lot\nlike, scenes being inspired by other movies and not the source (godzilla screech in finale), characters show up with their arc being cut or simplefied. Especially when they then decide to trow in characters who normally show up season later.I quickly want to add that a show like avatar deserved\/needed more then 8 episodes. It felt rushed and the choises that were made dont feel like they were done to enhance the story. And honestly if were not enhancing the story and making a downgraded version of an original why even make it. This is probably the last adaptation we are getting so hopefully they accept their mistakes and fix some things for a second season. I could keep writing i know i was harsh and i honestly didnt hate the show but being inspired by Avatar: the last airbender they just had such potential. They should have kept working with the original producers and just listened to them lets hope they get them back for s2.

{"title":"Pleasant Enough, But Very, Very, Very Bland.","review":"A good enough plot (a little different than the book) and some excellent visuals, but that is not enough to not deliver good storytelling by itself.The most obvious limitation of any screenplay, whether for movies, tv or streaming, is to have a well-written script, and in this respect, the script fails. If I were to close my eyes, and imagine what year\/age\/dimension\/universe this was written in, I would say 21st century America, so mediocre is the writing. It almost appears that the demographic is 15 years old, with a 5th grade reading level. It is disappointing when a fantasy story does not move the viewer to another time and place (a la Lord of The Rings). Netflix seems determined to \"dumb down\" its writing for the least sophisticated audience it can attract. I can almost hear them telling the writers \"Don't make the audience have to think at all.\" In this they succeeded.And, compounding the writing is a cast that, while likeable enough, cannot act their way out of the proverbial \"paper bag.\" No nuance in the acting for anyone except Iroh, Appa and Gyotsa. Commander Zhao is a one-note actor in this series. Sokka, Zuko, Azula and Katara may eventually hone their craft, but, in this, they appear to be reading their lines as though it was a rehearsal. No facial expressions of any depth cross their faces at any point.I'm hoping there'll be another season where the writing and acting are better, but for now, it's kiddie fare.Now, my husband likes it and he's a college professor, so don't go by me.

In most parts of this series, there is a contradiction, which is painful for the careful and well-informed viewer.This series looks like it was written by a kid, as the crew's mind seems to be more plot driven than reality!.It's no surprise that the original creators have abandoned the project as this new director has no creativity, talent or loyalty to the original series. It's not bad to change things, but if it's to the detriment of the plot, characters, or world of the show, leave it to someone else.In the hope of progress and honoring the field of deep and valuable films and series.

It genuinely had me groaning and rolling my eyes and facepalming the whole time, and I barely made it through the episodes. The writing is terrible. Exposition dumps everywhere and characters knowing more than they should. The dialogue is laughably bad, the characters say so little by speaking so much, even going into half-monologues. The delivery is often clunky and awkward, emotional moments are often devoid of emotions etc. The only saving grace it has is previously knowing the overarching main plot of the original series. I would have given it zero stars if I could if it wasn't an adaptation (but an original) or if I had seen this without previously having seen the original series.","rating":"3\/10","date":"25 February 2024"}
{"title":"They should have never made this (Visual effects look dope though)","review":"The original animated series was known for its in-depth character development, with each member of Team Avatar and even secondary characters like Zuko and Iroh given extensive backstories and growth. The time and space the animated series had to unfold these stories are difficult to fully replicate in a live-action format, which is limited by the number of episodes and the length of each episode. The creators knew this and therefore they should have never even tried to recreate it.The original series featured a rich interweaving of cultural and philosophical themes, inspired by East Asian, Inuit, and South Asian cultures, as well as Taoist, Buddhist, and Hindu philosophies. These aspects weren't fully explored or conveyed in the Netflix adaptation.The animated series had a unique ability to tackle complex themes such as war, peace, forgiveness, and self-discovery in a subtle way that appealed to both children and adults. This subtlety was lost in the live-action, where the emphasis was more on visual effects and action than on the deeper messages. (Visual effects were great though)Another defining element of the original series was the balance between serious themes and light-hearted humor. Characters like Sokka provided comic relief that blended well with the more serious moments. In live action this ratio was much less balanced, this series seemed too serious.","rating":"1\/10","date":"29 February 2024"}

They are flying on the bison over the arctic ocean, snow is flying around, and yet, no one of the characters wears a hat. My boy, the Avatar with his shaved head should probably catch meningitis and even worse, considering his still wearing his thin garments. Oh, the powah of the Avatar must protect them all. This might have worked for the animated series, it was for kids anyway. So Im wondering who was this made for? The goofiness of the animation is gone. Jokes barely exist. I like how Aang looks, he was cast good, but I blame the director for not making him shine. Zuko is the only one that plays his part good enough, and I could not wait to see him back on screen.

Aang teams up with people of the other elements to fight fire with earth, wind, and water.The season ends leaving you hanging. I wish I had the commission of selling this film green screen. The two lead male actors were bad. Gordon Cormier is worse than Daniel Radcliffe in his first Harry Potter film. Maybe they had trouble finding kids willing to shave their head and get a \"one way\" arrow painted on their head. Ian Ousley had a poorly scripted part which he could not save.

Where are the pirates? That's like 4+ episodes of character development and returning characters that just aren't going to happen now.Also, Avatar Kyoshi telling Aang to go to the North Pole? And changing his body when he channels her? Talking to her first instead of Roku? Just what...completely needless changes.TEO WASN'T IN OMASHU.Where's the humor? The joy?

{"title":"Mediocre at best, what a waste","review":"The writing is bad. So bad, one might think they used an AI to generate it.They are mixing up events and story lines without care for the impact it has on the overall story arc. I understand the need to reduce the number of locations for a live action adaptation, to prevent the budget from exploding, but this has to be done with care and thought. Sadly that care and thought seems to be completely missing.Another major problem is the friendship between Katara and Aang or rather the lack of it in this version. There is almost no interaction and dialogue between the two. They either completely removed every special moment the two shared in the anime or they stupidly changed them. In one instance they made one of these moments a Soka-Katara moment with Aang nowhere to be seen. \"The Cave of Two Lovers\" certainly gets a whole new ring to it, when it is about brother and sister.","rating":"5\/10","date":"25 February 2024"}

Not worth watching if you're a fan of the original, and not worth watching if you're not, just go watch the cartoon instead either way, every single aspect of this series is done better in the original cartoon, so why does this exist?

{"title":"Different from original and lacking character development","review":"I was looking forward to watching the live-action adaptation of my favorite animated series, but unfortunately, the show didn't quite meet my expectations. While there were some good elements like the visuals and additional scenes that added depth to the supporting characters, the show's rushed storyline and some changes in the plot made it difficult to fully appreciate. Some of the key moments were either rewritten with other characters or removed altogether, which was disappointing. Additionally, some scenes lacked the humor that the original series had, making them feel dull. Additionally, while some of the cast did a great job in portraying their characters, others didn't quite fit the bill. Despite these shortcomings, I don't think the show was bad - it just didn't live up to the original storyline. I believe that with some tweaks in the pacing and attention to detail, the show could have been much better. Overall, I think the show has potential, but it was disappointing when compared to the original storyline.","rating":"5\/10","date":"26 February 2024"}
{"title":"A Visually Stunning Yet Emotionally Flat Adaptation","review":"So, while \"The Last Airbender\" looks great with all its cool effects and scenery, it's a letdown when it comes to the stuff that really matters - making us care about the characters just like we did in the cartoon.In the ambitious leap from animation to live-action, \"The Last Airbender\" serves as a visual feast that stunningly captures the essence of bending, the power it wields, and the fantastical geography that fans have come to love. The effects are nothing short of remarkable, offering a tangible representation of the animated series' most iconic elements.However, this adaptation finds itself caught in a whirlwind of disappointment when it comes to its core-character portrayal. Despite the visual splendor, the series struggles profoundly in capturing the nuanced personalities that made the original series so compelling. The performances, unfortunately, lack depth and fail to convey the complex emotions and development the characters.","rating":"4\/10","date":"24 February 2024"}
{"title":"Bland and the writing is pretty despicable","review":"If it wasn't for it being the Avatar I would have stopped watching it after episode 1. I have to put in effort to keep watching. It's just boring and empty.Other than Zuko pretty much everyone falls flat with their acting.The worst part of this show by far is the writing. They put so much money into the stunning visuals that they forgot what makes a show good. It all comes back to the writing.Cut back on the beautiful visuals and put a lot of money into the writing, this will help disguise the poor acting as well and can make the show good. The elements for a good show are there.I am more than happy for the show not to follow exactly from the original, but please make the dialogue natural. Right now everyone speaks like they are on stage in a play. Stop with the telling and start showing (writing 101), some of the actors should really be replaced. But at the very least get in some great writers.","rating":"5\/10","date":"25 February 2024"}
{"title":"Disappointing","review":"Visually Netflix hit in pretty much everything for the show. Costumes, scenery and the creatures in the show. I have no complaints in that department. What made this remake so disappointing was the writing. I understand making minor changes here and there because it was only slated for 8 episodes. Changes made to characters, show concepts and events were awful. I felt they took away certain character arcs which caused certain events to change and those decisions were unnecessary. Filling in gaps from the original cartoon are fine but changing fundamental things from the original cartoon just don't make sense. The point of doing a live action remake is to bring animation to life while still enjoying what we loved about the characters and story. There are good things that this show displays and I hope for future seasons they can build on those things while improving upon the obvious mistakes they made in this first season. The ceiling for this show is high but the writers have a long way to go before they can reach that.","rating":"5\/10","date":"25 February 2024"}
{"title":"Thank God for the forward button - snoozefest","review":"I was really hoping this was going to be a serious series but I was so wrong. I only kept watching because I could fast forward the when I wanted to and boy did I do that alooooot. There were more talking than action and the little action scenes were laughable. I guess that's because this is the first season, so they wanted to paint a backdrop for each character. But my gosh, it's so boring for us who already knows them or don't care.I must say the Fx were better than expected. And the costumes were great but that's just about the only thing. The acting was subpar. And the Avatar kid sucked the most. Kyoshi was a better Avatar when she showed up, it was amazing. Maybe am just too old for their target audience ie. Kids.Come to think of this, there was not one single black representation. WOW! I understand it's an adaptation from an existing story but based on comments, this isn't exactly a word for word adaptation so I don't think adding some black characters in there would have be an abomination.Such a huge disappointment.","rating":"3\/10","date":"24 February 2024"}
{"title":"A Miss","review":"There's only one reason why someone would even attempt to remake the perfection that is the animated show: hubris. This show never stood a chance of living up to the source material, but I was hopeful for a slightly better end product than this. I'm giving it a 3 for a few good moments, good music, and decent costume design, but that's all there is to this show. It's just hours of unnecessary expositions instead of telling a good story. There was no reason to try and recreate the original show, why can't we just leave things be and simply enjoy them for what they are? Why does Hollywood insist on remaking everything we hold dear? Icarus flew too close to the sun on this one.","rating":"3\/10","date":"5 March 2024"}
{"title":"It's not as bad as the movie version...","review":"Back when this was announced with the original creators, I had small hopes that it will bring a faithful adaptation to the show...the only problem is that it's coming from Netflix. Then news came out that the original creators of the cartoon show quit production of the live action adaptation show and now I'm worried. I wasn't interested in watching the trailers because I was scared of Netflix ruining another beloved series with their decisions and Avatar: The Last Airbender holds a special place in my heart as a kid with its amazing world building, characters, story, and emotional rollercoaster.I finally watched Episode 1 and...it feels off. Not as bad as the The Last Airbender (2010) but not as good as the cartoon show. The effects were okay, the acting was...honest bad lol, I don't mind the new direction take but it was weirdly executed. I might try out Episode 2 but so far it's not a good start.","rating":"5\/10","date":"24 February 2024"}

And so much more and uncle Iroh just doesn't feel right. I guess the original will always be my favorite. Oh and suki, why are they becoming lovers, when first is Princess Yue, Sokkas first love. Come on now I feel bad for both characters in the show. Man the show needs work. I can't complain about the visuals , it was good. But the story is just not drawing me in. I stopped watching it, and just put on the original show. And man it just feels amazing. My childhood favorite show. Now I can summit this review.","rating":"3\/10","date":"24 February 2024"}

But as I watch it, I can't help but ask why? Why does this exist? Why recreate something that is already almost a perfect TV show? It doesn't matter how good it is, it will never be as good as the cartoon. It can't be. Also, condescending down all the episodes into 8 doesn't really work. Combining story lines together is a bit of a mess. I guess if you haven't seen the cartoon, it might be fine. But any fan of the cartoon will find it difficult to enjoy. I'll push through, but it can be frustrating at times.","rating":"5\/10","date":"23 February 2024"}
{"title":"soulless garbo","review":"I mean its on netflix.. we've all come to assume its going to be a soulless ,hollow,empty and rushed retelling of one of our fave stories. Why cant anyone get the live adaptions right? Ive seen to many animes made into live and they are all crappy! Death note was one of the most insulting until i watched this load of.. its rushed along with a ton of exposition rather then letting the story play out. The main characters lose their love-ability,uniqueness and likeability, they are just bad actors reading lines off a card. Very emotionless,empty and boring. The kid who plays aang seems ok,but the character acts like an adult not a light hearted,kind,bubbly kid. I cant stand zuko. He looks like a pudgy kid whos spoiled and sits around all day playing world of warcraft, not a neglected,abused,misguided teen trying to find his place in the world. The amount of adult scenes in this show is disturbing! From the people being burned alive screaming,to the creepy horny scenes. These are CHILDREN FOR GODS SAKE!! The original didnt have any of that and you can see how these writers dont know how to do a good story,a good story maintains its innocence, like every child deserves.The also smooshed eveything together in such a way that it looses meaning. 8 episodes is NOT enough to build characters and tell an amazing story. Some episodes and plots from the cartoon could be left out for sure, they werent vital,but so much that was vital is gone. Please leave this series alone and stop using it for money grabs! Just watch the original with your kids\/family\/friends and be happy.","rating":"1\/10","date":"25 February 2024"}
{"title":"Absolutely kneecapped the characters in the show","review":"The main draw of ATLA is the characters. Period. Over the course of the original show's episodes, you see them grow immensely in ways that are interesting and inspiring. The original show has impeccable writing.I have no idea what Netflix was thinking for this.The characters are flat. Katara is incredibly flat. Sokka is boring. Suki is an incredibly sexist stereotype of her original self. Aang is just boring.There is no chemistry between them. There's no growth for them over the course of the season. There's nowhere for them to go. And because the show can't get the writing done well, everything else falls flat and doesn't matter. Honestly the movie was at least interesting to watch.","rating":"3\/10","date":"25 March 2024"}
{"title":"Disgusting and lazy adaptation, transparent cash grab. IF YOU THINK THIS IS GOOD, LOG OFF","review":"I cannot express the amount of hatred I have for this piece of media. The time I spent watching this adaptation was all a waste, and is now time I can never recover. The amount of things changed out of PURE LAZINESS, anyone giving this a good rating should do themselves a favor and log off, don't review anything else. Breaking show canon for the sake of budget, or whatever reason they want to claim. Aang flying is absolute garbage. I cannot believe this is sitting at a 7, or that this was RENEWED.Iroh looks absolutely nothing like his original model, despicable considering the amount of love in the fanbase for this character. Zuko's scar looks like trash, they did it better in the live action movie, which is saying something considering how BAD that movie is. This review could be pages long, sometimes I lie awake at night furious that this adaptation even exists.IF YOU THINK THIS IS GOOD, WATCH THE ORIGINAL INSTEAD.","rating":"1\/10","date":"28 March 2024"}
{"title":"Looks amazing. That's it.","review":"The effects are great. The opening battle is really well done. That's about it. I stopped watching towards the end of the first episode. It's just another one of those terrible live action adaptations of a successful animation.The acting is wooden and emotionless. The dialogue feels like nothing more than exposition, which I expected in the animation as it's a trope in that medium. Here, it's tedious and off-putting.I didn't know much about the production until I gave a try tonight. After a quick Google search, I think it's clear why the original team decided \"creative differences\" were enough of a reason to step away.Watch the animation.","rating":"4\/10","date":"29 February 2024"}
{"title":"In a word: clunky","review":"If I'd never seen a minute of the animated series, I would have watched for the curiosity factor, and to see if what some were calling \"Game of Thrones for Kids\" was an accurate description. But I HAVE watched the animated series, probably four or five times start to finish. And as one who has, this can only be described as a slow and awkward slog through what could have been a great cinematic story. Instead, I found myself alternately bored, confounded, and ticked off.Stilted dialogue, poorly drawn characters, major plot changes, and mostly devoid of any BALANCE between youthful lightheartedness and coming-of-age conflict. Instead, we get PG-13 violence and G-rated dialogue - in the same scene, time after time. It plays as a stilted soap opera with limited connective tissue to the series that most viewers treasured. Why insult us and let us down this way for the sake of your own bizarre take on such an epic tale?But most of all, to draw Iroh as a fey, goofy, submissive extra is beyond the pale. He - and We deserved more respect. Anxiously awaiting the next animated entry in the Avatar collection.","rating":"5\/10","date":"24 February 2024"}
{"title":"Just a disappointing misuse of a great show","review":"The casting was well done and the acting is very good, but the adaptation is just too soulless.They wanted to appeal to a Game of Thrones audience but completely alienated fans of the animated show.Storylines that were fun and engaging on their own are now forced together and muddled\nThe exposition is cringey and speaks to the showrunners having no faith in their audience's ability to appreciate nuance and implications\nAnd all the personal growths the characters go through in the animated series vanish here because the character flaws they need to work through and grow through don't exist\nIn short, this is an extremely disappointing adaptation and I sincerely hope that the animated series gets a massive viewing boost to the point that the third animated series gets as big a budget as this thing.","rating":"4\/10","date":"16 March 2024"}
{"title":"Terrible adaptation, watch the anime","review":"This could honestly be a good show, if it was it's own thing. But it's not, it's an adaptation, however it seems to forget that pretty early into the first episode. While the effects, costumes, music and acting are all good if not great, the writing is such an absolute failure to who any of the characters are that all of that becomes secondary and isn't enough to save this show. I will say this though, they did seem to understand uncle Iroh pretty well and I loved getting to hear leaves from the vine as part of Iroh's theme, but everything else was a failure and doesn't even make sense. The main character is a 12 year old kid, he's even described throughout the series as being fun loving. For some reason that's never once shown, all we're shown is the depressed, guilt ridden and burdened chosen one. This becomes a repeated theme with most of the characters, they are toned down into one dimensional characters that are only there to service the plot. All of the depth and charisma that made these characters relatable to viewers has been stripped away. Bumi goes from a wise old man to a corrupt and bitter man who is actually trying to kill his friend. This is an absolute failure of an adaptation and does not deserve the name \"avatar: the last Airbender\"","rating":"1\/10","date":"16 March 2024"}
{"title":"Dissapointing","review":"Poor writing, poor acting, poor pacing, poor character development, poor casting (especially Azula and her crew), not funny, not fun.Such a missed opportunity. There's a reason why the original is so beloved. They should have let the creators of the original do their thing. You know its bad when cartoon characters convey more emotion, character and depth than their live action counterparts. By the time I reached the last episode, I just didn't care and wanted it to be over. I won't be keeping my Netflix subscription. I had Netflix for one month, just to watch The Social Dilemma, and this series reminded me why I canceled Netflix.Some of the sets looked nice and the color is good.","rating":"4\/10","date":"23 March 2024"}
{"title":"We almost redeemed the movie...","review":"It's unbelievably hard to recreate the character depth of the original cartoon. Two major notes that take away from from this series is the acting and the character visuals. To a lesser degree the writing was not true to character integrity.The main protagonists are young actors first getting into the industry and there is a lot to grow for them, however it really takes away from the story. The writing and directing goes along with not supporting these young actors.Second note is the character visuals are rough especially with makeup and prosthetics. Multiple key supporting characters, especially those depicting old age makeup and white wigs are overly dramatized and poorly executed.Lastly the writing attempts to stuff all of season 1 of the cartoon into 8 episodes. Worse though, character integrity is sinfully ignored, multiple original ideas are stuffed into 5 minutes of screen time that's not true to the Nickelodeon series, leaving gapping plot holes and very little room for expansion into follow on seasons.On a positive note, the visuals are breathtaking. The foreground CGI tends to conflict with background landscaping however. The fight scenes are masterfully choreographed and the visuals of the elemental bending are quite beautiful in their own right.","rating":"4\/10","date":"16 March 2024"}
{"title":"So I never finished it","review":"**UPDATE** 3\/8\nI never finished it. I keep falling asleep. It doesn't hold my attention the same way the animated show still does to this day. Plus the wigs??! Girl please. Why do they look like that?? Did all the money go to the vfx? They just bought some cheap thing off Amazon and didn't even have the decency to pluck the poor actors' hairlines? I'll try to finish again but it's not looking great.I've only watched the first episode so far. It's wonderfully casted, I like how they started with him before the 100 years as it fits well, and the scenery and cgi are beautiful. However, where is the charm? Where is the humor? While yes the show deals with traumatic elements and feelings, it also shows a lot of heart in the original as well. That's what had us all fall in love with it to begin with. I noticed a few key moments already that were nixed from this adaptation, and I just hope it's because it's the first episode and that they get back to the heart of the show and the characters. I have high hopes.","rating":"5\/10","date":"22 February 2024"}
{"title":"Netflix didn't want avatar they want to GOT so we got neither","review":"Netflix still has no idea how to create a good adaptation for an IP (besides One Piece where the original creator was involved in every step). For some reason They thought Avatar can be GOT, but it can't It can only be Avatar. The overdramatic tone of the show destroys a huge part of the magic that the animated series had which is balancing comedic, dramatic and heartwarming moments.It's bad enough that the original creators had to leave because Netflix disrespected their vision But on top of that the new creators have zero respect for the audience. Things that were alluded and built in the original series through the seasons are being spoonfed to the viewer with the grace of an elephant in a china shop.The cgi is mostly good though.","rating":"2\/10","date":"28 February 2024"}

Sit around a table, organize an outline of top story arcs from previous attempts and agree on canon. Use CGI to compliment scenes, not constitute them, lest 1) your writing will have no premise for old fans to relate to, and 2) new fans won't follow already proven relatable story lines.And who requires character length for film reviews?They should have had plot hole requirements for ATLA reboots, cuz this was their last chance than they such.,","rating":"3\/10","date":"6 March 2024"}
{"title":"Injustice to the Original","review":"This TV series is not faithful at all to the original animated series. The characters are watered down, due to the inexperienced acting and poor script writing. The story line does not make sense because they changed several things, while keeping original things that no longer fit within the story it has created. They did a really good job on the special effects, but that is all that I can say good about this show. It's strange how they are unable to build any tension with the changes they made, for we already know everything ahead of time and are acquainted with all of the characters in the beginning.","rating":"3\/10","date":"19 March 2024"}
{"title":"The ember island players version of Avatar","review":"Flat acting and lost plot points have derailed this adaptation. There are few good things to say about this adaptation: the CGI does an amazing job and the darker tone of the adaptation is very welcome; but these do little to save a floundering attempt to adapt this story. So many aspects of the characters are lost along the way and much of that falls to bad acting and story\/script choices that make it understandable why the series creators parted ways during production. This ultimately feels like an earnest attempt at telling this story but falls closer to that told by the ember island players.","rating":"3\/10","date":"8 March 2024"}

And you expect me to watch 3-4 seasons of them?The effects are great, except on the opening for some reason. Everything has a weird motion blur on the first episode, making it look worst than spiderman from 20 years ago. But the sets are fantastic, HD, and full of life. So why is the show overall bad? Its really just the acting, or dialogue. Its always hard to tell which one is leading to such poor scenes where it feels like the characters are pretending to be bad on purpose.I cant tell, but I cant watch any more than 1 episode.","rating":"3\/10","date":"4 March 2024"}

Like, who is rushing the show to be over so we needed to have Omashu hold all these characters in one episode. I can't think of a character that really held their own except Commander Zhao, who isn't even a lead.I think they turned Appa into a Pok\u221a\u00a9mon because that mammoth somehow vaporizes when he isn't needed. Why does Kyoshi show Aang the avatar state and not Roku.A lot of people will say they crushed it in CGI and atmosphere, but honestly that's hardly true.

The show however its taking the original show totally out of proportion and rushed the story and character development so everything seems so insignificant and boring. Its like the people behind the show didn't understand at all what made the original one of the best shows ever. Putting fight scenes and okay good graphics meanwhile mash different storylines throughout different seasons and episodes was such a horrible decisions. Me and my girlfriend are huge supporters of the original and rewatch once a year so we really tried to give the adaptation a chance.

{"title":"Big let down","review":"Without mentioning the many details that either didn't happen and needed to, or was completely unnecessary but happened anyway, I'll just say that having to force myself to watch this series was a pretty good indicator of how horribly written, produced and directed it was. There were several times that I even had to rewind long segments because I checked my phone and ended up watching FB reels for 30 minutes. One of the main issues for me was the casting. Not any of the main characters had that je na sais quoi and were often forced to deliver lines that sounded more like they were written for an after school special than a major Netflix production.","rating":"5\/10","date":"25 February 2024"}

I am very disappointed in this 'remake' but what can you expect from any type of remake.I do like the effects this story has and i understand with a limited series, episodes needed to be cut, but it honestly upsets me that so many episodes are jammed into one.One thing the writers need to improve on is scripting, the loss of satire is just disappointing and is what made the original show so enjoyable to watch.

{"title":"I did expect much. But what is this.","review":"This series has stunning visuals, but it misses the heart of the beloved original. The special effects are incredible, especially the bending sequences. They also nailed the casting of Suki and Sokka. Sadly, Aang's portrayal falls flat. His childlike wonder and sincerity are missing, making his lines feel forced. Katara and Zuko also lack the depth of their animated counterparts. Worse, they've cut key scenes that define Aang's character and relationships. Remember the iceberg and his awakening with Katara? The playful penguin sledding? Those moments showed his need for friendship and fun, not just the weight of his destiny. While they got the look right, this version lacks the original's warmth, humor, and sense of adventure. It feels rushed and overly serious. Ultimately, this adaptation focuses on surface-level elements instead of the true essence of 'Avatar'. Aang's honesty, strength, and playful spirit were what made the original so special.","rating":"1\/10","date":"25 February 2024"}
{"title":"Feels rushed, +1 star for inclusion of Secret Tunnel","review":"Don't go into this hoping for the same storyline and character development as the original series. I see a lot of reviewers giving this adaptation 3+ stars and saying \"it's not as bad as the movie\", but that doesn't mean that it's good.I will say, the set design and CGI (especially when it comes to the bending) is fantastic, and the music sounds pretty on par with that of the original series.Other than that, the whole season feels incredibly rushed and story lines were combined in ways that take away from the original (and incredible) plot development. We lose the entire pirate episode to Gran Gran simply ~giving~ Katara the water bending scroll. King Bumi, the Freedom Fighters, and Sai & Teo are all crammed into one episode. There are many more instances of this rushed writing that take away from the great storytelling of the original, but those examples are just the first 4 episodes. Aang, Katara, and Sokka all seem to spend more time apart on their own adventures than together as a team. Most of the acting and dialogue felt awkward and either lacking of emotion or overly dramatic, but my biggest complaint is the characters themselves. I understand that an adaptation is not going to be an exact replication of the original series, but I feel like the writers took away pivotal characteristics and flaws that created character arcs that captivated an entire generation with the original series. Aang is not the same goofy, immature young boy who must make peace with his own destiny and learn discipline. Katara is not the same motherly, somewhat bossy figure who must learn that things don't always go according to plan and that she can't protect everyone from misfortune. Sokka's humor & sarcasm was dialed way back, and although his character was misogynistic in the original series, I feel like some valuable lessons were conveyed by him learning that women can be strong, intelligent, and independent just as easily as men- which so far has been almost completely erased by this adaptation. The biggest crime, however, is the fact that Appa and MoMo are basically nonexistent aside from a couple scenes here and there of Appa flying or MoMo eating a fruit.Again, I understand that it's an adaptation and won't perfectly mirror the original, but if you're going to cut out so many of the storylines and character traits that made us fall in love with the original Avatar series, why not just create a brand new one for the audience to go into without any expectations to live up to?I would've only given 1 star, but they DID include \"SECRET TUNNELLLLLL\" (kind of) so I must give credit where credit is due.","rating":"2\/10","date":"28 February 2024"}

{"title":"Deeply flawed, improvement suggestions for season 2+","review":"CONS sadly outweigh PROS (yes, there are some). Quick lists below with most important issues + suggestions for future improvement expanded upon.I write this review out of constructive love with the hope any actors or show writers see this prior to season 2.ProsCinematography and large sets 9\/10Bending effects 8\/10ConsScript\/writing 2\/10Casting 4\/10 (ethnic casting and visually accurate representation is great but actual \"acting\" is very hit or miss).Music 5\/10 (score was good but was present too much of the time. We don't need single tone brass and strings over every single piece of dialogue. Give the actors a chance to carry the scene!)Costumes 7\/10 (mostly look great. Would love to see them more weathered and grimy but this nitpick is so far down the list of issues).Dispelling mythsAs much as I was wanted to but was unable to enjoy the show, I deeply admire all the actors for giving their best! It's silly for reviewers to suggest they weren't invested in doing their best to do right by the fandom and their characters.Pacing & Character DynamicsThe biggest issue from which many sub issues stem is they attempted to cover TOO much storyline. This led to not near enough time to develop the relationships between the main characters. Dialogue in scenes doesn't last enough time. Camera is often moving. In short, there is NO character development and NO chemistry among the Gaang. Somehow with 8 one hour episodes the story feels so rushed. Key character growth and moments of audience realization are TOLD instead of SHOWN. This makes it very hard for the audience to be emotionally invested. It is an unforgivable sin, which makes it very difficult to care continue watching beyond the mess that is episodes 3 & 4.My opinion prior to watching the show is I definitely wanted a high fidelity interpretation of the source animation with understanding exact 1:1 is unrealistic. It seems the show writers couldn't decide whether to do this at times versus breaking from the source more liberally. We're whisked from place to place and scene to scene without any resonance. In hindsight, I would've cut more of the source and chosen to expand key scenes to last longer (ex: Aang being shunned from his friend group on air scooters, learning of the genocide against his people, etc). This would have required more creativity and new dialogue but it also would have been far truer to the essence of the character instead of what we got.Acting castSadly, many of the multifaceted characters we love in the show were reduced to single faceted caricatures. This manifests in various ways for each character.Aang - He is constantly told things by past avatars and other characters. He talks about doing things but never does them. Worst of all he is too solemn and not playful enough. His character arc lacks the fun and charm of a 12-year old who slowly comes to terms with the gravity of his responsibilities. Didn't waterbend once even though this was the purpose of his journey to the North. Not confident in himself (he is the youngest airbender master after all!) Unforgivable changes (he's a kid who ran away after learning he was the avatar which is understandable for a kid, what is NOT realistic is him going away to calmly \"think about things\" like a fully developed adult).Katara - Lacks emotion. Shown as a master without any practice. Katara in the animations is fierce but also motherly, loyal and emotional! This actress is too meek and doesn't seem to match facial emotions to the lines she delivers. There is just nothing to draw you in to make you care about her character. Weakest of all the casting in my opinion.Sokka - Too stiff. Not enough fun and jokes. Already seen as a leader of men in episode 1 and isn't given the opportunity to grow into the role. Does have some solid moments but they're too few and far between.Gaang together - They just don't have any chemistry. There was no time for them to bond over extended dialogue. No scenes where they could have developed relationships without pushing the plot relentlessly forward. Their motivations are so surface level and don't make sense half of the time. Where is totally realistic sibling bickering? Instead Sokka and Katara are constantly having level headed adult therapy talks between themselves about their absent father instead of kids trying to make sense of it all.All these actors suffer from horrible scripts and the relentless pace of the show. They were not set up to succeed (ex: they talk about being a family instead of showing the audience they are a family through their actions), .This makes it hard to know whether the lack of group connection is solely the show writers fault or whether the kids (specifically Aang and Katara) just don't have the range to convey multifaceted characters. What's perplexing is in cast interview segments on YouTube they do seem to have chemistry and the Sokka actor seems very Sokka and funny, but where was this in the show!?Zuko - Strongest of the mains. Is able to effectively show a range most of the time. Great fighting style. Most emotionally connected with him.Iroh - Ok I guess.Ozai - Great.Azula - Really poor. Not scary at all. Shouldn't have even been in this season. Can't tell if it's so flat and non intimidating because all her scenes are silly training sessions meant to show how fierce she is or the actress fault.What I'd do differentlySomeone involved on the project said they wanted to appeal to game of thrones fans and everyone freaked out. Honestly, they could have taken many lessons from game of thrones. Not the blood and gore, but the incredible long dialogue scenes. We love that show because yes it is high fantasy, but after you accept this fact the world operates by predictable rules. The characters are so deep and the relationships so nuanced. That epitomizes everything this show is missing.Instead of doing the whole first season of the animation they should have done half. They should have (1) picked out specific very key scenes in the animation where characters grow, where the audience is made privy to a big reveal after tension\/mystery has been stewing, (2) expanded upon these scenes creatively, and (3) cut all the rest. Think about what they animation is conveying to us emotionally or the character is learning. Then translate this to scene in a game of thrones style dialogue scene where we are SHOWN not TOLD. Yes, it would be more different than the animation visually, but it would be TRUER emotionally and far deeper. THIS is what we are craving. While we love the world (and for the most part the CGI team and sets looked great), we love the characters more. If the characters weren't so amazing in the animation and it only had cool martial arts it might still appeal to some but it would not be the classic it is.Is this harder to do than what was produced? Yes. Does it require true creativity to analyze and distill the key animation lessons, then write much dialogue that isn't in the source? Yes. But it would have been SOOOOO much better.Please, for season 2. Cut the narrative scope in half. Don't make everything advance the plot. Find a way for the characters to grow and show a wider range (if that's possible with the current casting...).And one more thing. Choose a few key real life settings and do more outdoors acting. This was another thing game of thrones did great. While the wide ranging views of Omashu and the North Pole and Air Temples are visually pleasing from above, there is too much small set indoor green screen. This inevitably has to be hard for actors to get into their bag than a natural outdoor setting, and even more so for kid actors.Thank you for your attempt. I respect the effort that went into this. Unfortunately, in the real world we are judged on execution, not effort. And in this case the execution of translating the characters from animation to live action fell horribly flat. Maybe people who consume tons of content and are content with visual spectacle will enjoy it. But for anyone who selectively consumes shows and seeks deep and emotional performances, this sadly misses the mark.But there is an opportunity to improve. The avatar world is so deep. I hope they get an opportunity to improve in a longer season 2 which isn't as aggressive in moving the plot relentlessly forward.","rating":"4\/10","date":"23 February 2024"}
{"title":"Not terrible, but definitely not great.","review":"I tried very hard to keep my expectations realistic for this release, but after finishing the season, it still managed to come in a little below the bar. Most of that is due to some really questionable changes to the storyline, very unfaithful character writing, and some really poor acting from most of the cast.For the storyline changes, I understand that they wanted to compress the first season, but they also felt the need to smash just about every story element into the runtime. This causes most things to barely be glossed over, like they are cutting puzzle pieces in order to get them to fit, but after its done, the whole picture ends up looking wrong. Episodes 2-4 are a good example of this. The whole Omashu arc is super messy.My main issue with the show though is how they handle each of the characters. They are changed in ways that break their core personalities completely, and this is in my opinion, what will hold this show back from being anything more than just another subpar Netflix remake.Lets break some of those characters down as an exampleAang -Aang is fairly close to faithful and the actor playing him does pretty well. Some of his line delivery is not great, but it is passable. However, they have removed a lot of his character's trepidation and there isn't a lot of growth over the season. He just wakes up, understands what he has to do, and goes for it. They also changed the events that led to him being frozen in ice, which removed his guilt for not being around to some degree. I genuinely don't understand this change.Overall, I would give Aang a \"B-\"Sokka -Sokka is pretty solid throughout the season. He's nowhere near as comical and again, doesn't really change or grow much since they flattened his character so much. My biggest complaint though is that he doesn't deliver his lines very well. Things that could be funny just don't tend to land well.I give Sokka an \"B\"Katara -I hate bashing on actors and in no way should anyone be rude or mean to people from the show, but man, Katara is not good. She is absolutely lifeless and her lines are pretty flat across the board. There is also absolutely ZERO chemistry between her and Aang. Meadow Kingfisher, who plays young Katara is SOOOOO much better in the few scenes she has.I give Katara a \"C-\"Zuko -Zuko is... fine. He isn't very Zuko like, but he is ok. He doesn't feel angry or particularly driven like he is in the original, he just feels like a kid who wants to impress his dad, and is whining about everything that gets in his way.I give Zuko a \"C\"Iroh -Iroh is awful. Truly awful. They changed him from an understanding, wise person who was broken by the loss of his son and was forced to re-examine himself and change into what he is when the show takes place, into just a generic old guy who follows Zuko around. It is beyond my understanding why they did this. He is such a well-defined character that it would have been so easy to nail his writing. There is also zero humor in his lines. The actor playing him seems stressed or unsure constantly. I could go on and on about how dirty they did Iroh in this show, but I'll stop there.I give Iroh a giant red \"F\"King Bumi -Bumi is another one that is changed nearly beyond recognition. They again changed a wise, eccentric character into just kind a bitter old weirdo. They missed the mark on this one. And the makeup is awful, lol.I give King Bumi a normal \"F\"Azula -Again, I hate bashing on actors, but this one is a big miss from multiple angles. The actress playing Azula either didn't understand the source material, or just doesn't have the range to pull it off. Her writing is also very poor, as they seem to be turning her more into a sneaky, conniving person instead of a confident, capable, driven psychopath.I give Azula a \"C-\"Mai & Ty Lee -Mai & Ty Lee are just sort of set pieces. Background characters in the lunch room in a Mean Girls musical production. They're very flat and lifeless, and it feels like they are just reading lines every time they are onscreen.Mai And Ty Lee get a \"C-\"Roku -Roku has been changed in a happy, goofy old man. This is fine, but a weird choice. I don't understand why they chose to do this, since it doesn't really add anything. His delivery is OK.I give Roku a \"C+\"Appa & MomoBarely present, lol. I think you see each of them maybe twice throughout the season.The CGI for the bending effects are pretty good, but it would be nice if they accentuated the martial arts aspect more than they do. Sometimes it comes off more like they are casting spells rather than bending.Overall, no one in the cast stands out. At best, they are approaching acceptable, but no one manages to reach it, and many characters fall significantly short.TL;DR - Plotlines are smashed together haphazardly and character assassination is very much present throughout the entire season. This is not nearly as terrible as the movie, but is a far cry from the animated series.","rating":"5\/10","date":"23 February 2024"}
{"title":"Good visuals, nothing else","review":"The only reason this gets any stars is because the people behind the visuals did great. You can really tell they care. The writing is abysmal, its like someone took a well written joke, then tried to retell it without understanding the joke. You took a show so well written that there are hours upon hours of video essays analyzing it then turned it into trash. I'm not saying the story should be 100% the same, but they keep some things and change others so its contradictory and shallow, like how the characters are have become. The only character that wasn't completely butchered was maybe Zhao LOL. I am struggling to think of any character in the live action that is just as good as in the original. The pacing is weird, they try to combine episodes that have nothing in common. There's so many things wrong with it that you'd have to type up pages just to explain them all. I can see why the original creators left the production, it really shows.","rating":"4\/10","date":"2 April 2024"}
{"title":"Horrendous acting","review":"The new Avatar series fails to live up to its potential on multiple fronts. Firstly, the casting of amateur actors detracts from the authenticity and depth of the characters, making it difficult for viewers to emotionally invest in the storyline. Additionally, the writing is lackluster, with cheesy dialogue that fails to capture the essence of the original series. This combination results in a subpar viewing experience, leaving fans disappointed and longing for the nuanced storytelling and compelling performances of its predecessor. With better casting choices and improved writing, the series could have been a worthy addition to the Avatar franchise, but unfortunately, it falls short of expectations.","rating":"2\/10","date":"18 March 2024"}
{"title":"Talking about Avatar","review":"I don't know why Netflix went through the trouble of special effects. This is, after all, primarily an audio drama. All dialog. All exposition. Tell don't show. It's a pain to watch. Like a podcast at 0.75x speed. Towards the end of the show, you hear about all these supposed adventures and fights team avatar has had. The legend of Aang has spread! Where? What adventures? Off camera? Because on camera it's just three kids talking about how important their duties are. How important everything is. How important this all is! And they skipped Aang training? Maybe he got caught up in talking about training and forgot to do it.None of the usual charm or humor. On top of it all, so many stories got compressed into a few episodes. What about all the character development? How these characters evolved in the cartoon? Well, just junk to the end! Take away all the development and leave them starting off pretty great already.Avatar showed flaws, growth, improvement. This is just talking about the Avatar.God, even the Ember Island Players knew to show a few fight scenes, even if they did get the scar on the wrong side.Some great casting choices here, while others may need to become a bit more comfortable in their role. Maybe there's a chance for another season, but my guess is, Netflix doesn't want to put in the investment or effort to make this what it should be.","rating":"3\/10","date":"25 February 2024"}
{"title":"Its way below my expectations","review":"I was looking forward for this release for years. And now that is live, I couldn't watch it to the end.The magic about the cartoons, specially first and second seasons, was that that the Fire lord was just a shadow. You never see him. He is like Voldemort, like Sauron, its powerful, people fear him but we have no idea how he looks. Its just reputation of evilness.And what did netflix do? They show him right off the bat. Azula on first season as well? They totally spoiled the big characters on the first season for no reason.Adding to that, I don't think the child actors are that good. Many failed attempts of making me laugh with Soka that are a failure. Aang is depressed like the movie. There is no chemistry inside Team Avatar and as such I feel nothing too.Aang can fly as well. The episode with Bumi is super confusing.Waste of money, waste of time. Better rewatch the cartoon again.Giving 3 for the visuals and wardrobe.","rating":"3\/10","date":"25 February 2024"}
{"title":"Gorgeous Effects, Great Actors, Horrible Writing","review":"I would like to start off by saying your Visual effects team knocked it out of the park. Visual effects, Bending Techniques, Scene's all amazing. ATLA is all about the character development and their interactions with the world as the Avatar tries to learn the other three elements. This is the main reason the original show is so beloved. There was way too much liberty in changing characters, luke warm acting, and way too much explaining by characters because the show writers didn't take the time to do it correctly. Characters are all over the place, story seems way rushed, and important episodes were mashed together creating confusing story arcs. An ex. Is they made Jet a terrorist in omashu, Only Katara and Saka go through the Secret Tunnel, or the story arc with Koh the face stealer.Another huge change is Azula doesn't have blue fire, she seems more like a petulent child then one of the main atognists, and wow does General Zhao just seem flat. Once again I feel like Netflix has ruined something good.. Next time you pick up an adaptation just stick to the original and it will succeed.","rating":"5\/10","date":"26 February 2024"}
{"title":"first episode, already 13 things altered\/made worse","review":"1: removed sokka's entire character buildup of sexism issues with \"oh no, we're drifting into this giant iceberg\" instead of pissing off katara with his sexist attitude which brought forth aang's iceberg bubble, and instead just stream slid into a iceberg to crash land on his icy platform. And instead of furious unintended water bending by katara, she instead triggered it by trying to pull their drifting boat back2: Zuko's fury isn't furious enough3: Aang doesn't wake up until they are at the water tribe, and he uses his bison whistle he doesn't get until episode 9 in the cartoon, bringing in his flying bison, thus several sarcastic lines were thrown away for sokka4: So far only katara delivered a sarcastic line. Sokka's left with just \"i'm the warrior leader of the village now, we're at war\" attitude, doesn't even sarcastically say \"splash around with magic water\", nope!

{"title":"Was very disappointed....","review":"I recently watched the live-action adaptation of Avatar: The Last Airbender on Netflix, and I was very disappointed. I'm a huge fan of the original animated series, and I was really looking forward to seeing it brought to life in a new way. However, the live-action adaptation fell far short of my expectations.The biggest problem with the movie is the writing. The dialogue is cheesy and unnatural, and the plot is full of holes. The characters are also underdeveloped, and it's hard to care about what happens to them.In addition to the writing problems, the movie also suffers from poor directing and acting. The fight scenes are uninspired, and the special effects are laughably bad. The cast does their best, but they're given little to work with.Overall, I was very disappointed with the live-action adaptation of Avatar: The Last Airbender. It's a poorly made film that doesn't do justice to the original animated series. If you're a fan of the show, I recommend avoiding this movie.","rating":"2\/10","date":"23 February 2024"}
{"title":"Meh... Where's the magic?","review":"This show is too rushed to tell the correct story. I mean they had the blueprint right in front of them and they decided this was better? It's just as bad as the live action movie in the sense that it does not faithfully follow the story we all love from the animated series. All they had to do was follow the original, scene for scene, and they would have had the best live action series ever. Instead we get hundreds of close up shots of characters we don't care about delivering lines that continually fall flat. Where is the comedy? Where is the heart? Where is the magic? The ferocity? The love?After finishing this I revisited the animated series of 2003 and within the first minutes I was laughing and smiling and wanting the best for the characters. That is something I did not feel once for the characters in this live action retelling. It just fails to deliver and will continue to fail to deliver on the same feelings that the much loved and carefully produced animated series gave us.","rating":"5\/10","date":"28 February 2024"}
{"title":"Amateurish character development\/storytelling, bad acting and illogical bendings","review":"The worst character progression\/development I've ever seen recently. I don't know anything about the animation but I hope it's better.Instead of showing character motives and development through the characters themselves, they tell. A LOT.An example is when a certain character is the way they are; either show through flashbacks or develop them from the present instead of another character pointing out why they're like that and going: it's because....then flashback. WHAT?!!Katara's arc is the most noticeable. How do you go from that to that in a span of days and challenge a man who's been practising his whole life? You can do empowerment and feminism in plausible and earnest ways you know. Make it feel earned without sacrificing what makes a story a story.And Aang saying he needs to master other elements and not try once was also weird. He didn't only say it once but it's like the whole point of the story and it never takes the front seat of the story. Why? Isn't that the whole point of the show?Don't get started on the Gen Z princess and her mates. Atrocious acting. It felt like they were interrupted shooting TikToks.Lastly, what's with the bendings? Is it like that in the original version? A fire bender will throw flames at another bender or even a non-bender but on impact, it's like just being... slapped. How? It's with every fight. There should singes, bruises, shrapnels etc. But nothing. All that throwing and dancing.5\/5 stars just for the visuals and for making me intrigued to watch the animated version.","rating":"5\/10","date":"28 February 2024"}
{"title":"Disappointing Adaptation: Netflix's Avatar: The Last Airbender Falls Flat","review":"Netflix's attempt at translating the beloved world of Avatar: The Last Airbender into a live-action series falls flat, taking a different approach that, unfortunately, results in a lackluster adaptation. While the decision to follow a linear narrative might cater to newcomers, it comes at the cost of sacrificing the very essence that made the original animated series exceptional.One positive aspect of the Netflix adaptation is its commitment to a straightforward narrative, progressing seamlessly from phase A to Z. This structure may appeal to those unfamiliar with the original storyline, providing a clear and concise introduction to the world of bending. However, this positive shift is overshadowed by the disappointing deviations from the characters and moments that fans hold dear.One of the most glaring letdowns is the absence of Aang's playful nature. In the cartoon, Aang's carefree spirit and playful antics were a vital part of his character, offering a balance to the more serious aspects of the plot. Regrettably, the live-action Aang seems to lack the joyful exuberance that made him a relatable and endearing character in the first place.Sokka, known for his quick wit and humorous one-liners, suffers a similar fate in the Netflix adaptation. The absence of Sokka's comedic charm robs the series of a significant source of entertainment and fails to capture the essence of this beloved character. It's a disheartening oversight that diminishes the overall appeal of the show.Moreover, the live-action version neglects many of the key moments that defined the original series. The emotional depth and character development that were integral to the cartoon are sacrificed, leaving viewers with a watered-down and less impactful version of the story. The omission of these crucial moments is a disappointment for long-time fans who expected a faithful adaptation.Perhaps one of the most significant letdowns is the portrayal of Zuko, who in the Netflix adaptation, lacks the intimidating presence that made him a formidable antagonist. Instead of a complex and menacing character, Zuko comes across as a mere caricature with an angry expression, stripping away the depth that made him such a compelling figure in the animated series.In conclusion, while Netflix's decision to adopt a linear storytelling approach may have its merits, the sacrifice of Aang's playfulness, Sokka's wit, and the omission of key moments from the original series make this adaptation a disappointment for fans. The live-action version fails to capture the magic of the animated series, leaving audiences longing for the genuine character dynamics and memorable moments that defined the original Avatar: The Last Airbender.","rating":"3\/10","date":"24 February 2024"}

They have just sucked out all of the joy and happiness and subtlety out of this show and given us some rushed boring drivel. The actors are absolutely emotionless and it feels like listening to a robot when they talk. The show suffers so much from telling and not showing with characters making asinine speeches and the dialogue is absolutely clunky and it feels like it actually was written by ChatGPT, because what is this:Sokka: remember what dad told us yadaaa\nKatara: but remember what mom told us! YadaaaaAang: mourning and being traumatized by seeing his mentors and peers dead after 100 years and feeling immense amounts of guilt (which the actor absolutely fails to show)\nKatara: But you will never become powerful unless you lose ;))And the cherry on top being uncle Iroh, who was the life of the original show, now absolutely minimized to some generic old guy that just blurts out static lines instead of the kind, wise, complicated uncle Iroh that kept trying to guide his nephew in a very calm and subtle manner.

But watching this remake miss the point of episodes past again and again was painful. It randomly swaps around episodes from later seasons with no real reasoning, and it doesn't benefit to bring these in at all.The new things they added like seeing the Airbender attack and the emphasis on gyatso also fail to bring anything new or exciting to the table. The acting and script are wooden, with no real emotions brought in.The things I will praise are the designs. Bending looks better than the other live-action attempt, and the environments and actors look good.This is being written before seasons 2-3, so maybe it will get better, but I don't plan to watch those due how mediocre this first season is.","rating":"2\/10","date":"8 April 2024"}
{"title":"Katara's Violent Aggression to Aboriginal Culture","review":"My concern was this adaptation would lack the comedy present in the cartoon, which added to its charm. Turns out I should have had bigger concerns.I enjoyed the visuals. The story was good. The world building was great until the final episode of season 1.It really needed more time to tell this story properly. The producers have a rushed story here and in that, an incomplete tale full of holes and shallow characters. With at least two more episodes, they could have created a story of characters I could empathise with.Spoiler alert is you have year to see episode 8.But the worst part all happens in the finale of season 1. I've been onboard with the series until this episode. So Katara gets to the northern tribe where women water bend to heal only. The tribe tell her that is their culture and it's been like this forever and they are all happy and content with their culture and lives. Katara, in her arrogance and self-righteousness, in not respecting another people's culture and customs, doesn't agree with the entire tribe's values and beliefs, so she, in an act of aggression against a people she doesn't know and clearly doesn't respect, attacks and fights one of their male leaders. Later in the episode, Katara walks off screen and next minute, Katara and all the women of the tribe now want to fight for some reason. What did Katara say to change an entire tribe's beliefs and values and cultural practices? We don't know - it happened off camera. I guess that speech would have been too difficult to write. Then, for the marysue moment of the episode, all of a sudden the women are warriors and are water bending better than the men who have been training for half their lives. Remember, the only water bending the women ever did was to heal. How can they have learned in a minute, how to fight as good as their male counterparts who have been practicing for years?!Also! Why has Ang not been practicing other bending?Furthermore, Momo dies and I'm meant to care? The character's been in the show for all of five seconds. He dies and a woman picks him up and leaves with his body to save his life. Surrounded by her friends and family, who are dead and dying or still fighting, she picks up a dead animal she saw that one time, and leaves the battle to save its life and not those of her friends and family she has know her entire life and who she is meant to be leading!None of this makes any sense and because of these points, this episode ruined a series that was going along quite well.","rating":"5\/10","date":"7 March 2024"}

{"title":"Fantastic VFX but a painful watch for lovers of the originals.","review":"The idea of this show is quite good, condense the cartoon into a live action series, and retell the story from the beginning while already knowing every single plot point coming in the seasons to come. HOWEVER, the way the writers have shortened the episodes takes away from many of the important character moments that make the original cartoon so endearing. Many of the moments that had specific characters together for their development had been shifted around in a way that makes the moments fall flat. I had high hopes for this show when the original writers were on board. When they left I lost almost all hope for the production. After watching the rollercoaster that is the first three episodes I was hopeful again that maybe the changes they were making could be for the best, while condensing the longer parts of the series. But no. Unfortunately they seemed to just be tossing important episodes and characters into a blender and seeing which ones come out and just jamming them together into a story. Sometimes it works sometimes it does not at all.The direction is stiff and blocky. In no way do I think the actors are necessarily bad, I do however think that the writing and directing made it hard for the actors to show any emotion.Another thing I'm sorely missing from the original is the attention to detail. Many times in the show I found things that were just so slightly wrong and inattentive to the source material. I could go on but I have to go to bed.

{"title":"I hardly recognize Jimmy Nail as the Avatar","review":"The last air spender is a TV show series that is set in Newcastle upon Tyne and focuses on the life and exploits of Detective Sergeant Freddie AirSpender, who was often chosen to carry out more daring police cases. With his criminal sidekick Stick (Sammy Johnson),This must be a reboot of the original story, for one Jimmy has a massive 'go fast' stripe tattooed on his head, and when he gets angry he gets 'the look', similar I would imagine to having a roid rage.Places like Benwell, Howdon, Wallsend, Byker is made to look fantastic, the CGI team have done a great job as for decades local councils have turned these places into toilets.Even Sammy looks younger, he wears a load of white dominos around his neck and has a nose you could do a base jump from.All in all, this is an enjoyable romp amongst the villains of Tyneside and the wider area, while being chased by a guy who's got hot hands.I don't normally watch shows like this, but it's cold outside and I have nothing else to watch... oh wait, I should watch Shogun, I hear good things about it.","rating":"5\/10","date":"2 March 2024"}

Many important aspects of the show are not explained well enough.

But again I was overall very disappointed in this adaptation.I went expecting change and slight character alterations but I didn't expect it to feel so flat. None of the characters have dimension. Iroh: wise Zuko: upset (not even hot headed just upset) Katara: no personality, Sokka: the best little funny, flirty and strong I liked his character and Aang: scared. That is all they were. It felt like all of Aangs lines were I'm scared monologues.The world consisted of so much and was dwindled to like 4 locations.They changed too much and I was bored.On a positive note I really liked the visuals and there were a few scenes (opening) that had me bawling.But overall just a drag.","rating":"5\/10","date":"26 February 2024"}
{"title":"Where's the fun??","review":"Sad sack Aang, heavy handed dialogue and a focus on the brutality of war is NOT the Avatar we know and love. Having a trickster main character who is a playful child is supposed to be the cornerstone to this series! Why take out riding all the animals? Why not have him train waterbending with Katara? Very confusing choices all around. Sokka is the closest to the original, with some much needed jokes, but that's not enough to make up for the depressed version of Aang. The attempt to combine multiple episode storylines is also clunky and forced. I guess they needed to tighten the story for the number of episodes, but it doesn't feel like the writers understood the intent of the original script. Very disappointing.","rating":"4\/10","date":"24 February 2024"}
{"title":"Fundamentally Altered","review":"Netflix's live-action adaptation of \"Avatar: The Last Airbender\" is a visually stunning series with high production values, but it deviates significantly from the beloved original cartoon. The most glaring issue arises in the first episode, where firebenders are shown effortlessly producing fire from thin air. This contradicts the original series, where only a few highly trained firebenders could perform such a feat, fundamentally altering the established lore.The original \"Avatar\" was celebrated for its rich mythology and nuanced character development, aspects that feel compromised in this adaptation. The changes to the bending mechanics undermine the careful balance and world-building that made the cartoon so compelling.","rating":"5\/10","date":"17 May 2024"}
{"title":"Pretty Okay ishhh?","review":"So, I am on episode 4. MY opinion:1. 50% of actors TOTALLY do not look or act like their originals in Tv Cartoon Episodes.2. Effects and graphics are a decent great 9\/103. The script and dialogue is very robotic in 50% of actors do NOT know how to act EMOTIONS that they are saying...amateur Director.4. Everything is all over place and not in order like it was in a movie and some script is changed and it makes me mad!5. Very BAD and CHEAP job at making Bald masks and old wrinkles for actors.

{"title":"Please watch the original animated show if you haven't already.","review":"I never write reviews but couldn't help myself because this one made me genuinely annoyed to watch. Fans of the original animated series can see how much was butchered. It was a perfect story that didn't need messing with. And if it did, not like this.Understandable why the original creators abandoned the project. The only good thing were the SFX.Completely removed character growth arcs like Sokkas sexism for example (only to be humbled over multiple series). Why is his dad a knob to him now? Aang doesn't seem to have a clue about waterbending or much of anything even by the end of the series. The acting was robotic, it had no heart or humour. The story was randomly inserting parts that don't happen til later on like Azula and Ozai and changing others for no apparent reason. What was wrong with the pirate storyline from the original show which was a key driver? Why were Katara and Sokka in the caves on their own (from the second series) when that's a key part in Aang and Katara's romance story? Koh took up more than it should and is abducting people? Bringing Sokka and Katara into the spirit world just cause they were nearby? Guessing there's no spirit library? Where is Jeong-Jeong? The list goes on and on.Should have just made something totally different from the same world rather than just throwing a load of scenes into a hat chopping them up with poor writing and seeing what comes out.That 2010 film set the bar so low that anything looks good against it. Waited a long time for this. Really disappointed. Watch the original animated series if you never have and feel like the concept is something you enjoyed, it's one of the best ever made. This is a pale shadow.","rating":"2\/10","date":"24 February 2024"}
{"title":"I don't recommend it","review":"I don't recommend it. I watched the first episode, but I quit halfway through. The performances were unbearable, special effects okay until the firebending part, which is dreadful. Sokka and Katara don't look or act like they're from a tribe. The truth is, all the actors perform as if they're at a cosplay event. The actor playing Aang doesn't deliver, as Aang is a tragic hero, and the actor doesn't convey the suffering and doubt to the audience. Another problem I encountered while watching this series is the exchange of interesting dialogues for weak and expositional ones, and the casting of actors to play Azula and Zuko. The actors don't work.","rating":"2\/10","date":"23 February 2024"}
{"title":"So much wrong about this","review":"I went into this wanting to like it but within 2 epsodes it really fell flat. The only pro was the effects looked good. To start the cons, the acting and dialog were uninteresting and the only character that felt like they put in effort was Commander Zhao. It's apparent that they wanted to make a goofy cartoon into something gritty which really leaves an awkward feeling in the overarching tone. The way they changed Sokka was kind of awkward. Like i get not wanting him to be as sexist as he was in the cartoon, but they really tried to push the \"I'm in charge\" attitude especially in regards to his relationship with Katara. Sokka's meeting Suki was also really awkward and the rushed pacing of the show didn't help, really doing a disservice to the character.With luck we won't have to see a season 2. At least it was better than the live action movie?","rating":"3\/10","date":"23 February 2024"}
{"title":"Not horrible, had potential, but the acting and dialogue killed it","review":"Ugh... Effects were great, fighting scenes were really well done, however, after the first episode, I knew this show just wasn't going to reach the caliber that it had the potential of reaching.I could forgive some of the additions , and even some of the slight changes to the plot, but the acting is so flat , it's hard to really tell a story like ATLA.The score could have been great too , but it felt like I was watching a CW show ( and those shows are fun and entertaining, but we know they aren't up there in quality).As for the dialogue, there were sooo many unessecery scenes where the characters talk to themselves, it felt forced and unatural. I think they had to do this because the acting is just not good enough for them to be able to convey what they need to convey with just actions, they had to resort to the characters literally telling us what they are thinking.At the end of the day, it's not a horrible show, they tried, but I'm not gonna watch it when I am aware of the great source material that is out there.This show falls flat.","rating":"5\/10","date":"25 February 2024"}
{"title":"Its just sort of boring","review":"I enjoy how this does a fairly good job of following the original plot, but theres so many things i just feel are unnecessary that have been added in, and thr timeline is kinda weird. I get that this has to be a little more rushed but some events are just sort of mashed together.My biggest problem is with the characters. They're just so plain and just lack personality. Like sokka, i read somewhere that his Sexism was weird, but wasn't that the point?? Its not like it went un acknowled and it a big part of hia character development. Or azula, before she was extremely confident in herself and actually very clever, but now shes lost a lot of that and just doesn't feel like the same character at all. And katara just has no personality whatsoever wich is just so annoying. Honestly the only character that seems to have kept their person is zuko.","rating":"5\/10","date":"9 March 2024"}
{"title":"It's not good...","review":"It's not good, despite the fact that I really wanted it to be. Here's just some issues I had:1. Expanding the ATLA world was a cheap ploy to add substance\nIt hasn't figured out its relationship with the original series, and I really feel that lostness in the show. It tried to \"fill in\" gaps from the original show like showing the Air Nomads pre-genocide, but this only led to more lack of direction and took away the plot focus and clarity that the original show had. Adding these gaps would've been a good idea to add to the worldbuilding, but clarifying the story and the purpose of their events comes first. Otherwise, it's a cheap ploy to make it feel like the story has more substance.2. Lack of understanding darkness\nThe original show was already dark. It was filled with heavy themes of emotional weight that addressed war, genocide, identity, friendship, and good vs evil. This remake however thought that gore, violence, and making complex characters unfair (like Kyoshi who was already cruel but in a fair way) would make the show darker and fit the studio's audience goals. It doesn't. It just lowers the quality of the characters, instead of treating them with integrity by removing their sense of class through crudeness and unjust cruelty.3. Unable to balance serious tone with brevity\nThe original show's writing, with dialogue and plot, were concise, impactful, and sincere. I feel like this remake tried to distinguish itself as maybe Shakespearean with internal transparency by having long monologues, but this was agonizing to watch because this isn't realistic. There are other ways to portray internal conflicts that are more intelligent and relatable. The \"expert\" Hollywood studios can figure this out.Overall, horrible intervention from greedy Hollywood execs. I can see it as someone who works in the industry. There were probably a million hands on this who all wanted to leave their own mark, but this mass collection of selfish goals led to the show's failure with lack of cohesion, identity, and quality.","rating":"3\/10","date":"6 May 2024"}
{"title":"Only a pale shadow compared the the fantastic original!","review":"NETFLIX's Avatar: The Last Airbender ist but a pale shadow in comparrison to the fantastic animated show of the early 2000s. They try to cram all the emotional moments of the entire animated show in season one on Netflix.To make one big example: We all know the powefull episode \"Tales from Ba Singh Se\" in season three that finishes with the stunning 'Leaves From The Vine' moment where uncle Iroh's backstory is fianlly beeing revealed. For two seasons the viewer was made to beleave that Iroh is just a weird old fool but revealing the tragic death of his son during the first siege of Ba Singh Se is what tunred him from a tough general, a man of war, into a the wise mentor who had enough of fighting.It were moments like this that made the original show great. It was a great display on how well written all these characters were.In the Netflix show however, all these moments are all laid out for you and shoved right into your face. It is not a journy where the viewer discovers things. It feels more like a strawl through fields of member-berries:\n\"MEMEBA IROH? MEMEBA HOW SAD HE WAS?\"\nHe does not even sing the song, instead it is just the melody from Leaves From The Vine played via orchestra in the backround.All this makes the whole relveal so much less effective! Granted I shed a tear watching this, but only because of how powerfull the original was and how THAT made me feel.Can't rate this show higher than 5\/10. At least the costumes are quite good and some of the casting fits a lot better than in the terrible movie adaptation.I recommend watching the origianl instead.","rating":"5\/10","date":"24 February 2024"}
{"title":"It gets a 5 for the concept","review":"I only ever watched a few episodes of the animated series and it kinda bored me. This being live action I thought I'd give it a bash.Might have been a mistake. I'm only a couple of episodes in and, although I do like the overall idea of the story, I can't figure out if it's trying to be serious or slapstick? The acting is gosh-darn awful, like a school drama production. I'm yet to find one character that seems genuine.The idea itself should be deep and meaningful, with great mystical powers of good vs evil. But what we end up with is wooden acting, forced humour (I think it's meant to be humour anyway) and a longing for something better.Maybe the animated show got it across better, I probably won't find out as animations of that style just don't hold me. Such a shame as the imagery is actually pretty good. Not the best I've ever seen but certainly passable.I give it 5 stars just because of the storyline idea. The execution of it... Maybe 3 stars.","rating":"5\/10","date":"1 April 2024"}
{"title":"Tell Not Show, Unnecessary Changes and Motivation to Rewatch the Original","review":"This show thinks you are dumb. The show takes a preference to conversation instead of character interactions to flesh out the cast. One example being Aang, and him being more powerful\/different than the other airbenders in his tribe. We are not shown this. We easily could've had 5 minutes dedicated to him (like in the animated series) trying to play with others, only to take it too far or win to easily.Sozins comet. The fire benders feel brutal, but the comet doesn't. The fire lord feels brutal, but not because of the comet. Easy fix, make the fire nation attacking a slaughter like it needed to. Make the fire ridiculously bright and raging. Make us afraid for the cast, afraid of the comet and its power boost. Show someone bending fire walls and scorching the earth to really make it clear how awful the actual ethnic cleansing that took place was.Another thing is Sokkas sexism. It isn't just there for laughs, we laugh at how ridiculous he is, and begin to love him when he learns from his mistakes and ultimately celebrates female strength. Also, making Suki shy and nervous around Sokka sets back the well rounded, strong female character she was in the animated show. She didn't need sokka, but fell for him when his compassion began to shine through his bigotry.","rating":"4\/10","date":"24 February 2024"}
{"title":"I still want them to complete the series.","review":"I am a long time fan of the original series and I have watched ATLA and TLOK multiple times. The original series is one of the best tv shows of all time, imho. I was very excited when the live action was announced but waited to watch until the whole season was out. I have to admit that I was quite shocked by the 7.4 stars that it got on the imdb, which is quite low for the remake of such a highly rated show. Unbothered by that score I still wanted to form my own opinions and I am proud to inform you that I have watched the complete series and here are my thought.The first thing that came to my mind was that they had to condense 20 episodes worth of material in just 8 episodes so there are bound to be some changes. But then I realised that the original series had episodes around 22-23 minutes and if you remove the credits you can average out each episode at 20 minutes. That means 20 episodes of 20 minute content add up to 6 hours and 40 minutes. While the remake has eight, one hour long episodes with about 10 minutes of credits. That means eight episodes with 50 minutes of content also add upto 6 hours and 40 minutes exactly. Which means if the makers of the show wanted to remake the show as it was, they had enough runtime to do so.The one thing that irks me the most with the remakes is when the writers try to dumb down the story so to help the masses understand it better. It felt like I was watching a history documentary instead of a tv show. Everything was laid out bare in front of the audience with the help of narration.I also want to talk about the characters. Sokka was originally the sarcasm and meat guy. I am sad to inform that Sokka is not the sarcasm guy anymore. Sokka is souless npc now. Aang was the fun loving lively boy but now all fun is gone from him. His character is overly understanding and serious. It felt so weird watching him that I cant even put it into words. Zuko's character was somewhat similar but there was a lot less angst and almost no talk about honor and destiny. He even sat down to listen to Aang's monologue for a couple of minutes and when he finally attacks Aang after blue spirit it felt forced. The writers tried to justify Zuko's behaiour by portraying him as a naive boy who didn't know what fire nation was doing and his driving force is shown to be goodness of character and he truly believes that the firelord is correct. But in the original Zuko was driven by his desire to regain his honor and reclaim his destiny as the firelord. Uncle Iroh is almost ok but he cries so much in this remake that I don't know if the \"Leaves from the vine\" moment is gonna hit its mark at all.The writers dedicated a lot more time to Sokka's romantic adventures than the original show. Especially a lot of plot points were sacrificed to increase the screen time of Sokka and Yue together. In the original show the gang were all kids with Aang 12yo, Katara 14 and Sokka at 15 yo. Now the whole cast is almost 20+ yo. This is a strange choice since the success of stranger things proved that child actors can act as well as any adults.The best thing in the whole show was when Avatar Kyoshi unleashed hell on Commander Zhao on the Kyoshi island. That was some hot stuff and got me pumped for the whole series but sadly the whole season went downwards after that point. I have to say that the CGI was top notch. I would watch the whole series just to see how the cgi will look in different scenes but considering how the writers treated this season many good scenes might be removed completely again. I was waiting for when Aang goes to meet Roku on the island but the Roku fight scene never came.In the end I hope that they complete the series and maybe take input from the fans or maybe include the original writer in the writing process as well. Good day to you all.","rating":"5\/10","date":"4 March 2024"}
{"title":"Idk man...","review":"I absolutely ADORE the animated series! It was beautiful and emotional and had amazing pacing. We see each character develop and grow.This series rushes everything. It's hard to even keep up because there were so many unnecessary changes to the original story. I'm over here scratching my head. You cannot connect with any of the characters because of the horrible pacing. Also there is absolutely no growth for Aang from what I see so far. He comes out of the ice a \"warrior\" rather than the child he's supposed to be. Considering he's the main character and the actors seem to be attempting to do the best they can with this rewrite of the story, well we can already see how much this show is failing. Hopefully it doesn't continue to deteriorate.","rating":"5\/10","date":"27 February 2024"}
{"title":"Air bender breezes by good writing and dialogue","review":"The last air bender has a couple good things going for it which are the CGI, the sets and the costume designer. That said, these qualities do not make up for the lack of good writing. The acting is also not great which is not surprising because they build off each other. However, maybe this was for children and maybe it was written by children. In that case i take back my critique. If not, the lack of good dialogue takes away all depth that the wonderful story has to offer. It is mind blowing that this is what was delivered. Thus this falls flat and the last air bender sucked all the wind from the shows sails.","rating":"5\/10","date":"26 February 2024"}
{"title":"Mwah","review":"First of lets start by saying that you could better watch the animated series if you want to experience avatar as it should be experiences. This feels like a weird nockoff from wish or whatever.As many people have already said before me the acting is not great, i cannot call it bad and it gets progressively better, episode two was horrible and Aang and Sokka are the main culprits here. In the later episodes it feels like it gets a bit better. I think the reason for the bad acting is a combination of the lines being too unnatural and exposition heavy and young actors acting almost completely in a studio infront of a greenscreen. It apparently creates for a very unnatural feel to the acting and line deliveries.It's not all negative, for a live action series I think the CGI that was used was good especially Momo and Appa looked very good. Same goes for the bending and the fight choreography that went hand in hand with this.I have also read some complaint about the costumes, that they looked too clean and felt like cheap cosplay, this I do not really agree with. It does feel too clean some times but I don't think the cheap cosplay look is justified, it just looks weird because it's accurate with the animated series, this is especially evident with Bumi.I think that the music was done very well and they were able to convey the feeling the animated series really well.So let's look at the story, this is where I have mixed feelings. While watching it I tried to separate this series from the animated one but it was too hard for me. From changes to the character of Aang, to change of other characters and the plot. The series felt too serious and Aang not as Aang. I get that some changes needed to be made but it felt forced and not thought through enough\nCharacter casting was also mixed with Aang, Katara, Sokka, Zuko and Suki great but Azula and her gang terrible.","rating":"4\/10","date":"11 April 2024"}
{"title":"Closer to the movie than the original","review":"Im a huge fan of the original series and consider it one of the best shows ever written, and that makes me go back to rewatch it once a year. That also made me wait for this show for the last 5 years since netflix teased us with this adaptation.With everything being said about the original i knew it was an extremely high bar to set for this adaptation. Many things gave me pessimistic eyes on this show after more information came out, and after hearing the original creators left after the first episode, i knew there would be a lot of changes. So i really tried to give myself into that it wouldn't be a 1 to 1 copy just to not let any negative ruin my watch.After watching the first 3 episodes my patience we're caught up. They people behind this show have completely changed, rushed and mashed everything together. It seems they didn't understand at all what made the original so great. The characters and their character arc is so rushed that it all seems so insignificant and boring. The show although having good effects, is just a tough watch if you are coming from the original. It leaves you with no emotion for either the story or the characters.Where is the world building? Where is the creativity to tackle complexed topics? And where is the humour that leaves a joy in the audience? All these things were something that made the original great. A core of a concept to letting the characters exist as they are and choose who not they were meant to be , but who they want to be.I only watched this adaptation for the sake of my love for the original. Very disappointed and a hard watch to get trough.","rating":"5\/10","date":"25 February 2024"}
{"title":"Visually great, but...","review":"... the story is very disappointing.If you watch this expecting the story to be like the story of the cartoon, you'll be sorely disappointed. I think if you know little to nothing about the cartoon you will find this show highly enjoyable. Unnecessary liberties were taken; storylines merged, characters were substituted, replaced or omitted altogether, and most of the story is told out of order.The actors are obviously, for the most part, very green and were chosen for aesthetics (meaning they look VERY much like the cartoon characters) and for not talent. With one notable exception, Uncle Iroh. Not only does he honor Mako by the way he portrays the character, he clearly has the chops to blend his take on Iroh seamlessly with the character Mako created.","rating":"5\/10","date":"6 March 2024"}
{"title":"Update: I first dropped, then continued. Still not good.","review":"Updated review:I'm glad I stuck with it, I thought episode 1 was by far the worst episode. But the rest of the show was either lukewarm or bad for me.Trying to look at this on its own merits, I did not really buy the connections made with team avatar. Hell, I didn't really like any of the main characters in general. I found this Aang annoying with him always reasserting his mission and how useless he is. Katara was just... plain? Nothing really to say about her, not a lot of personality. Sokka was stupid, but not really the charming kind.In addition, Zuko and Iroh were alright, but both of their arcs felt so rushed through this season. Azula was super whiny and desperate, I didn't like her at all.Most of the season just felt fast and I didn't really buy the development of the characters.Great visuals and fight choreography. They went all out there and they deserve the credit. Costumes were all on point.But the story was just badly executed and the dialog left a lot to be desired. The cast were good picks, but I think they were just handed a bad script. Overall, this is a 4\/10 for me.Old review:\nI couldn't make it passed the first episode. Everything is off about this show. I actually rewatched the first three episodes of the original to rejog my memories and it's amazing what the animation accomplished with so much less.I think the core of the issue is that the writers didn't really understand the original vision. They thought their vision was better which was misguided. The way the show is structured, the changed arcs, and the tone are just all off. And because of that, everything else has ripple effects: the comedy, dialogue, and acting all suffer because of directional choices that are mind boggling.Don't waste your time with this show. It does not understand what made the original Avatar great.Here are more of my detailed thoughts:ConsRight off the bat it started unfocused with being in the past and taking too long to get to the present.The intro was.... uuuuuuh? How could you screw up the classic intro.Katara doesn't even know know the basics of water bending and Aang has to give her tips??? How the hell is she supposed to teach him??Granny apparently knows all the answers now even though in the original the southern water tribe only had limited information on what happened to the avatar and the wind benders. Katara and Sokka when they first arrive to the southern wind temple start to figure out what happened and are afraid to tell Aang the truth. But all of that was robbed via Granny spilling all the beans. No build up to that reveal. This is why it was a mistake to show that flashback right off the bat.We also lost the cool scene where all the nations get notified of the Avatar returning (maybe that's next episode idk).Gyasto got bodied by the firebenders even though in the original he took out like 10 of them, really unfortunateThe dialog is also bad and does not flow well. It does not capture the humor and delightful tone of the original. The One Piece live action was able to capture the humor of the manga and add its own flair, so going to this is just rough man. They weren't able to capture any of the original tone and even in the serious moments it follows below the emotional moments in the first three episodes of the originalThe acting leaves a lot to be desired as well. I'm just not really buying the performances.Aang and Sokka's no longer have their original arcs. Aang immediately is determined at the end of episode 1 to go save the world which is so off. Aang is just a kid in the original and struggles with his responsibilities, but here he just easily accepts his duty which makes no sense when in the beginning of the episode he was struggling with it. Sokka feels like a hollow version of his original self-all the rough edges are gone.ProsThe best thing was Gyasto and Aang sharing a heartfelt moment in the beginning.The visual look good, I'll give them that.This is an easy drop for me.","rating":"4\/10","date":"23 February 2024"}

I personally don't think this show needs a sequel because the acting it's pretty low and if the producer didn't realise that in more than 2 episodes it's just not worth it. To bad for the screenplay and the story because they looked really solid and could've been something special but as a movie critic I say this shoul be put on a long forgotten shelf until someone capable understands the morale of the story.","rating":"3\/10","date":"29 March 2024"}
{"title":"It's the spoon feeding","review":"I will never understand why show writers and directors feel this need to blandly spoon feed audiences. It was such a popular show because of the story building not the story telling. Instead the use of the narrator ruins basically every major plot and mystery, Aang's character arc and training out the window (probably because they want to expand to more than 3 seasons cause $$$$ not artistry), Bumi's character completely intolerable, zero romance or connection between Aang and Katara, Katara's bending is just unbelievable and not in a great way, in the way that pulls the viewer from the world being built.I'm just saying it must've been years since anyone involved was just a regular TV viewer or they wouldn't have released this. At least it's not as bad as the movie that shall not be named. But not all that watchable either, just watch the anime if you're looking for the perfect show.","rating":"5\/10","date":"26 March 2024"}
{"title":"Much difference","review":"I don't really give it -0 because it's not possible.I have always understood that these series\/movies change a little from the original but... this is brutally absurd. Many, too many things have changed. Where is Ang's effort to learn waterbending? Since when is Soka completely useless? The princess of the ice tribe was not a waterbender. That is, small details that seem insignificant but totally change the story and perception of it.How disappointing. Not to mention Mae, Azula, ozai... totally out of place. But not everything is bad... THE ANIMATION IS EXCELLENT. If they make a new season. I hope they improve and stick to the animation.","rating":"1\/10","date":"16 March 2024"}
{"title":"Lack luster in acting and writing, luster in visuals and effects","review":"I thought it was pretty awful. Many of the actors were terrible, especially poor Aang who seemed to be emotionally stuck in an equivalent to that scene from the Philosophers stone where Harry says \"I can't be a a a wizard?!\" In part the writer's doing, but he had none of his hyperactivity or longing for the freedom of childhood, instead focusing all of his energy on \"the main quest\" - and this is... Kind of Aang's entire character arc. \u00f0\u0178\u00a4\u201d In fact the re writing had much of the character development left out, with no sincere exploration of any relationships that I noticed. Not to mention the dialogue was so incredibly ham and heavy handed in exposition that I almost couldn't finish the series (stomached my way to the end out of my love for the animated one, but it really did feel like it was a screenplay written by a school child). Granted, the action sequences were decent at times, some of the actors were excellent (Zuko and Sokka), and the world design was very true to the original. Though overall, a no from me. NB: as a minor personal point, I noticed that a number of the benders used incorrect form, which you'd think would be easy to fix given that the bending styles are based off real martial arts. They do get it right mostly, but it seems silly to intermittently fall down on this aspect in what is primarily a world-building show. Overall, some good bits, many poor bits, with the main let down being Aang's acting coming off a little bit like a GCSE drama piece.","rating":"1\/10","date":"17 March 2024"}
{"title":"LOVED THE FX\/ STORY LINE... CHARACTERS MEHH","review":"The story line and visuals are stunning, for a live action it was out of the park. I have never left a review for anything but I had to for this. The characters were questionable they knocked Sokka and Zuko out of the park, Iroh looks like a old monkey king character and Katara was just emotionless and kind of a disappointment to the character, the Katara from the movie version would have been a better fit for this. I do love the new firelord, it was well cast and Azula just isn't working for me\u00f0\u0178\u02dc\u201a. I really do wish we could of seen a better Katara, she is a really important character but as an avatar fan since I was a kid, I will continue to watch and hope to see more seasons, hopefully better ones. I would like to note that the original creators did leave this project so expectations shouldn't be set high on this. I think those of whom watch this with low expectations will find it more enjoyable.","rating":"4\/10","date":"23 February 2024"}
{"title":"An other failure","review":"They made all the wrong decisions. They put a lot of effort in correct costumes and great effects. However, I'ld rather have seen changes in costumes, it would've looked less cheap. The effects were perfect, that deserves at least 3 stars.The dialogue was extremely bad, they didn't give any room for emotions and made sure they said exactly what they felt or did (unrealistic). It might've been the dialogue which messed up the characters as well.I suppose Sokka was oke. Sadly Aang was the worst of them all. They set the character to be in a constant state of seriousness and sadness, though he used to be a happy, goofy kid. They completely missed that.It felt like they tried to fill the whole series with rememberable pleasers, it felt weak and shows a lack of depth.Next to that, they added explanations for things that didn't need explaining in the most obvious way. They gave people characteristics that didn't fit with there character.The acting wasn't great. I feel like that it mostly has to do with the badly written dialogue.Though the CGI looked great and deserved 3 stars. The serie was so badly written that I am changing it to 2 stars.!! NOT WORTH THE WATCH!!","rating":"2\/10","date":"18 March 2024"}
{"title":"Nostalgia Bait","review":"Not everything that glitters is gold.This series suffers from its own predecessor, which wasn't on a \"tight\" budget, was in animated format, existed in a different social context to the contemporary one. It just feels that ATLA has been marvelized (the avatar state is just so awful) and core story points, comedy and character developments are entirely missing from the overall script. Also why was a lot of the Chinese traditional writing removed from the series? The series is based on Far East, SEA and Inuit cultures, but it feels like that grounding history was removed, especially the Tibetan influences of the air nomads.Cinematography has a lot to be desired, they should really look at the color grading and lighting effects from the animation. Many episodes in the animation had an effect which reminds me of Chinese landscape paintings, which was non-existent here. Its like the cinematographers and directors don't understand lighting at all, apart from flat studio lighting, which doesn't do anything for immersion, world building or the actors, CGI, costuming and makeup.CGI has a lot left to be desired, lightning bending was truly awful.While producers and executive producers still rule over creative direction, screenwriting, directing and the actual content that is seen on screen - we won't be getting a good adaptation anytime soon.Writers room needs a change of faces and the producer ALBERT KIM needs to not touch another script, allow the original creators to return and do justice to ATLA. I hope the actors see this as a learning curb and take it on the chin, they deserve better acting projects and to work with directors and producers that actually understand filmmaking and performance outside of the DCU and MCU.","rating":"4\/10","date":"23 February 2024"}
{"title":"This Show is For Someone Who Has Never Seen ATLA","review":"This show's target audience are die hard Avatar fans, Just like the horrendous movie that was made. I completely understand wanting to make characters your own but in some respect you have to do that in the realm of the character as a whole.I say this because not only was the acting not good but also the tone of each character just felt off. Whenever Zuko was on camera he just looked as if he was going to cry and he was more represented as a Whiny kid. Sokka seemed as if he was a shell of himself with 0 corny jokes. Uncle Iroh just didn't seem like he fit well in the story. Ty Lee and Mae are supposed to be complete opposites but Mae didn't seem all that glum and Ty Lee didn't seem all that Giddy. Azula was introduced perfectly but after that scene it seemed as her character tone did a complete 180. I could continue just in this respect but I feel as if I proved my point.Lastly, the whole story felt very rushed. This can be understood if it was a movie because you're trying to fit everything into 2.5 hours but for this to be not only a series but a series with hour long episodes to still feel rushed is just absurd. Here is an idea, Stop with these 8 episode seasons and maybe go to 12. Make the viewer fall in love with these characters and their stories. Let us experience there journeys together.The only bright spot of this whole series is that we got the \"Secret Tunnel\" song.","rating":"4\/10","date":"23 February 2024"}
{"title":"If only...","review":"If only they were trying less to be original... if only they didn't try to make it different on every little step of the way, but above all: if Aang's actor knew how to act!Main role, Aang ofc, is played by a pretentious little guy who can't even look away from the camera and much less give off real energy and true emotions... he's so lame in pretending to be acting that I see him directly responsible for so bad aftertaste... it's like watching children's teater!Simply, main actor has to be just that - main. This boy is just not even close, and unfortunately for him, he is so posey that he is just a lost cause - he'll never even try to become better at it.","rating":"4\/10","date":"15 May 2024"}
{"title":"Nothing like the animation","review":"Although better than the previous live action remake this show has some serious crimes against the animated version and It makes the show overall a big disappointment. Here's a brief list:1. The characters\nSomething went seriously wrong during the script writing and casting phase of this show. Ang who is twelve years old and walks around with a stunned mullet face 90 percent of the time is regularly saying things like \"but I didn't ask for this life\", \"I just want to be normal' etc. Are we seriously meant to believe this 12 year old has this kind of insight? Also the self pity displayed by Ang, Katara and Soka is classic Disney but nothing like the animation. In the animation Ang is a happy and fun boy - sadly this show has made him out to be a confused psychiatrist.2. The weird mishmash of cultures\nThe northern water tribe talk with a Native American accent however has Japanese style gaits in their gardens - it's next level stupid.3. Terrible plausability\nIn one scene you see about 100 fire nation ships lined up to attack then northern water tribe and they have known about the attack for days. Any reasonable person would think \"Oh great they had days to prepare and organise themselves\". Well the normal person would be wrong. 30 minutes before the ships come the water tribe leader says \"oh no they're only 30 minutes away, bring in the scouts we're going to need all the men we can get\" - I mean really? Also when the fire nation is attacking look at the background extra's, they cites being bombarded by fireballs and they are running back and forth doing absolutely nothing. Also the city is under attack right and suddenly a brick falls on momo (a lemur), instead of fighting off the fire nation to save a whole city of people, two main characters suddenly become obsessed with saving the lemur! Like hello it's war, not animal rescue.4. No facial expressions\nKatara takes the medal for this award. Katara's fascial expressions are: blank face, blank face + raised eye brows, open mouth blank face (when water bending), pouted lips with blank face when feeling sorry for herself. Second place goes to Ang who as I mentioned earlier looks confused almost all the time.5. No strength training and barely any martial arts style bending\nHonestly this a repeat of Rey from Star Wars. Katara who starts off being able to barely move a bowl of water suddenly is on par with a master bender from the northern water tribe with literally no training. Also when she bends it looks more like magic than martial arts which is how it looks in the animation. She just waves her arms and the water flys around. Also she doesn't move her feet at all - in the animation she does Tai Chi movements, in this show she arm waving.There's so much more wrong with the show but I'm done typing for now. Don't bother watching it if you enjoyed the animation, they have made this live action with the intellectual ability of a 10 year old.","rating":"2\/10","date":"28 February 2024"}
{"title":"Disappointed but appreciative of the good","review":"I first watched the animated series as an adult, after hearing about it through an online review. I was blown away by it and how it perfectly mixed childish humor and basic life lessons with bigger, adult themes. I was optimistic when I heard that a live version was being made, as I felt that the Airbender world offered more to be explored, in depth. The first bad sign was the departure of the two creators.The positives: The costumes and visuals are great, overall. I do think some time should have been put into making the costumes look a little more lived in, but that's not a major problem for me. It's obvious that a lot of hard work went into this series on the technical side.The negatives: The first big one is the story pacing; too much is crammed into each episode. If 8 episodes was a must for Netflix, then they should have focused on fewer storylines. I don't have a problem with the Firenation being a big part of season 1, which differs from the show, but it gave the audience less time with the central characters and rushed everything. I think most of the actors and their acting suffered as a result and they often seem stiff. There is too much expositing and not enough showing.Watching the show makes me wonder if Netflix thought that the\nanimated show was just a popular kids show and not the all age encompassing phenom that it is. I'd like to think that the showrunners can adapt to the criticism and improve on Season 2, but Netflix's history with animated adaptations leaves me pessimistic.","rating":"5\/10","date":"8 April 2024"}
{"title":"Surprisingly high rating for this","review":"I'm surprised to see the rating around 7.5, I'm guessing many of voters haven't seen the original - since the two aren't really comparable in IMO.I loooove the original cartoon version, and even just the voices and melodies of the characters were so much more genuine and fun!I would give a higher rating to the original WITHOUT video (as an audiobook) than this. Cause it's so much fun, even though it's deep at times.Also since the acting is quite off in this one, especially when it comes to Aang - it's b-level acting, where his \"surprised face\" always looks like he's not really surprised.My second favorite character Uncle Iroh, who in the original version feels kind of enlightened and free, is here just an ordinary old man white some half-assed advice but also some fakey expressions making him feel less sympathetic and liberated.Also I believe they skipped out on some nice parts as well for no apparent reason. For instance Aang seeing Kataras face when he wakes up and being all gooey...Effects and such: great of course, but watch the original first and then see what you think about this!","rating":"5\/10","date":"23 March 2024"}
{"title":"Terrible adaptation","review":"So very sad. The last air bender has once again been dragged in the mud. This adaptation lacks everything the original does. The storyline is boring and the very best parts from the original series has been erased or changed for the worst. The only impressive part is the bending effects. Sometimes looking fake, but in general really nice.Ofc you can't expect an Oscar worthy performance from child actors, but this... unfortunately aangs performance was very flat and forced. The same goes for Katara where the writers made her entirely emotionless.It would be very interesting to see another season though.","rating":"3\/10","date":"23 February 2024"}
{"title":"Why change so much?","review":"Gran Gran tells Aang in Wolf Cove that the Air Nomads in the Southern Air Temple are dead... then they go anyway so he can see the dead monks. He's supposed to go to the temple thinking he's gonna see his old friends, forgetting that it's been 100 years. This is important for remembering he's just an innocent kid and not a hero yet.They go to Kyoshi island to learn from the statue of Kyoshi, not to ride the giant koi. There's no penguin sledding. Suki comes on really strong to Sokka and it's kind of weird. Then Aang gets.. possessed? By Kyoshi when the fire nation invades the island.. or something. It was really out thereThere's no personality in Appa, just a fat ugly vehicle in this show. Momo is only shown when he's stealing food from Sokka which is supposed to be funny but just isn't.They destroyed the Omashu storyline. They mashed up Omashu, Northern Air Temple with Teo and Sai, Jet and the Freedom Fighters, and Secret Tunnel of Love. They all happened in the same setting in the same episode. How more rushed can you make it?They destroyed the character of Bumi. When Bumi throws Aang a feast, Katara and Sokka are not present. But you know who is present? Like 20 random people around the dinner table fake laughing at Bumi's bad jokes. Because Sokka was busy dealing with Teo and Sai and Katara was busy dealing with Jet while Aang was at dinner with Bumi. They split up the characters when the essence of the show is having them be together no matter what.Bumi fights Aang AFTER revealing himself as Bumi. Why? Because THIS Bumi BLAMES Aang for letting the war happen, and he's fighting him out of anger and spite instead of just messing with him. There's no Sokka and Katara in creeping crystals, I.e, no incentive for Aang to fight. He didn't HAVE to fight Bumi, but he did. Which the real Aang wouldn't do.I stopped there, at episode 4, because I couldn't continue watching arbitrary changes and random fabrications that subtract severely from what we're meant to love about the universe of ATLA. I don't even mind that the acting isn't good, I just wanted the story. Netflix had THE SHOW WRITTEN FOR THEM!!!! There was no need to change anything but they stuck their grubby hands onto something golden and somehow managed to turn it to dirt. Once again.The only reason it isn't a 1\/10 is because the kid actors really did try. And I think with a better studio they could have done justice to the characters. But Netflix corrupted and bastardized their performances to twist the characters they're supposed to be portraying into unrecognizable, half baked iterations that do things they would NEVER do. I don't get how you fumble something that's written for you already with a budget this big. But, I'm not devastated because we still have the og. Which is probably the only ATLA that was ever meant to exist.","rating":"5\/10","date":"23 February 2024"}
{"title":"Zuko and Iroh are the saviors","review":"I was really hyped about the Live-Action-Series of Avatar, because the Original is one of the best Animations Series ever. And After 6 Episodes I am not convinced.First of all, in direct comparison with the Movie in 2010, this Series is and can only be better. There is no downgrade possible after Shyamalan.And yes, this Netflix Series ist visually alright and the bending looks good. The characters are overall matching with the original characters. Especially Ozai and Zuko. And yeah props to the directors that they took Asian people for the Series. And I believe that people are gonna enjoy the journey of Aang in this adaption.But for the true fans there is so much not acceptable.Let's start with some characters. Aang. The young actor really fits to the original. He is very young, so no front against his skills in acting, but they could be better. More important is, why is Aang, from the beginning, the wisest human in the Series?? He is supposed to be goofy, young and has much to learn. It is his character development in the whole Series to say at the end that the worlds fate is his responsibility as the Avatar. The Netflix Series does Not give him any chance to grow and develop himself. It is kind of annoying to hear in nearly every sentence of him that he is the Avatar and he has to do it.Next character. Azula. Why does she has to be the victim in the beginning? That we have compassion with her right away? Azula is evil! We get to know her issues in the third book and not that early.Sokka. Unfortunately they also took him the chance to develop himself about his sexism.Overall this adaption has not the original humor. I barely laughed while watching.Why I continued this Series is because of the storyline of Zuko and his uncle Iroh. Just lovely to watch. Definitely the best character! And also the best acting. Zuko is not an easy role to play.And I have a big Problem with storyline itself. I know that they can not completely stick to the original. But why do they have to bring things up of the second book in the first season? There is a difference of letting out some parts and making a mess with the timeline. No words for that.No wonder, that the creators left the cooperation.But hey the creatures are really nice. Maybe the whole focus is in that?","rating":"4\/10","date":"26 February 2024"}

But the acting seldom rises above that of your local community theatre group - in fact at times my local community group does a lot better than the actors in this series. And thus the overall rating is \"5\", because the acting is definitely a \"0\".Of course it is to be expected when the opening credits say Netflix and Nickelodeon ... but as Nickelodeon has very little concept of acting it is not very surprising.So many of today's series are sacrificing acting for visual effects.

{"title":"Killed the original story","review":"The CGI WAS REALLY GOOD. That's about the only positive things to say about this series. The lines are terrible (you have to see it to understand how bad it is) and make no sense, figurine is cringy, the charachters and their possible development were butchered. Most cast choices were also very poor. And the things they adapted basically change how all bending works, specially relating to the avatar state. Kitara starts bending out of the blue BC she simply can, on ep ONE. It's another one down the drain BC the could not follow the original authors intended guidance... It's sad BC the Last airbender is a REALLY short series already, there was no need to adapt that much to fit the media, it was done out of spite. All we wanted was the original with good cgi. But all we got was fanfiction again. Thanks a lot Netflix. Look forward to the day more authors stand up to Netflix like Eiichiro Oda, otherwise they'll kill your IP 100% of the time.","rating":"4\/10","date":"25 February 2024"}
{"title":"Impossible to live up to the Original","review":"If you are going to remake The last air bender then you have to be a fan of the original show. If you are a fan of the original show then you know that it was already a perfect show. It's not just \"a really good show for kids,\" it's a masterpiece that can't be touched (maybe there's some room for improvement with \"the divide\"). If you remake the show and it's not a 1-1 retelling then you are doomed from the start because it's not a fan making it. A fan knows that they can't make it any better. In this remake that shows. The story jumps from story beat to story beat with no life or charm to it. Most of the dialogue feels like filler and has no real meaning other than getting from point A to point B. It's like the creators knew things about the show that fans liked, but didn't understand why they were great to begin with. Changing why, when, and how things happen changes the reason why we love the show. In order to save time 3-4 episodes at a time were mashed together. Suddenly the team is split up where they weren't in the original, events are happening out of order, and you have to drop any sort of character development just to move the story to where it needs to go. When you do that, you lose all the little details and character growth that makes The last air bender great. The effects are okay and so are the stunts, but the entire world is CGI and it feels like there's not a real set in the whole show. After this remake I don't believe this show should be touched without DiMartino and Konietzko involved.","rating":"5\/10","date":"23 February 2024"}
{"title":"Poor writing only partially offset by stellar visuals...","review":"Not sure where the supposed $20+ Million\/episode went but I know none of it went to the writing room. If it wasn't for the source material and overall story being as good as it is, this adaptation would have been a complete failure. In Netflix's adaptation the characters we all know and love have become nothing more than two dimensional echos of their original selves, a fact that is only enhanced by the lackluster performances by the majority of cast members. Fundamental failures in direction, writing, and acting lead me to give this a total 5\/10 review.A single bright spot in this sea of mediocrity would have to be the genuinely awe inspiring visuals, which throughout the series do just enough to keep you from turning the TV off.Knowing full well this would differ from the near perfect original animated series, this review is far from as harsh as it could have been. At the end of the day however, this remake seems to be nothing more than another shameless cash grab rather than the impactful, compelling, artistic update this story truly deserves.","rating":"5\/10","date":"25 February 2024"}
{"title":"Some forced conversations were a big no for me","review":"It's a great series, visuals, story all included. But there are clear desperate attempts to please a certain group of audience. There are scenes so undriven that you start to ask yourself.\"Is this series supposed to be a story of Avatar or are they trying to teach us something desperately?\" or \"Was that necessary?\"I will not mention any scenes, but dialogues of Katara and Sokka sometimes seem enforced, compromising the natural flow of the story. You will notice it subconsciously, that's how out of the book they are.Overall its a good series with great potential, may be next time instead of enforcing something, writers can focus on natural flow of the story.","rating":"5\/10","date":"18 March 2024"}
{"title":"2 stars for special effects","review":"+ 1 star for dallas liu as zuko. I made an account just to share how godawful this show is. I genuinely dont understand how they could mess up a show that already have a perfect blueprint.Characters:\nEven if the actress for katara could act, which she cant, the dialogue shes given has 0 emotion. Her problems stem from being seen as childish compared to sokka, a complete opposite of the original show. Sokka himself is just sad, with some one-liners that fall flat more often than not and no character arc of unlearning his sexist beliefs. Aang is probably the worst of the trio. He's not childish at all, and instead insists at least 3 times every episode that he's the avatar and has so much responsibility. He doesnt support katara when she fights against pakku, which i think is the most blatant example of how bad they wrote him. They made azula an obnoxious, jealous, insecure, and emotional younger sister, who sees zuko as competition and has to \"prove\" herself to ozai. Im nitpicking with these, but gran-gran having insane random knowledge of everything + zhao's increased importance are just strange. Also, yue's wig sucks.Plot:\nI don't inherently hate plot changes in live actions, but the changes they made have no purpose. Why did kyoshi possess aang and save the island all on her own? Why didnt aang and katara learn waterbending on their way to the north pole? Actually, why didnt aang learn waterbending at all? For god's sake, they could've at least gone penguin sledding.I am not a live action hater at all. I really enjoyed percy jackson and one piece, but I was most looking forward to this and it was a gigantic disappointment. Like I mentioned at the start, Dallas Liu is really good as zuko. He got the explosive personality down in a way that didnt look cringe, and I liked the exploration of his past in the episode with the blue mask. Also, appa looks dope.","rating":"3\/10","date":"17 March 2024"}
{"title":"Okay Not Great","review":"For fans of the show, this live action adaption is leaps and bounds better than the Cowboy Bebop attempt but not as good as One Piece. The avatar live action remake sits around a 5 for me. It does not deserve a 1, nor nor does it deserve a 10. I am sick of the review bombing at both ends of the spectrum.To highlight the good: the special effects especially the various element bending is very good. It's great to see cgi used well, and the fire bending especially looks very real. I will say the worst cgi I've seen is Appa the flying bison, but it is nowhere as bad as current MCU status. The environments\/sets and costumes also look very good. Everyone more or less looks their part, with the Kyoshi warriors in particular looking amazing. The acting is also very good and no one feels forced or phoned in. Saka, Ang, and Zuko are without a doubt the best acted characters in the show.As for the bad: well it's everything else aka the story and dialogue. That does not mean the show is by any means terrible. It's just there is A LOT of exposition in this show particularly by the grandma in the first few episodes. Likewise the show went for a more adult theme (as the creators say) which I personally don't mind. However I am not seeing anything remotely adult as this show is TV-PG. Instead they simply cut out a lot of the humor. Again I wouldn't mind if they tried to make the show actually darker and more violent (which they don't do). But when the occasional humor does show up, it's hit or miss and when it missed it's downright cringe. Unle Iroh in particular was my favorite character in the cartoon, but in tisk version he's very awkward because the show doesn't display humor well. When he tries to be funny or quirky, it doesn't evoke the same laughs as the original animation did.Another big down side is a lot of stuff is rushed, losing a lot of the character development and emotional weight of the show. For instance, Saka is no longer sexist which was a huge character flaw he had in the cartoon where he ultimately learned to overcome this. The show runners said they deliberately took this feature away from Saka as they felt modern audiences couldn't handle that. So to translate, 20 years ago when we were all kids, we were somehow mature enough to handle Saka being sexist and learning overtime to respect women especially as warriors, but now that we are all adults we can't handle this theme especially when this show is being \"remade for adult audiences\"? Please someone make it make sense for me.I could go on but this review is long enough. Ultimately if you're a fan of the animated show, you will love the environments, effects\/bending, and costumes being translated to real life but disappointed with how much of the story and character development got cut. If you've never seen the show, you will also think the show looks good but may find the characters rather boring since the creators were too scared to give them any flaws or weaknesses aka personality. In an effort to make everyone more human, they've made all the characters less human.","rating":"5\/10","date":"25 February 2024"}
{"title":"Depressing","review":"First of all, they have completely jumbled up the story. You can't understand anything! All the events are out of order. For the first few episodes, I was just trying to make sense on the storyline. I would say if you want to even remotely understand this storyline, you have to forget the original.I appreciate that they expanded on some of the major events but at the same time, they over explained everything and left nothing to the imagination and while doing all of that, they didn't include any of the wholesome or humorous moments. It seems like everyone is just depressed and the main characters are just traumatized kids.And while this might be more realistic considering the circumstances the story is set in, the original also had light-hearted moments that showed that they do consider each other family and are comfortable around each other. In this they're having to declare that they are family at every turn. You don't see any actual connection or emotion.The special effects were executed beautifully and the fight scenes were eye-catching. Although, when Aang goes into the avatar state, it looks a bit tacky and unrealistic and sometimes his face looks AI generated. However, I did appreciate the added details to his tattoos. The intricate design made it all the more beautiful.This series does have potential but unfortunately they tampered with the original story too much.","rating":"5\/10","date":"23 February 2024"}
{"title":"THIS SHOW IS ABSOLUTELY TRASH","review":"I could tell you right now what made me so mad about this series. Aang was whining like a baby throughout the whole series whenever he got caught. He was begging and pleading with everybody. I just wanted to get up, go through the TV, and choke the hell out of him. The real Aang in the cartoon was playful and joked around about everything, even when he got captured. Aang would fight back without realizing that he was fighting back, he just rolled with the problems as it came. He was never that scary, they completely destroyed the cartoon version of him. Netflix just doesn't need to touch anything. Especially if they can destroy something this bad to the point that I don't see any way of making this better in the future. Please quit while you can, Netflix.","rating":"1\/10","date":"18 April 2024"}
{"title":"Faded xerox of a beautiful painting","review":"This series is fine. If you've never seen the original, of course you'd find the world intriguing. But, that's because it's taken from an original story with so much thought and passion put into it.If you enjoyed this version, please try the original. The only reason why anyone would defend this one so much is because they don't like animation. This version is objectively mid. Just taking a great series, and drying it out, cutting out good parts, and reducing it to a lesser state.Animation is already stigmatized enough as is. I guarantee, if the original series was live action, people would say this new version is bad. But soo many people see animation as \"baby stuff\" or \"boring simple flat little cartoons\", so they won't even give it a shot.Or they obsess over the actors and follow them on all their social media, because face actors get so much love than voice actors.I could barley get through it. So much exposition! Just telling us everything we need to feel and everything happening on-screen. Poor Katara is reduced to a smiling and nodding girl trope, Sokka lacks an arc, Aang is disconnected and flat. They have more time to add to the plot, yet they instead cut a bunch of stuff and rush them along.The live action format greatly limits it. \"Can't have too many shots of Appa, or too many fight scenes, gotta cut them. Think of our budget!! Let's spend more in order to have less!\"It just feels sad and bland in comparison. Sure, it's better than the movie, what a low bar. It's not better than the OG on an objective level. You can enjoy this subjectively, but do not claim it's well made. If you do, I know you cannot understand the quality of the things you consume.Like hey, I enjoy a mix of great, good, mid, and bad things, but I distinguish between my subjective and objective tastes.All in all, I thought it was mediocre. Some may love it, and that's ok, but I hope they understand it isn't well made. And I implore them to try the original animated series, if they love this show, there isn't much reason they wouldn't at least like the original. (unless your one of those live action snobs)\nThis is another to add to the pile of \"unnecessary live action remakes made to make money by making a worse version of something great\"Zuko: \"That...wasn't a good play.\"\nAang: \"I'll say.\"\nKatara: \"No Kidding.\"\nSuki: \"Horrible.\"\nToph: \"You said it.\"\nSokka: \"But the effects were decent.\"","rating":"4\/10","date":"22 May 2024"}
{"title":"Way below expectations","review":"As a childhood fan of Avatar: The Last Airbender definitely this series was something I was looking forward to. The OG animated show if you watch it first it'll look like a regular children's show but once you understand the layers and character arcs you'd know it's not your regular children's show but much more nuanced and layered in its approach, kids can enjoy it but adults can understand it even better. The crisped storytelling, the beautiful world build up, nuanced character arcs and beautiful life lessons for a mid 2000s show was too good for any regular cartoon or even a regular anime. Sure it does have some fillers and comedic moments, but they're good to watch including the silliness. Definitely the M Night Shyamalan live action film was outright disaster and shouldn't even be mentioned which is why I had some scepticisms from Netflix adaptation. And finally the trailer was out and boom, it turned out to be far better than Shyamalan's trash and pretty closer to the OG show hence expectations skyrocketed in positive way till the episodes came out and I was disappointed. Was it better than Shyamalan's trash? ANYDAY BY A MILE! Was it anywhere close to being as good as the OG? NOT BY A MILE!The story this time has taken too many liberties and changed too much from the actual plot, some of it even killing the impact the original show created. The first episode itself was culmination of first 3 episodes of Nickelodeon one and pretty much killed most of the comic moments; Aang and Katara's equation seemed forced; Sokka's sexism trait was removed due to obvious fear of stupid backlash without realising he's gonna turn better by the end; Aang's escape from the ship was turned into a cowardly act and above all biggest disappointment, the Avatar State impact! Remember in OG one when Aang went to Avatar state due to the anger and emotions, it was terribly watered down here. In the animated one entire world was made aware of Avatar's return, here what happens? NOTHING! And one more question, why did they have to show the Fire Lord Sozin's attack so soon in the show? And why change Aang actually running away to make it look like he was just out for a ride? Aang running away because of responsibility was understandable because he was just a 12 year old kid and in the show it shows how Aang is vulnerable and trying to take bigger responsibility at such a small age!If that wasn't enough wait for the forthcoming episodes. While the second episode spent unnecessarily entire hour in Kyoshi Island in which they could've dealt with many other things, the third episode changes the entire story arc and where things are going. Actually in second episode itself why Aang, Katara and Sokka have to go to Northern Water Tribes was shockingly more worse than the OG, OG one needed Aang to learn waterbending as well, here they simply just talked about impending doom being the reason, why? If that's not enough, wait till 3rd and 4th episodes in Omashu where you suddenly find Jet and Mechanist clashing with one another and Team Avatar getting entangled between them, including the Oma Shu caves and the badger mole, turned Aang-Katara love and kiss into Katara-Sokka sibling love fine thats okay. But unnecessarily Aang vs Zuko fight in Omashu in which Zuko is getting better off Aang whereas in the OG it was Aang getting better off Zuko! And Bumi, why make Bumi a sad angry old man while Bumi was so much wise and understandable yet equally eccentric and prankster! In OG Aang realising Bumi was the king was so heartfelt with Bumi imparting his lesson to Aang while in the live action Bumi is angered and unnecessarily behaves indifferent towards Aang till he gets a lesson, like seriously? And why just ruin Jet's arc so terribly? In the show Katara-Jet equation and how Sokka was being useful worked so well, why here ruin it? And then comes episode 5 and 6 where gain multiple story arcs collided, especially bringing Wan Shi Tong so soon instead of library! And Koh who should've appeared in last episode for not showing emotions, so soon? It was good to see Gyatso again but why repeat all what happened with Sokka and Katara all over? Afraid that kids will grow sooner? Fine understandable. And if that's not enough, you had to chop down numerous fillers and get to the point, okay understandable but what about main characters? Why cut down Jeong Jeong who in the OG was literally the one teaching Aang firebending? Or those episodes where Aang accidentally hurt Katara it gave so much arc to Aang and Katara learning how water bending can be used for healing? Brilliant Netflix! And the humor going completely missing! And Aang is supposed to master all 4 elements especially in OG he was learning water bending, what the hell is Aang doing here to learn waterbending? NOTHING! Literally the book 1 was named Water and why isn't Aang learning waterbending?Although there are some positive changes as well, like the entry of Azula, Ozai and Zuko's Agni Kai scenes, Zuko and Iroh's relationship strengthened and Zuko's sacrifice for 41st division of his soldiers gets much better arc, in a positive way. Although I wished many more episodes were needed or many more arcs should've been shown instead of cutting them down. Also return of Cabbage seller, what else was needed? If the Shyamalan's movie was the bar then this is a masterpiece. The vfx, bending, costumes and cinematography was spot on, definitely how an average fan would've expected in live action, perhaps even better!But the other major problem was the cast performances, except Gordon playing Aang, every other actor seemed mediocre and almost expressionless. Paul Sun Hyung Lee was closest Iroh can be in live action, but acting? That's a problem at times. Literally Katara's anger went missing, Sokka was also pretty expressionless unlike its animated counterpart giving too many expressions. And of course the entire show had humour just sprinkled little bit unlike in the OG where humour was present throughout which will make you chuckle.If I rate this show as stand alone show, it is a solid 7\/10 but if compared to OG it's just 3\/10 and compared to Shyamalan's it is 10\/10 so overall rating on my part would be 5\/10. Hopefully he makers fixes the changes in forthcoming seasons and don't get carried away like the Witcher.","rating":"5\/10","date":"25 February 2024"}
{"title":"Not my cup of tea","review":"Okay, I did not like the character changes on the main cast, all of them seemed kinda cringy and boring tbh. I loved some parts, like the bending(especially earth and air), iroh, bumi, and i found momo and appa too be very cute. The story felt rushed and felt like it missed about 8\/9 episodes of information.and the way most of the characters talked seemed very forced and out of place. Wanted too love it, but all I can feel is empty, I feel this was made just too make money and not too make magic on the screen, both for the diehard fans of the animated show and others who maybe wanted too see something new and interesting , so I give it all in all 4\/10.","rating":"4\/10","date":"26 February 2024"}
