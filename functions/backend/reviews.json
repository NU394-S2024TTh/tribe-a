Nickelodeon, known for wacky shows like SpongeBob, Rocko's Modern Life, and sitcoms like Drake and Josh, took a massive step forward with this anime-inspired animated series that delved into deep philosophical themes, genocide, and war.\n\nWhile the concept of elemental power in media isn't new, the show's approach to integrating each element into its own nation, reflecting the psyches and philosophies of the respective element, is truly remarkable.\n\nThe characters are expertly written and performed, with Zuko being my favorite. His incredible progression from villain to antihero to hero is perfectly captured. Aang is a good character, although a bit too much of a goody-two-shoes at times. Katara, Sokka, and Toph are equally appealing characters.\n\nThe show's brilliance lies in its perfect pacing. While there are occasional filler episodes, each one (except The Great Divide) serves a purpose and adds layers to the intriguing story and its world.\n\nIt's impressive how the show incorporates heavy topics while maintaining a silly sense of humor. It's frustrating when people dismiss it as just a 'kids show'. The series can be enjoyed by anyone, regardless of age. It doesn't pander and handles the heavy subject matter in a mature way.\n\nAfter The Legend of Korra, Nickelodeon didn't seem to follow in the footsteps of Avatar, which was disappointing. Kids need more shows like this, to be honest.",

Brilliant story, clever world building that is respectful to the existing world cultures and an extremely satisfying ending. What I really love about the series is it's incredibly diverse set of characters: people of unstained character, those who are pure at heart, although struggling in the ways they act, ones who are on the right side, but achieve their goals by unforgivable means, people who act wrongly, but due to heartbreaking backstories, and finally characters which are simply evil. All in all, one of the greatest masterpieces of all time",

I love how it takes the highlights of cultures and histories around the world and brings them together in a unified story of understanding.

How are you supposed to take this show seriously when the main character is a bald kid with an arrow on his head so that he doesn't forget where his eyes are? He's an \"AiRbEnDeR.\" What does that even mean? He can bend air? If I reach out, and ball my hands into fists, am I technically holding air? If so, then I can move my hands, and bend the air. WOW! Amazing how that works. The villains are a nation of fire people, and yet they have a BOAT? If you can control fire, WHY DO YOU WANT TO BE NEAR WATER? And why does a hurricane defeat the fire nation?

It all really boils down to one thing, which I will talk about in a sec. First all the great stuff about this series: basically everything except the big problem. The problem being when the show goes for episodic adventures and not an over arcing story. The episodic adventures are fine, but it's a little frightening how much better the over arcing story is. Biggest example is episodes 9-11 for me, with them barely being watchable. The worse of this group being the great divide. Also, the characters that they meet during the episodic adventures are way more annoying than in in the other two seasons. Going back to those three episodes, the biggest culprit of this is Jet. Oh My God do I hate Jet! To be fair, the other two seasons I think also have this problem, just not as drastic. If you can look past those things (which I did for the most part), I could argue that this is the greatest American cartoon series ever made. Again, easily the best Nickelodeon series ever made. Go on Netflix and see for yourself!",

      "content": "I am very sorry to not give this 5 stars, but this season just is not quite as good as the other two. Granted, it is amazing and I instantly fell in love with it. The fact that anybody compares seasons 1 and 4 of Korra to this is kind of ridiculous to me. Let's begin by getting the weak elements out of the way. First of all, the humor is at its weakest overall in this season. There are obviously plenty of funny moments, but I didn't laugh as much as in other seasons. Another thing is that Katara and Sokka are not really great in this season. Katara is sometimes irrational and even obnoxious and Sokka is not as good a comic relief or a character as in the later seasons. This season also has the weakest episode selection of the three. Episodes like Jet, The Waterbending Scroll, The Great Divide, and The Fortuneteller are some of my least favorites just to name a few. A few too many of these episodes are not much better than passable. That said, everything else is amazing. The Storm is my favorite episode of either Avatar show and many other episodes are great. The animation is beautiful, the emotional moments are strong, and the pacing is top notch. In Avatar, the characters have always been the most important aspect. Here, Aang is very well-developed and entertaining. However, it is Zuko and Iroh who carry this season. I think Zuko's character arc is the greatest in animation, and this season does a great job starting it. However, Iroh will always be my favorite character. He is funny, kind, wise, and just plain awesome. Iroh and Zuko have by far the best dynamic of any two characters in the show. When they are on the screen, you know things are good. Zhao is also a very human villain who never overstays his welcome. The action is well-choreographed and focuses on cool bending and fun slapstick over kicks and flips like in Korra. The worldbuilding is also excellent. Overall, this season is a funny, emotional, action-packed journey with memorable characters and magic that makes up for any minor flaw with these elements. This is simply amazing and must be watched. However, the other two books are definitely better.",

Look, I know that they figure out themselves when they get into arguments and stuff, but mkst of the time they act as children fighting, doing whatever to take revenge and take advantage of bad things even if they're the good guys. And most of the time, Katara just busts out her deceased mother EVERY. DAMN. ARGUMENT. Whatever argument it is, it always comes with her mother even if the argument isn't about family issues. I mean it's hard to lose someone you love, but musn't she let go of thaf? \nAnd one more thing, in Book 3 Chapter   that they had a play about the main characters. The big question is how could the scriptwriter of some kind of a research team researched so much detail about their journey? Ain't got any ideas?",

Show interest in one another, trying to go through change and move on from certain things. I found myself teary eyed when it came to Ua's death and AANG STRAIGHT UP DYING IN SEASON TWO. And the ending of the entire show really has this powerful message as instead of killing the fire lord, Aang takes away his bending to ensure he can't hurt anyone else again. And while there are serious moments, there is plenty of space for funny moments (mostly from Sokka). This show is 20/5 and I very much recommend it.",

The cast is top notch, with the main characters evolving richly over three seasons, along with some great guest voices, from Jason Isaacs to Mark Hamill.  Behind the camera, creators Michael Dante DiMartino and Bryan Konietzko craft a rich world and story, with wonderful nods to Chinese culture and martial arts (for example, each bending style is based on a real kung fu style).  While the story is a little cartoony at first, it soon evolves into a true epic of Aang fulfilling his destiny with the help of his friends, while other characters are at initially enemies go through unexpected paths (Prince Zuko's story arc is arguably just as important as Aang's).  Simple put, one of the finest cartoons ever made, and a must watch for anyone.",

It doesn't have the overly lighthearted feel of Season 1 nor the heavy seriousness of Season 3, but finds a nice middle ground that works well. Although it doesn't introduce as many new major characters as Season 1, it features some of the most memorable scenes and moments in the entire series. While Season 3 delves deeper thematically, Season 2 still offers plenty in terms of character development, plot progression and emotional resonance. This season introduces and highlights on fan favorite characters like Toph and Azula, giving them arcs that elevate the story. Overall, Season 2 exemplifies what makes Avatar great - a fascinating tale told through a blend of comedy, adventure, gravitas and heart.",

And remember, I gave the first season a pretty positive review, but it's nowhere near the excellence of this season. The story here I'm not really going to go into so much detail about because once again, the over arcing story is great, just like the last season. But it's when the show is episodic that's really hit or miss. This season, however, was a grand slam in that department. The characters that they met weren't annoying, and if they were, not as annoying as they were in the first season, biggest example of that is with Jet. Speaking of Jet\u2026he's back for this season, and is actually fixed, which is a sigh of relief. Let's be honest, the characters in a tv show is what is going to keep you interested, not the story. Avatar is no exception, and the main characters are great. Aang and Katara are still great, but Sokka might have just became my favorite animated Nickelodeon character this season. He went from a hit or miss funny guy to arguably the best character in the season. But hey, our new member of the group, Toph, is also a great character, especially with her being blind, that seemed like a great touch. Our new villains, Azula and the other two, are also great and insane, and are better \"villains\" but not better characters. Now, I think Sokka is my favorite character this season\u2026but the best characters were Iroh and Zuko. I'm not gonna lie, but I cared about them a lot more then the main characters, and I still cared about the main group, but I thought what Zuko was going through was better. And I think that's all I have to say. If you liked the first season enough, you'll love this one, cause all the problems that season had are all fixed. Please, if you have the opportunity to watch this show, please do, you won't regret it. I know I haven't, and I can't WAIT to watch for season 3!",

I would even argue that Zuko is one of the best characters to ever be written. However, the love story is inappropriate for the characters' age and even for the target audience. Speaking of which, having a very young target audience it impacted the progression of the show, making it too fast. Those are some of the flaws I've found in this show but other than that I would say the show is great. The direction is fresh and original.",

Team Avatar also gain a new ally in the form of a blind, smart alec, earthbending girl, these two new characters are welcomed editions to the show. We get to watch as Zuko struggles to do the right thing as the line between right and wrong grows increasingly more blurred for the estranged teenager, his story arc is easily my favorite this season Zuko goes through a tremendous amount of development throughout this season and I loved every minute of it. This season overall was completely perfect and everything you could've wanted out of the sequel season to season one, our characters are developing a lot through the season some for the best and others for the worst and I enjoyed watching every minute of it, both the good and the bad.",

      "content": "Absolutely brilliant. The incredible action, story, characters, and writing overshadow any minor nitpick. Upon rewatching, I have learned that the key to Avatar is Zuko and Iroh and their dynamic. Before discussing that, I will mention my minor issues. Starting off, there are a few episodes I don't like all that much. However, others like The Avatar State, The Swamp, and City of Walls and Secrets, so this is a nitpick. I also think Azula is underutilized and not as cool as people say. She feels more like the generic OP final boss archetype than the complex character she would become. Also, some of her lines are a bit too sassy and obnoxious for me, sounding like a high school popular girl. Long Feng is also just kind of there, but his voice is very cool. However, everything else is perfect. The story progresses very naturally, moving from finding Aang a teacher to trying to find out how to protect Ba Sing Se to the inevitable final battle that does not disappoint. Some of my favorite fights in the series are here. The showdown between Aang and Azula in The Drill, Toph's incredible victory in The Blind Bandit, and the final battle in Crossroads of Destiny are all amazing in their choreography and emotion. Episodes like Zuko Alone, Crossroads of Destiny, The Drill, Bitter Work, and The Tales of Ba Sing Se are beautiful pieces of media. The Tale of Iroh, Appa's kidnapping, and nearly all of Crossroads are some of the best moments in the series. This is just scratching the surface of Book 2's brilliance. However, the best aspect of Avatar has always been its characters. In this season, the characters are great. Aang has a very strong emotional dilemma in the series and he grows a lot. His trauma of losing Appa is truly heartbreaking and leads to a great subplot. Appa's disappearance proved that he was more than just a mascot and an important part of the show. The subplot gave us great episodes like The Serpent's Pass, The Desert, and Appa's Lost Days.  Katara also grows much more than in Book 1, which is actually saying quite a bit. Sokka is incredibly funny and has a few strong character moments. Toph is a fan favorite for good reason (though I think Sokka is overall the better character). I also really like Mai and Ty Lee and how their opposite personalities work off each other. However, Zuko and Iroh are the absolute highlight of the season. Iroh is my favorite character and Zuko is the most well-developed one. Their dynamic is by far the best in the show, and their relationship develops really well. This is Iroh's best season for humor, wisdom, and charm. The stuff with him and his tea shop is hilarious and his speeches are moving (R.I.P. Mako). The bond between these characters is so strong and it it why the emotional and epic moments work. One scene in Crossroads of Destiny is a good example. Iroh and Zuko are surrounded by evil earthbenders and Azula. The scene plays out like this: Iroh- Did I ever tell you how I got my nickname, 'The Dragon of the West\"? Azula- I'm not interested in a lengthy anecdote, uncle. Iroh- It's more of a demonstration really. (Iroh drinks tea, Zuko looks at him and smiles, and Zuko moves behind Iroh as Iroh breathes fire). This scene is one of the greatest in the show as it perfectly encapsulates how well Zuko and Iroh know each other and how well they work together. I recommend watching this scene, this episode, and this season. It is my favorite in the Avatar universe, even above Book 3. The only other seasons of cartoons I might like more are seasons 4 and 8 of The Simpsons. This season is nearly flawless and I am so glad Shaymalan didn't make a movie out of this. However, the whole show is great and all 3 seasons rock. However, this one edges out Book 3 for Zuko and Iroh's dynamic.",

The character developments are so captivating especially Zuko's, so I guess he's my favorite character now! The writing started strong and finished stronger with a very exciting ending, almost like a cliffhanger! The episodes are full of rich characterizations and some have gut-punch ending (like one of my favorite episodes: \"Zuko Alone\") Some episodes are heavy on funny moments too and I think that's one of the reasons that this show is so great. It perfectly blends humor and the serious and emotional aspects of the plot! Also, the action scenes are very thrilling to watch! Avatar is not just a cartoon show for kids, it's really so great that I think it shouldn't be labeled as just a children show. \n\nSpecial mention to my favorite episodes \ud83d\ude02\nThe Avatar State\nThe Cave of Two Lovers\nZuko Alone\nThe Chase\nThe Secret of the Fire Nation\nCity of Walls and Secrets\nTales of Ba Sing Se\nLake Laogai\nThe Earth King\nThe Crossroads of Destiny",

Toph was also a good addition to the series and her episode that focuses on the way different people learn and how a teacher must adapt really resonated with some of my academic experience. Add to that the compelling ideas about how a loss of a sense increases bending ability which alludes to the idea that bending acts as a sixth sense was a clever idea. When I first saw the season I must have watched it out of order because I remember is as my least favorite but upon re watching it is a significant step up from Season 1 and an ultimately great season overall.",

Touching on mature themes like war, genocide and imperialism, it is also a series with a defined structure, full of compelling and well-developed characters and a funny sense of humor and good morals.

But the most amazing part of this season is the characters. Each one develops in a great way that doesn't feel forced or too fast and maintains complex and nuanced relationships with the others.

The character of Zuko might well be the most brilliantly conceived and executed cartoon character of all time. He had so much depth and development. His story will have you crying and going from laughing at and hating him to rooting for him as if he was a real person; a close friend. The ending will leave you with a euphoric feeling that soon fades to tragic emptiness,  just craving more. Avatar: The Last Airbender is truly one of the most beautiful stories I have ever seen put to film and without a doubt the best I have seen adapted for television.

      "content": "Wow! What an incredible TV show! This is actually the most successful TV show Nickelodeon has ever created. It has now become my favorite TV show ever! I really appreciate how this TV show focuses on bringing people together rather than resorting to conflict. There are many powerful messages in the show, but the primary one is the importance of the four elements\u2014Water, Earth, Fire, and Air\u2014for our planet's survival. \n\nI was particularly captivated by Jack De Sena's portrayal of Sokka. Sokka, a 15-year-old, is my favorite character. He is remarkably witty, often coming up with brilliant ideas that turn out to be quite humorous. Additionally, he is a skilled warrior and encourages his friends to strive for what is right.\n\nI also found Zach Tyler Eisen's performance as Aang to be highly engaging. Aang, a 12-year-old, is enthusiastic about exploring the world and displays compassion towards his friends during their adventures. He also has a lighthearted side and prefers to unite rather than fight, always prioritizing others over himself.\n\nMae Whitman's portrayal of Katara also intrigued and captivated me. Katara, aged 14, is very caring towards her friends but can be assertive when they don't listen to her. She is nurturing and resolute in the face of danger, standing up against injustice and cruelty.\n\nMichaela Jill Murphy's performance as Toph Beifong was equally intriguing and energetic. Toph, also 12, is sarcastic and direct, occasionally displaying bossiness. However, she is compassionate and resolute when it comes to standing up against injustice.\n\nDante Basco's portrayal of Zuko was also quite intriguing, fascinating, and compassionate. Zuko, aged 16, is intelligent and wise, aiding his friends in resolving conflicts and protecting them.\n\nWhat I particularly admire about this outstanding TV show is its focus on the significance of the four elements in the world. Water symbolizes flow, creativity, and the act of bringing things into existence. Earth represents the maintenance of land, mindset, and space. Fire embodies strength, energy, and decisive action. Air signifies life-force, trust, beliefs, and determination.\n\nAnother aspect I love about this TV show is its portrayal of how a group of exceptional kids can make a difference in the world by believing in themselves. This truly encourages both me and the audience, emphasizing the power of kids to effect positive change by believing in themselves.\n\nI extend my heartfelt gratitude to Michael Dante DiMartino, Bryan Konietzko, and the entire Nickelodeon Studios for creating this remarkable TV show. It is filled with themes of trust, forgiveness, empowerment, fate, destiny, and desire. I sincerely hope that more movies and TV shows with profound societal messages that bring people together and shed light on overlooked stories will continue to be produced.",

The humor is actually pretty good and can provide a nice cushion to the whole evil-tyrant-is-trying-to-take-over-the-world thing. The characters develop in heartfelt, believable, creative ways. The series ends with one of the best wrap-ups of any finale, bringing a logical, emotional and satisfying arc to a close for all major characters. I only passively watched this show on Nick as a kid here and there. Sitting down with it as an adult, I was blown away by the music, themes, colors, characters, worldbuilding, and Avatar's commitment to tell its story and then not stick around for extra cash.",

I love how it takes the highlights of cultures and histories around the world and brings them together in a unified story of understanding.

The character development and complexity of said characters are amazingly done.

This season was is epic that it basically has two finales, this was the perfect conclusion to this vast, epic, and addictive show. There is one tiny gripe I have to say about this season and that is that they failed to deliver on the build-up to Zuko's mother, but aside from that, this season is so good that they even were able to make a recap episode creative and entertaining. I remember when this season was released and watching each new episode with my father, then anxiously awaiting next week's episode. I love this show so much that I had to go out and buy the DVD box set when it came out, I really miss the world of Avatar and hope we get to revisit its fascinating world again soon.

      "content": "Absolutely amazing. Nearly everything is leveled up over Book 2 (I still like Book 2 better because Book 3 is missing the best part of the show). That said, this season has by far the best episode selection. Six of my ten favorite episodes are from Book 3. Episodes like Sozin's Comet, The Southern Raiders, Day of Black Sun, Sokka's Master, The Firebending Masters, and The Boiling Rock are flawless pieces of media that I constantly rewatch. This season also has my favorite episode, The Beach. While The Storm and Zuko Alone do resonate with me more and I consider them to be better episodes, The Beach is not only great at humanizing its villains and adding hardcore emotion, but this is the funniest episode. Azula made me laugh out loud at least 5 times and every other character, even the most minor ones, made me burst out laughing. Other good aspects are at their best in this season. The animation is fantastic and truly stunning at times. The action is at its best with the battles in Sozin's Comet and Katara vs Hama are fantastic, creative, and emotional. I also find this to be the funniest season. The Beach and The Ember Island Players are the funniest episodes in the show and moments like \"Hello, Zuko here.\" are literally comedy gold. There are also plenty of tears to be shed. Azula's end, Katara's bloodbending, the campfire scene in The Beach, Sokka and Toph accepting death, and Zuko and Iroh's reunion make me cry every time. The characters are also great. Aang, Katara, Sokka, and Toph are definitely at their best from a humor and character stand point. Aang's fear and dilemna with killing Ozai, Katara's dark vengeance and reluctant trust, and Sokka's rise to leadership are truly compelling character motivations. However, this season does have two issues. The first is minor, and that is one episode. Nightmares and Daydreams is my least favorite episode of any Avatar show. It's humor is awful and so many lines made me facepalm. The tone is inconsistent, going from juvenile and obnoxious to dark and terrifying. The only good things were one or two jokes being so crazy I laughed. What can I say, shock humor just isn't good anymore. However, the real issue is the lack of Iroh. Iroh is hardly in the season, only playing a major role in the finale and maybe one other episode. As he is my favorite character, this initially bothered me. However, I now realize that this does hurt the season. The highlight of the other two seasons was Zuko and Iroh's dynamic. They worked off each other so well and are truly the duo that learns the most in the show. Zuko instead learns a lot on his own in this season. That's all well and good, but I prefer when the two work together. However, the scene where they reunite only works so well because we missed Iroh so much. I can't complain too much, but Iroh is the best character and if he was in the show more, I would have smiled a bit more throughout. Granted, this is nearly perfect and truly media at its absolute best. Too bad Korra never lived up to it.",

This season can only be described as epic with a great finale that ties up every loose end except Zuko's mothers whereabouts but that information can be found in extended lore for those who are interested. The only gripe I could possibly have is that the fire lord while a clear evil threat and presence has next to no motivations other than mustache twirly world domination. Azula is a much more compelling villain will her lack of motherly love due to her sociopath tendencies, manipulation and cruelty which could have led her to feel she needed to prove herself by ruling the world but that is not to take away from what this series was able to do in its story telling and journey in this incredible world. I am not an anime fan at all but there are two anime shows I have ever been a fan of and that Avatar the Last Air bender and The Boondocks. There is certainly a reason for that.",

The end of season 2 was absolutely sad, and as season 3 begins, the uprising energy and storyline just keeps going. \nIncredibly inspirational story and full of thoughtful eastern philosophies. 100% would recommend.\n\nEdit after a few days. I have learnt so much from watching this show. The PSD after watching this show is stronger than pretty much all the shows I have watched in the past. The character building is so effective that I felt like I lost a really good friend after the show ends. The utilization of the theme music is near perfection.

Had some of the best villains and charachter arcs in cinematic history. The music is one of the best parts that are overshadowed. This is not a kids show. This is a show that anyone could watch and find the beauty in. It is by far the best television show I have ever watched. It surpassed any movie I have ever watched either. Watching as an adult versus as a kid,  I realized how incredibly diverse it was in real life issues, historic lessons and culture. 100 stars if I could give it stll wouldnt be enough. I can't wait for the live action version.",

There was this lame assassin that was hired to kill the avatar and he was just merely an obstacle with no character at all.  Once they invaded the Fire Nation in The day of Black sun the show got great again and the characters seemed more similar to their appearances in the first two seasons (Except for Zuko).

Only bits and pieces of different episodes stuck with me over time. I always thought it was a good show, but it was never anything more than that. Just some good entertainment. As I\u0092ve grown up (some would say I haven\u0092t), I\u0092ve gotten into conversations about it here and there. Either people remember it like I do, as a pretty good, fun show, or they love it to death, acting like it\u0092s the greatest television show to ever stream across the planet. Hearing people\u0092s adoration for Avatar over the years, I\u0092ve gotten curious. Had I missed something? Was it better than I remembered? So I decided to re-watch it these past couple months. Long story short: Avatar: The Last Airbender IS the greatest television show of all time. \n\nAs I made my way through The Last Airbender, I was continually shocked by how good the show was. Every few episodes or so I was blown away that a cartoon could be so good. I now realize the fault in my thinking. I underestimated the show because it\u0092s a cartoon. I guess it worked in the show\u0092s favor, because I ended up appreciating it even more, but it\u0092s unfair towards the creators. People tend to think that cartoons are just for kids, simply because they\u0092re animated. Recently, with the success of shows like Bojack Horsemen and Rick and Morty, people have understood that cartoons can be incredibly, sometimes shockingly, deep and adult. But because Avatar is a Nickelodeon cartoon, people still characterize it as a kid\u0092s show. The truth is that Avatar is technically a kid\u0092s show, but more so than any other kid\u0092s show ever, it can be enjoyed by anyone. An eight year-old and a 98 year-old can sit down together and receive the same level of enjoyment from it. Because of this, I would call Avatar family-friendly. It\u0092s not a kid\u0092s show. It\u0092s an everyone show, and that might be one of its greatest strengths. Because of Avatar\u0092s incredibly wide audience, it can touch on serious, profound, and emotional issues without being too heavy-handed or serious. So it\u0092s serious without being serious, if that makes any sense. Regardless of everything I just said, I was still a bit embarrassed when I first started watching. During an early episode, before I realized how amazing the show actually is, my roommate and his girlfriend walked into our apartment. I immediately smiled and said, \u0093I know. I\u0092m watching a kid\u0092s show on a Friday night. Don\u0092t judge me.\u0094 Later my roommate told me that his girlfriend had said, \u0093I don\u0092t know why he apologized. That show is fantastic.\u0094 Turns out I wasn\u0092t being lame for watching Avatar; I was being lame for watching Avatar on a Friday night.  \n\nNow it\u0092s time for me to explain why I think Avatar is so good. To be honest, the answer is everything, but I\u0092ll try and be a bit more specific. First of all, the characters are fantastic. They\u0092re richly drawn, and they feel like real people in a real universe. The show starts off slowly with small, serialized adventures. The story becomes more defined eventually, and thankfully a lot of what gets introduced early on is brought back in satisfying ways. The best part about the early episodes is that they slowly and slyly add mounds of characterization to each character, gradually building your affection for them overtime. By the end of the first season, you\u0092ve been introduced to an incredible world, and you\u0092ve fallen in love with the characters that inhabit it. The second season introduces new characters, and the third brings them together for an amazing finale. The way the show adds texture to its main and secondary characters is genuinely something to be admired. Nobody is one-note. Nobody is simple. They really do feel real. \n\nFrom a story standpoint, Avatar is also fantastic. The show runs 61 episodes overall, and I would say all except maybe ten work towards the larger narrative. These ten or so episodes are the most episodic of the bunch, but even at their worst, they still manage to add characterization and simple fun to the series. (One of) The thing(s) that makes Avatar so special is how it\u0092s never black and white. There is good and evil everywhere, in the heroes and the villains. This only adds to the universe as a whole, making it feel lived-in and believable. From an action standpoint, the show is simply stunning. The action scenes are based on real-life martial arts, and the animation brings them to life fully and awesomely. The animation itself is beautiful, and it only gets better as the series goes on. The cinematography is fantastic; the way scenes are framed adds depth to them that would be lost in a lessor effort. The music is amazing. The humor is on point. The emotion is real. The themes are deep. It does not get better than this. \n\nThe Last Airbender ends in a four-part finale that\u0092s essentially a 90 minute movie. Like Avengers: Infinity War, it only works with the foundation that comes before it. But with that foundation, Avatar\u0092s finale proves itself to be one of the greatest conclusions to anything ever. After watching the entire show, it will make you cheer and laugh and cry. I\u0092m not the kind of person who yells things out while watching a movie. The only time I ever remember doing this was during the end of Infinity War for that matter, and I think that was completely called for. But multiple times during Avatar\u0092s finale, I howled at the screen; it was that good. Part of the reason the finale is so satisfying is because the show isn\u0092t dragged out forever. Most TV shows are aired until they\u0092re no longer popular, which leaves them with lackluster and narratively dry endings. Think of The Office for example. Avatar has three planned-out seasons. It wasn\u0092t cancelled; it was designed to be three seasons long. Because of this planning, every character is given exactly the amount of time they need to develop, and everything comes together perfectly in the end. \n\nTrust me, I\u0092m not crazy. If you don\u0092t believe me, google Avatar right now. You\u0092ll see that I am far from the only one who thinks this way. Years of bad publicity from Nickelodeon, a terrible movie adaptation, and a James Cameron movie of the same name have taken the spotlight away from Avatar. But nothing deserves it more than this show. I highly recommend it. Please, if you\u0092ve managed to get to the end of this review, give Avatar a chance. You won\u0092t realize how amazing it is until it\u0092s over, but by then you\u0092ll want to watch it again anyways. That\u0092s because Avatar: The Last Airbender is a modern masterpiece.",
