Nickelodeon, known for wacky shows like SpongeBob, Rocko's Modern Life, and sitcoms like Drake and Josh, took a massive step forward with this anime-inspired animated series that delved into deep philosophical themes, genocide, and war.\n\nWhile the concept of elemental power in media isn't new, the show's approach to integrating each element into its own nation, reflecting the psyches and philosophies of the respective element, is truly remarkable.\n\nThe characters are expertly written and performed, with Zuko being my favorite. His incredible progression from villain to antihero to hero is perfectly captured. Aang is a good character, although a bit too much of a goody-two-shoes at times. Katara, Sokka, and Toph are equally appealing characters.\n\nThe show's brilliance lies in its perfect pacing. While there are occasional filler episodes, each one (except The Great Divide) serves a purpose and adds layers to the intriguing story and its world.\n\nIt's impressive how the show incorporates heavy topics while maintaining a silly sense of humor. It's frustrating when people dismiss it as just a 'kids show'. The series can be enjoyed by anyone, regardless of age. It doesn't pander and handles the heavy subject matter in a mature way.\n\nAfter The Legend of Korra, Nickelodeon didn't seem to follow in the footsteps of Avatar, which was disappointing. Kids need more shows like this, to be honest.",

Brilliant story, clever world building that is respectful to the existing world cultures and an extremely satisfying ending. What I really love about the series is it's incredibly diverse set of characters: people of unstained character, those who are pure at heart, although struggling in the ways they act, ones who are on the right side, but achieve their goals by unforgivable means, people who act wrongly, but due to heartbreaking backstories, and finally characters which are simply evil. All in all, one of the greatest masterpieces of all time",

I love how it takes the highlights of cultures and histories around the world and brings them together in a unified story of understanding.

I would rather sit in a room and bang my head against a wall repeatedly while watching Teletubbies. How are you supposed to take this show seriously when the main character is a bald kid with an arrow on his head so that he doesn't forget where his eyes are? He's an \"AiRbEnDeR.\" What does that even mean? He can bend air? If I reach out, and ball my hands into fists, am I technically holding air? If so, then I can move my hands, and bend the air. WOW! Amazing how that works. The villains are a nation of fire people, and yet they have a BOAT? If you can control fire, WHY DO YOU WANT TO BE NEAR WATER? And why does a hurricane defeat the fire nation?

It all really boils down to one thing, which I will talk about in a sec. First all the great stuff about this series: basically everything except the big problem. The problem being when the show goes for episodic adventures and not an over arcing story. The episodic adventures are fine, but it's a little frightening how much better the over arcing story is. Biggest example is episodes 9-11 for me, with them barely being watchable. The worse of this group being the great divide. Also, the characters that they meet during the episodic adventures are way more annoying than in in the other two seasons. Going back to those three episodes, the biggest culprit of this is Jet. Oh My God do I hate Jet! To be fair, the other two seasons I think also have this problem, just not as drastic. If you can look past those things (which I did for the most part), I could argue that this is the greatest American cartoon series ever made. Again, easily the best Nickelodeon series ever made. Go on Netflix and see for yourself!",

      "content": "I am very sorry to not give this 5 stars, but this season just is not quite as good as the other two. Granted, it is amazing and I instantly fell in love with it. The fact that anybody compares seasons 1 and 4 of Korra to this is kind of ridiculous to me. Let's begin by getting the weak elements out of the way. First of all, the humor is at its weakest overall in this season. There are obviously plenty of funny moments, but I didn't laugh as much as in other seasons. Another thing is that Katara and Sokka are not really great in this season. Katara is sometimes irrational and even obnoxious and Sokka is not as good a comic relief or a character as in the later seasons. This season also has the weakest episode selection of the three. Episodes like Jet, The Waterbending Scroll, The Great Divide, and The Fortuneteller are some of my least favorites just to name a few. A few too many of these episodes are not much better than passable. That said, everything else is amazing. The Storm is my favorite episode of either Avatar show and many other episodes are great. The animation is beautiful, the emotional moments are strong, and the pacing is top notch. In Avatar, the characters have always been the most important aspect. Here, Aang is very well-developed and entertaining. However, it is Zuko and Iroh who carry this season. I think Zuko's character arc is the greatest in animation, and this season does a great job starting it. However, Iroh will always be my favorite character. He is funny, kind, wise, and just plain awesome. Iroh and Zuko have by far the best dynamic of any two characters in the show. When they are on the screen, you know things are good. Zhao is also a very human villain who never overstays his welcome. The action is well-choreographed and focuses on cool bending and fun slapstick over kicks and flips like in Korra. The worldbuilding is also excellent. Overall, this season is a funny, emotional, action-packed journey with memorable characters and magic that makes up for any minor flaw with these elements. This is simply amazing and must be watched. However, the other two books are definitely better.",

Look, I know that they figure out themselves when they get into arguments and stuff, but mkst of the time they act as children fighting, doing whatever to take revenge and take advantage of bad things even if they're the good guys. And most of the time, Katara just busts out her deceased mother EVERY. DAMN. ARGUMENT. Whatever argument it is, it always comes with her mother even if the argument isn't about family issues. I mean it's hard to lose someone you love, but musn't she let go of thaf? \nAnd one more thing, in Book 3 Chapter   that they had a play about the main characters. The big question is how could the scriptwriter of some kind of a research team researched so much detail about their journey? Ain't got any ideas?",

Show interest in one another, trying to go through change and move on from certain things. I found myself teary eyed when it came to Ua's death and AANG STRAIGHT UP DYING IN SEASON TWO. And the ending of the entire show really has this powerful message as instead of killing the fire lord, Aang takes away his bending to ensure he can't hurt anyone else again. And while there are serious moments, there is plenty of space for funny moments (mostly from Sokka). This show is 20/5 and I very much recommend it.",

The cast is top notch, with the main characters evolving richly over three seasons, along with some great guest voices, from Jason Isaacs to Mark Hamill.  Behind the camera, creators Michael Dante DiMartino and Bryan Konietzko craft a rich world and story, with wonderful nods to Chinese culture and martial arts (for example, each bending style is based on a real kung fu style).  While the story is a little cartoony at first, it soon evolves into a true epic of Aang fulfilling his destiny with the help of his friends, while other characters are at initially enemies go through unexpected paths (Prince Zuko's story arc is arguably just as important as Aang's).  Simple put, one of the finest cartoons ever made, and a must watch for anyone.",
