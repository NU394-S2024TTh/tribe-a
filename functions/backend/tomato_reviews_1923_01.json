He could dial it back a bit here though. The real stumble is how thin and stretched the story is.  I really felt the length of the second half of the season even if I enjoyed the acting and some of the period details.  This could be remedied with an impactful season 2.  Fingers crossed.",

The dialogue was ok, but much of it was reminiscing about older times and marveling about how things were changing.  None of this made the movie move along, though, so I found myself tuning out and hitting the FF button.  Some of the scenes were good (lions and hyenas) and some were simply contrived, like the overturned boat saga.  I am a huge fan of 1883, and I think that is one of the best depictions of the Oregon Trail ever done.  However, 1923 is not anywhere near that level of writing.  The season ended abruptly with no resolution (unless you count the killing of the nuns and priests - but even that story is unfinished).   Wait until season 2 to be released maybe, before starting season 1.",

Like many others, I was excited to see two big stars come onto this one, but they don't add anything special at all, like when you have a famous star do the voicework in an animated movie but their voice isn't distinctive so it could be anybody.  But Harrison and Helen can't be blamed to much, the writers didn't give them anything at all to work with.  The writing is totally lazy here and, as if by way of compensation, the violence is amped up to stomach-churning levels.  If we can't make you care about out characters with writing and acting, then lets kick their butts and brutalize them until we wake up your empathy.  But it doesn't quite work that way.  Also, the numerous villains are all stereotypical.  The actors playing them have a certain gravitas, but what they do is idiotic.  The first season dribbles away without much ever happening, apart from the endless sadistic brutality of priests, nuns, police, a shepherd and a miner.  None of whom have any inner life that can make you understand how they came to act the way they do.  It's just in the script for them to be brutes and so they are. Probably the outline for this series was about the same length as 1883 but they decided to pad it out to two seasons instead of telling the story succinctly in one limited series.

I must have missed something in the narrative at the beginning. Started out strong with great performances by all the cast.  By the third episode, I was beginning to rethink everything.  By the time we watched the fourth, fifth and remaining episodes I was sick of Spenser's \"look\" (wounded), Alexandra's non-stop talking (which we couldn't understand) and the endless sexual/soft porn scenes - I'm thinking \"doesn't she have any other clothes\" plus the endless \"trouble\" they in which they found themselves.  One scene (on the ship) and I thought \"shades of the Titanic\"!  Let's then throw in a bunch of S & M stuff with two prostitutes (who could've left that damn house), a greedy land grabber and a huge dose of \"racism\" where the foreman's wife is brutally taken from her family and a \"deputy\" calls her kids \"mongrols\".   The only believable scenes were the ones from the \"Indian Training Schools\" with Teonna and what she and Joe endured.  That I believe.  Would I recommend this series to people?  Maybe.  People have to watch it for themselves.  These words are my opinion.   The other issue I have is where this house is located:  on top of a hill with no outdoor signs of a privy, no landscaping, where are the barns/horses/equipment located?

This entire season is set in an amazing era when the ancient world fell away and the roller coaster ride toward modernity began.

The Dutton family is aptly tough as nails, a clear carry over from the struggles of 1883 and carry forward to the ongoing saga of Yellowstone.  \nSalute to Taylor's courage to explore the painful history of North America after the physical genocide of natives, namely their cultural genocide through church schools, associated humiliation, and many unmarked graves. This issue has barely been addressed in popular media. More historical wrongs are unearthed every year, so this issue needs to be highlighted and reconciled. \nThe Kenya storyline is sweeping and romantic, taking me back to the glory of Out of Africa. Having spent my childhood there, I was enamoured by the accuracy and authenticity of the storyline. The great pains taken to reproduce Africa of the period were truly impressive. The romance between Spencer and Alexandra is for ages and makes one feel alive, and immersed in destiny. \nThe calibre of the acting is just top class, especially from Ford, Mirren and Dalton. What gravitas and finesse. It is clear this tale is a multi-season arc of survival and greed, of revenge and ambition. Can't wait to see it unfold.",

I get that the filmmakers wanted to drive home the terrible ways America treated NA in those days, and I get that some so-called christians also were terrible. The goal of fairly presenting these realities was deeply subverted through the decision to attack the audience with wildly excessive depictions of this abuse. \n\nWould it have really been too much to give the good, decent, honest, loving Christians who lived in those times just a few minutes of screentime? The ones that far out-numbered the vile racist and abusive ones? Would it have betrayed some political objective to give a few minutes time to show the people who treated the NA's with respect as equals? Instead, we were practically waterboarded with the message \"white christians are the worst humans on Earth\" over several episodes.

However, stay off the ocean and stick to horses because the survival of the sinking of the tug was stupid.\nI can't fault the acting, Helen Mirren is surperb even when given a less than starring role. However that doesn't make up for the dragged out plot. Either get the \"hero\" to Montana in the first episode of Season 2 or I'm out.",

The story of Spencer and Alex is very dramatized, but I love it and enjoy it whenever they are on the screen. The storyline of Teonna Rainwater is difficult to watch, but it absolutely shares insight and truth about the harsh history of the time period. I am excited to see where her character goes in the future! The only story that seemed to leave us with a little hope in the last episode. The last two episodes' pacing was rough. Not satisfying to watch. Very depressing. I felt the hooker scenes wasted valuable storytelling time. It could have been shown briefly, but why dwell so long there? And then show what was basically the same exact scene as the penultimate again in the final episode. It was very annoying and poor storytelling in my opinion of Donald's character. It made me dislike the entire episode. Trying a little too hard to be like the early seasons of Game of Thrones here. I just don't want this in my Westerns. I would like to recommend this show to family and friends, but the sadism in it genuinely makes me a little embarrassed to recommend it. We can show it briefly, but why dwell? What's the point? I preferred the pacing of 1883 much more, and that it was a cleaner show to watch.",

It's as if they wanted a second season, so they added a lot of useless, unnecessary and disgusting B.S. Some parts should've been x-rated.  It would be nice if these writers would leave a few things to the imagination.  Rather than focusing on the Duttons in Montana, and what life was like there,  the story continues to go off in different directions.  Another spinoff could be made possible based solely on Alex and Spencer. All three shows are lacking. Starting with Yellowstone, they never answered the question about the  skull, which was found on their property by the excavators two seasons ago. Elsa supposedly died in 1883, and now they have her narrating 1923. Since Elsa was married to an Indian, I expected to see more on how the Duttons were related to the Indian tribe and specifically if there would be some ties to Teonna Rainwater. All three shows have been a bit disappointing but 1923 has been the worst yet. I think Mr. Sheridan needs to focus on doing one show really well instead of trying to produce so many at once.  I would not pay to watch his shows again and I would not recommend 1923 to anyone.",

The nuns are truly horrible. The Native Americans noble.  The matron, matronly. The stoic heroes are stoic all the time.  Every character has exactly one characteristic and sticks with that at all costs. The series isn't over yet, so I'll also not rule out the possibility that the show redeems itself, but so, it is too mired in cliche and romance-novel plotting to really achieve any sort of greatness.   See a ghost ship in act one.  Be assured that they will hit that ghost ship in act two, even if the odds of running into the same ship adrift in open water when your own ship is steaming at full speed (and then have it mysteriously disappear after doing its job) is next to zero.  Adrift in open water, cue the shark.  Gun fight between main characters and villains? Every shot from the good guys will hit its target, and despite the lack of antibiotics or blood transfusions in 1923 rural America, any main character that isn't instantly killed will have invincible plot armor to protect them.  Also, despite having at least three arcs running at time, it has the amazing how little plot can be advanced in an episode.

I despaired at finding anything worthwhile to watch on television or in the theatres, and along comes these three extraordinary compelling pieces art. And have no doubt, Yellowstone, 1883, and 1923 are/ will be pieces of Americana: a true homage to how this country became great, the resilience of its people, the leaning into of the freedom described in our founding documents, and the practical, sometimes excruciating lessons of responsibilities learned. Also, the passions and romance of the story couples that harken back to old and epic romantic stories now absent from our screens for a very, very long time are a pure joy to watch. And the heroines! Absolutely fantastic! Heroines the like of which I haven't seen since before Cameron abandoned his story-telling and started producing sillinesses like Avatar. There are moments of Wokeness, but they relegate themselves to the Indian scenes, which are special in their own way as another perspective but not as the grand American vision that our ancestors fought so hard for. As a descendant of native Americans (both sides of my family owned and worked land here, fought in freedom wars here before this country was a country), I appreciate Sheridan's giant and necessary reminder of how scrappy, how honorable, how determined, how romantic, and how wonderful our ancestors were. It's as though we are given permission to be proud of our country and heritage again. So Taylor Sheridan, I thank you for television worth watching and a breath Of fresh air from the the stale rancid woke cultural rot that we've been subjected to for going on 40 years now.

Too bad MTV productions finds it necessary to dilute the viewing experience with so many long interruptions. But I guess they have to have some way to finance Harrison's and Helen's enormou$ paycheck$. I can live without having to watch so many commercials, so I probably won't be watching any more episodes.",

And, the court scene at the beginning had around 200 people in the courthouse. That is just so unrealistic. I can see 25 people, maybe 30, but NOT 200. People before the 1970s didn't say the F word like they do today. And in 1923, the 1700s and 1800s, people didn't say the F word, or even cuss. What's with you Hollywood people trying to make movies? Go back to school and take some History and English classes, and quit trying to be so creative. Just make the show the way things really were. We don't need your \"spin\" on how you would have done things or the \"F\" bombs and cussing you would have done. That only makes your \"work\" stupid!",
