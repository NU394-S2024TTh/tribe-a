Lots of laughs and I liked how they introduced the suspenseful arc at the end.\n\nCary name-drop was neat and I'd be stoked to see anybody from TGW/TGF show up and do a cameo.

To be fair, TGW also relied heavily on the investigation part, but at least every case in TGW had an interesting premise and the non-recurring characters like clients/perpetrators/witnesses were written with more nuance and realism.\n\nI also hope that Wendell Pierce will get to shine  more as the show goes on.

I would have missed the Good Fight but she was crazy not to drop everything and go to Costa Rica with him LOL.\n\nElsbeth is still evolving. I think I've seen her twice (midway season two rewatch) and she mentions a son and just seems out of touch (maybe) but not the quirky beloved character she became.  I suppose there will be concerns as to whether she is or should be seen as on the spectrum like Big Bang Theory?\n\nSeeing how the Kings grew and had fun with the Good Fight (those Schoolhouse Rock parodies) gives me hope for the new GREAT Detective, too.\n\nProcedural, not legal is a good point.

What's bugging me about Elsbeth is that as soon as she sees or meets the perpetrator she suspects them right away based on hardly anything. Then the rest of the show is spent proving her right. To me there's no discovery, 10 minutes in and she has made up her mind that this person did it.",

All the police look like dumb dumb compared to Elsbeth who is supposed to be a lawyer not Sherlock Holmes. If she is so good at being a detective, why not just sack everybody else and hire her Instead?",

But this show just has Elsbeth spotting an obvious \u2018clue\u2019 and knowing who the killer is right away, then interviewing other suspects to fill time because \u2018police procedure\u2019 won\u2019t let her simply arrest the person she suspects.\n\nI\u2019m so glad other people found the show tiring.
