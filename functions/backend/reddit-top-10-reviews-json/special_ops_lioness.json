It's not bad writing nor did they forget to scrub. \n&nbsp;  \nLook at the date and description of that picture on the pseudo Facebook that got her found out. It was commented on by the father of a Marine only 2 hours earlier. Most social media comments come within the first day of posting, so it makes sense it's a new upload. No amount of scrubbing can stop that.  \n&nbsp;  \nThe other photo of her younger self could have just become publicly visible due to it clearly being an older archived article.  Go look at any local newspaper's website and try to read articles from 15 years ago.  You'll find countless broken images, if not straight up 404s.  A web developer simply fixing the image cache could have brought that photo back up.  \n&nbsp;  \nThey literally show the facial recognition software failing to find anything twice before it does. Once outside at security, and then again by the same fiance using the same computer.  So clearly it wasn't just someone forgetting to scrub her profiles.",

Considering how high above expectations the entire series was, for her to be able to kill him so easily and then manage to get out alive and relatively uninjured was extremely unrealistic and pretty lazy story telling.\n\nI have been beyond pleasantly surprised with the series, I didn\u2019t have huge expectations despite being a Sheridan fan as well as a fan of Zoe Saldana. I liked the show to the point where I waited for it to be released super eagerly every week which isn\u2019t something I\u2019ve done recently? I just thought it was that good. The finale really let me down.\n\nAlso, they wanted to pull her out even tho they\u2019ve been after the man for 20 years? Wtf was that even about?! We didn\u2019t need another small storyline, we needed them to spend more time on the stories we already had fleshed out and just needed well told and not rushed finales. \n\nI do hope it gets renewed and they keep the cast. Maybe Aliyah attempts to go on a revenge tour (did her fianc\u00e9 get killed as well? That seemed unclear to me) and when she finds Cruz she decides she\u2019s conflicted and Cruz shows her that same video she had to watch and they are able to turn her as she clearly as connections to terrorists whether she knows it or not. I don\u2019t like that we didn\u2019t have any actual closure between them. I thought Cruz was going to try to take her with her.",

The one relationship with love as the basis Aaliyah and Cruz is built on Deception from Espionage. The Takeaway is everything is essentially a Political Marriage and Power just is it ultimately isn\u2019t good or bad. Power is transferred, shared, created or taken its a reflection on the How & Why of Power. Winning and Losing are just variations of the Flow of Power. I think a parallel theme of Power is an Illusion is prevalent. Also how morality is meaningless everything is centered around  the Powerful and Pawns.

Still, there is something about how she shared details of what her husband knew, who her father is. Her relaxed response to Cruz saying, \u201cI\u2019m not who you think I am,\u201d as well as her calm response to Cruz\u2019s reluctance to answer her question, \u201cAre you my friend?\u201d - \nI think, somewhere, deep down, Aaliyah suspects Cruz isn\u2019t \u201cZara\u201d.\n\nAaliyah\u2019s tears at the end lend themselves to shock (relief?) - but not devastation. Also, her saying, \u201cBut you want this,\u201d isn\u2019t arbitrary. I think, without really knowing, Aaliyah senses there is a mission beyond friendship for Cruz that has somehow turned into real love - unintentionally - for them both.\n\nThe two have already been intimate. So, we know there is physical attraction. But where it may have been faked before, Aaliyah seems to be speaking now from a place of vulnerability: If she\u2019s coming to Cruz because she \u201cwants to feel loved,\u201d - then she knows Cruz truly loves her.\n\nI could be way off. But there\u2019s also something about Aaliyah sharing the day and then the night, before her life is due to change, that she doesn\u2019t want to go through with it, and that she shared that with her family, which leads me to feel she subconsciously suspected she could be freed from it by Cruz.\n\nFinally, the beacon (necklace) used by Cruz to alert the squad was used. But the audience was shown two (the second was a bracelet). Taking the _Chekov\u2019s Gun_ theory into account, might the second one be used in season two, perhaps?\n\nJust some thoughts\u2026",

Almost as important (or more important depending on your beliefs) are the discussions in the situation room between SecState Mullins and CIA DepDir Byron, on the USA knowingly allowing Islamic terrorists to target USA and allies as a means of preventing popular revolt against the Saudi and other Middle East ruling elites. Also interesting are the brief dialogues about \n\nthe CIA people believing Western ruling elites are incapable of leading their countries safely out of crises (also the topic of a monologue by Errol); \n\nthe worry about the effects on Russia and China; and \n\nSecState Mullins statement that the elimination of terrorist financier Amrohi is a mistake while \"we're still trying to wean the county off fossil fuels.\" \n\nDid anyone else pick up on these memes? \n\nMakes me wonder about what wildly successful Hollywood producer and writer Taylor Sheridan -- who probably has access to rich and powerful elites most people don't -- is actually trying to do here. Oliver Stone and JFK, anyone?",

        "content": "A little late! I really liked the first season overall. There were a few plotpoints that I think most folks have covered that seemed *strange*. Like after just losing an asset due to an undisclosed tattoo, Joe decides now is the time to basically have Cruz tortured, leaving her to have to lie her way out of a dozen bruises. There were a few moments like that that made the team look unprofessional in a way that couldn't be explained.\n\nThe last episode was fine overall. I think I agree that it wrapped up too rapidly and neatly for what was a moment that the entire season had built up to.\n\nI think the husband finding Cruz's photo online was a big, big case of lazy writing. There were so many other ways that she could've been outed in-context, but that was one that was never built up to or had been planted beforehand at all. It just comes out of nowhere, so it just wasn't very satisfying.\n\nThe extraction is very clean and everyone gets away with no issues. And meanwhile I think the implication is that *maybe* Aaliyah will be none the wiser if she thinks Cruz did all of that to save her from an arranged marriage.\n\nCruz's reaction also felt kinda silly. I get the adrenaline was pumping and all that, but the show didn't work hard enough to show Cruz was having all these changes of heart. It was fine with building out her relationship with Aaliyah, but everything else: she was acting like Lioness had forcibly put her through stuff against her will, when the whole first part of the series tried to show that Cruz was taking control of her own destiny, pushing herself harder than anyone, and throwing herself into the most challenging of scenarios. Now at the end, she feels bad for the dude on the Most Wanted List and is angry at Joe for not giving her an out. (She did several times.)\n\nOverall, I really enjoyed the whole season, but the writing really struggled to bear out enough of a believable conflict within Cruz to make the final episode feel tense or dramatic or unpredictable. And the final operation is done too cleanly after a very unbelievable catalyst. Of all the dangers they established for Cruz at the wedding, it felt wrong that a random check on social media is what did her in.\n\nWhat I really did like was the toll that the operation was taking on its highest ranking members. Joe is starting to lose control of her family from being gone so much, believing that her husband has everything handled and the occasional talk with the kids being enough. Come to find out, it was never under control. And for as much as Joe thinks such a work/life balance is possible in Lioness, the woman that she seems to respect the most, Meade, has so many problems on her own that her home life is practically sterile. We see that's where Joe could be heading.",

But to have it all coalesce into _this_? C\u2019mon, fr? They\u2019ve could done so much more! \n\nIt surprises me that this episode was an entire hour too! I really think they should\u2019ve tried to extract Aaliyah as well. I know, I know \u2014 it probably wouldn\u2019t have been realistic but it would\u2019ve been great for a season 2! Now, I\u2019m not really sure how a S2 could even go down (if it even does at this point\u2026) but I guess we\u2019ll have to wait and see. \n\nI also think that the reveal of Aaliyah\u2019s mother was a bit lacklustre? Like, OK yes, we know she has fucked up family dynamics but all we got was that? I\u2019m not gonna be heavily critical on Sheridan for that but seeing as how he\u2019s all about character development\u2026 _side eyes_. \n\nI will say though that I do sort of wish we had more time with the QRF team \u2014 they felt like great teasers of a meal we never truly got to enjoy so if S2 does come around, I\u2019m hoping we see some more of them then!",

Looking at the series as a whole, it feels like the main plot is just a drawn out movie script with the B-plot around the family just being filler (seeing as it basically lead to nothing). The border shooting felt like a budget callback to Sicario. And while I'm not one for needless shocker or twists, I feel like this story really could've benefited from at least one or two. I haven't been really invested in anything he's made (besides 1923) since the Neo-western trilogy, and I'm not sure he'll really recover now with all these shows going on simultaneously.",

Not even as a Plan B, as the primary plan!  It didn\u2019t happpen, but it was the plan.\n\nAnd the other thing about the beat down, was it destroyed the trust of the asset and her handler completely. It also damaged the trust of all of the other teammates when they found out what Jo did.\n\nIt was such a bad move, unnecessary, cover blowing, and relationship destroying. There is no plot reason this extreme beating should\u2019ve happened. Except for the fact that the show seemed to like having Cruz beaten to a pulp and and victimized it every turn (edited for clarity)",

She really did swallow it the best she could, but when I saw Ehsan talk down to her, I knew it was over. And a complete lack of experience that was so obvious! The girl joined the Marines, not the CIA, for a reason. She doesn't have the emotional skill to be an undercover agent.\n\nAlso Cruz screamed gay from the start. Not saying that you couldn't be gay and do this mission, but with Cruz's unresolved trauma, attraction to Aaliyah and I suppose in some way yearning/wanting to be loved by someone, it was also kinda doomed.",

Yes it is an action show, also romance if u want but I think the main thing issues he's trying to highlight are the connection between war and society/economy. It could also be me giving Sheridan too much credit and reading into it too much \ud83d\ude06 \ud83e\udd23",

They should\u2019ve at least have her cover blown in some other way, that just felt sloppy.    \n   \nLike maybe instead of having Cruz\u2019s boyfriend getting killed off screen, maybe he posts a picture of her after she\u2019s embedded and her presence has been scrubbed and that\u2019s how she gets blown.  Like he\u2019s still looking for her all these years later, someone sees her or he posts a picture on social asking about her and that ends up getting id\u2019ed.

But yeah a little bit sketchy and plot driven solution.\n2. I think they could have explained the contradiction better. One department or agency has his name on the list driven by political considerations and other agencies are supposed to understand we don't really want this to happen. So just write up contingency plans. Example: Suleimani was on a list for I think 2 decades but everyone knew we were tracking him closely and at some point the US and Mossad had assets there that would be lost if he was actually killed. Without getting into politics, then, a new administration decided to waive those considerations.   \nIn the show, what's confusing is why the plot to kill him - which was underway for some time - wasn't flagged earlier. But perhaps the show writers could explain it as a contingency being developed that then moved forward at the last minute without proper channels. Seems unlikely in real life. This is a fictional show. The real lioness program is just about having female soldiers do the up front work when searching houses in Muslim countries as part of cultural sensitivity. There have, of course, always been rumors that women sometimes act as girlfriends to get close to targets or assets but this is a gray area that is denied. I met a girl in Jordan once who later stateside told me she was doing this for an agency but I think she was a delusional fabricator. But ya never know.",

I don\u2019t even count the mental health of people who participated in the operation for both parties. This is a game where some people calls others terrorists, therefore suddenly they have the rights to liberate them.\nBlack mirror episode 0305 where the soldiers senses were manipulated by a chip to see their targets as Roaches is an on point example of a similar case. I like the Series it is not only hit squad story but much more!\n\nPS: Btw, I highly doubt if a most powerful country in a planet wants to neutralize a target for 22 years and still were not able to it.

She's made many sacrifices for her country, but to what avail? We now find out the whole time there's a probability of all her sacrificing, her hard work, her believing her commitment to her country was better than being at home with her family is probably all a sham. Someone most likely planted those pictures and almost blew the whole mission because some people deciding on stock prices are who really are in control. It really gives us a vantage point of how many military personnel have given their lives, for what? When the system is being manipulated by those that work Mon-Friday banking hours and have lobster for lunch. It's an eye opener and makes me respect military personnel even more seeing what they battle with to have a military career and a home life.",

        "content": "Should have paid more attention on Cruz's dialogue with Aaliyah in the final episode. Aaliyah clearly explains how his dad had been deemed a terrorist because unlike other competitors eg.Exxon he sells oils to anyone without being involved in politics. He stands by the policy 'willing buyer willing seller' which makes his business model profitable and labelled as a terrorist.   \nAaliyah's dialogue with Joe in the boat after being rescued quits after she noticed she had been used to assasinate an innocent person for the sake of influencing oil markets. She clearly states that the CIA had now created terrorism in Aaliyah's future kids once they eventually learn their grandfather was killed by the US government in unethical business practise so as to protect US lobbyist's interests; to be specific Kaitlyn's husband who seems to be one of the elites.",

        "content": "Yay, new post!!! I'm still obsessed. I loved the show despite its many flaws. But yeah, there are lots of holes and ways that TS asks we suspend our disbelief a bit far. \n\nBruises: The whole thing happens over 4-5 weeks, so the bruises still healing make sense. Not trying to cover them? Silly especially after Aaliyah shows her they CAN be covered. \n\nTattoo: When she makes Cruz strip down, why not say \"My last asset lied about a tattoo and it got her killed. So prove it.\" Cruz would've gotten that. BUT I suppose the point was to show Cruz's vulnerability/feistiness and develop their angsty rapport. (Cruz was so adorably excited when she first walked in, Jo knocks her down hard!)\n\nSERE: WTF?? Re-torturing and re-traumatizing her was senselessly cruel. She creates zero trust, puts her in a dumb spot to explain to Aaliyah, then does nothing to help her come up with a story?? BUT the injuries are why we see Aaliyah's caring/compassionate side, calling the doctor, the speech a man beating you, etc.\n\nExtraction: Silly. Not one flesh wound? Please.\n\nAaliyah: The implication is NOT to think \"Zara\" did this to get her out of an arranged marriage, but that she now thinks their entire relationship was a lie and that she led her straight to her father. She's heartbroken, humiliated and has no idea of Cruz's real feelings for her or that she almost tanked the whole mission to spare her. \n\nPhoto: Meh, I don't know. I'm less bothered by the finding of the photo and more bothered that he would not alert his security team to come with him - she's a Marine who is clearly there under false pretenses, ergo - she's ready!\n\nCruz: \n\n1. I think the actor, writer, and director(s) did a good job of showing Cruz's growing confusion, uncertainty and \"out of her element\"ness. It's subtle, but it's there. She thought she knew what she signed up for, but the reality sinks in with each interaction with Aaliyah. You can see the looks on her face - like she's mulling over every new insight Aaliyah shares. BUT\n\n2. Agree! Cruz attacking her CO because she made her a \"monster\" was dumb. She eagerly signed up for this mission and kept insisting she could do it while Kaitlin and Jo were dubious. She wants someone to blame for her brokenness and poor choices (falling for her mark, not refusing to continue the mission once she was emotionally invested). I do think she saw Amrohi as an extension of Aaliyah - he was personable and human suddenly. And her feelings for Aaliyah and having to do what she did, the WAY she did it, she knows Aaliyah will see her as a monster. So maybe that's what TS was really thinking when he wrote it. He does like the psychology of his characters and that's why he writes character-driven rather than plot-driven shows.",

Maybe, if it made sense. But how would she escape without a gun with 30+ guards? And how would she Rambo her way through it versus fleeing immediately giving her the best chance of surviving?\n\nAlso, I\u2019d argue this scene has some type of commitment to reality of special ops missions. Did I want to see someone go down or get injured? Sure. But the cia team was in position to ambush the guards and wipe them out. They had planned for this and the guards didn\u2019t see this coming.

As far as the audience knows, the only person who knew she was a marine died bc he saw the results on his laptop and immediately went after Cruz. He didn\u2019t enlist security or anything. Bc of that Cruz could have easily gone up to Aaliyah and told her that her fianc\u00e9 threatened her (like he did earlier so not a lie) and he went after her so she defended herself and then the man (Aaliyah didn\u2019t need to know Cruz knew it was her father) also attacked her once she succeeded in killing the fianc\u00e9 so she did what she did in defense so Aaliyah could have the life she wanted if she followed her immediately (which would have also prevented the screaming and therefore delayed security shooting). Explaining everything could have come once they were safe.

They give us a depth and understanding to Joe\u2019s character.  Her motivations, drive, values, etc.     \n  \nSpecifically in this episode we see the juxtaposition between how in control she is when she is in the field and how completely out of her depth she is when dealing with her family in the midst of a crisis.  While this has been a reoccurring theme throughout the season, it\u2019s brought to a head here as we see that she can\u2019t even take a quick phone call from her daughter without it throwing her for a loop.   \n  \nShe balks at feeling ambushed by a phone call from her daughter while preparing to potentially walk into a *literal* life and death ambush.  We see how she has created this barrier between her two worlds and a simple phone call threatens to spill them over into one another and potentially put the entire mission in jeopardy.    We see her emotions at this happening, she knows she\u2019s failing her family but she can\u2019t think about that right now and visibly weighing on her.  \n  \nI get that some people find them tedious or don\u2019t like the idea of a grating teenage daughter storyline stealing scenes in a military thriller series  but it\u2019s all about her character and just sitting here and going, \u2018omg boring filler\u2019 is just, in my opinion, not at all true.  \n  \nI think really what people have more of an issue with and are incorrectly attributing to being filler is a pacing issue where the plotting is a bit uneven making the contrast between these scenes feel like they\u2019re \u2018taking away\u2019 from a more engaging storyline in the Lioness mission itself.

My whole point is that it's entirely within the realm of possibility that even the most diligent attempt to scrub images can be undone by simple things like old images appearing, live or archived.  The CIA isn't all powerful, they can't magically erase images from any site or archive they want.  \n&nbsp;  \nIt's entirely possible that high school image wasn't or still isn't accessible.  What kind of rich guy terrorist facial recognition software doesn't scan American newspaper articles?  It could be an old archived snapshot of that article that is no longer online.  Like the wayback machine.  Or that newspaper could be making older articles publicly available online where as before they weren't.  Add that to the marine photo looking like a relatively recent upload means the whole \"Durr, why did they leave photos of her online\" argument is nullified since one is a new upload, and that high school photo may not even be online.  \n&nbsp;  \nThere's multiple different totally possible scenarios for how it could have happened.

Likewise the show overly commits to correlating almost every character's morality and competency with their proximity to the show's behind the camera perspectives. And in certain moments, Sheridan can't resist making direct to audience didactic addresses. Unfortunately for the show, these are usually done with clunky, unreal, weak dialogue. \n\nTV critics have become really, really hard on shows that do this in recent years, and its a creative excess that a lot of them won't look past anymore. I can think of a bunch of other shows that do this, a lot of which have completely different sets of politics than Lioness, and all of those shows got flak for it from critics. Some of the more egregious examples have been the recipients of review media's worst sandblasting in the last few years.",

Why would X have to go to Y when an entire team is already there capable of doing Z? Because Sheridan wanted them to give a speech and demonstrate their inherent \"goodness\" despite all their flaws. \n\nBut, in the grand scheme, his version of reality is closer to the truth than any show about this type of thing.

I definitely understand the concept of political motives leading to oversimplified characters and weak dialogue, but I don't think that is happening much when it comes to the pure genre spy stuff, which reminds me of Sicario in a very good way. The shooting script for sicario was better than sheridans because villenevue rewrote it and made it less cheesy but Sheridan still has a very deft hand for genre storytelling and thrilling sequences. \n\nI guess what I'd say is that I recognize the bad stuff in this show - it's there, and it's bad. But I think the good stuff is as good as basically anything on TV right now. \n\nI think there is reasonable critical fatigue with Sheridans work, and i actually don't care for the Yellowstone world of shows (amazing pilot but I feel that the character cast is too large and the characters are drawn too thinly to actually make a compelling Succession on the ranch). \n\nI shouldn't paint with too wide a brush about critics and I mostly just wanted to share my appreciation for the show. I like it a lot more than a much more well reviewed show, Hijack, and the critical hit of the year is the second season of the Bear, which to me was awful and squandered everything I loved about the first season.",

It's really about the ability of the writing and the characters to sell you on the plausibility within the world the creator has established. \n\nAnd in this show I'm buying what he's selling- but like I said it's far from perfect so I don't think you're crazy or anything. \n\nSheridan tends to have a few incredible episodes and then some awful ones in his shows.

Look at reacher, one of the things that makes jack reacher so interesting is that at first when people meet him, they think he\u2019s a big dumb guy  only to find he\u2019s usually the smartest guy in the room.very satisfying payoff when he solves the mystery by recalling a mundane detail he had mentioned earlier.\nThere\u2019s no point in lioness that you\u2019re really in suspense. \nthere\u2019s an article I read about Suspense and surprise in filmmaking. Haven\u2019t had a time I was in suspense watching it. \nThink back to the scene where they got the guy who put GHB in Cruz\u2019s drink. What was all that talking for ? \nJoe could have just looked at the two operators and given them a nod and cut away to them taking Cruz to the car. Then have the guys show ups 1 hour later and shower and dump their clothes. Leaves you guessing, is he alive or dissolving in acid. \n\nWhen they catch the kids breaking in, more talking. Why ? Are they doing it for the benefit of the audience? There\u2019s such a thing as revealing too much.",

He was the \"showrunner\" on lioness and literally wasn't on set. He was available via phone call and zoom lol. \n\nI'm not sure I agree about the weakness of sicario writing because I don't really think plausibility is what determines the greatness of a movie. There basically isn't a great spy movie ever made that is actually realistic, it would be so fucking boring. Even zero dark 30 takes big liberties with the actual process of finding bin laden.",

His best stuff feels like he's shining a ray of light into a part or aspect of the world most people aren't familiar with. Everyone has an idea, but he peels back a few layers to get at what's not obviously visible. \n\nThis feels like he's trying to take something true he found elswhere and is trying to transplant it in \"fresh new\" locales.

Also, this girl is really arrogant. She isn\u2019t fit to become a spy.\n\nThey show one group of special force beating up someone from another group for just doing his job. Like what the fuck was that? He even said it was sanctioned by their boss but none of them even says a word to their boss. And how come the friends of the person who got beaten just didn\u2019t do anything?\n\nThe husband doctor is staying at home and instructing someone who is doing surgery at hospital through video call? What the fuck was that? He also gets beaten for no reason at all by one of the patient\u2019s father. And he doesn\u2019t even want to press charges.\n\nThis show had so much potential but they totally spoiled it.",

There is no way they are going to risk an entire team on someone they knew was expendable from the onset and if the asset didn\u2019t know she was expendable taking on that role they were too stupid to be there in the first place. \n\nCruz should have actually been physically strong. Her doing pull-ups was so laughable, I was almost wincing seeing how little muscle engagement was going on and clearly she was either being lifted or standing up doing them. \n\nThe scene of Cruz training in the apartment was so poorly done in every way, and also, with so many cuts back and forth they could have easily made it a bit more believable with her doing more than just push ups and single leg reach crunches, she wasn\u2019t even breaking a sweat. \nAs many people have mention, the bar fight was sooooo outrageous. \n\nBy then time we got to her torture scene, I was already checked out. Everything about the show is over the top and gratuitous. \n\nAs many people have mention, the bar fight was sooooo outrageous. \n\nThis cast can\u2019t even save this show.

The dude is kind of brilliant in his ability to channel the exact flavor of \"rugged, masculine, authoritarian individuality\" that conservatives see when they pose with their guns in the mirror, while still somehow making entertaining, well written shows that usually look amazing.\n\nIt's actually kind of insidious, sometimes.
