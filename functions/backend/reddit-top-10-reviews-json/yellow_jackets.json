I know lots of people who watch shit and scroll on their phone and then have to ask someone to catch them up on the plot because they missed half the movie/episode\u2026some don\u2019t even care enough to catch up and just continue without knowing what\u2019s happening at any point and move on with their day, but I would assume those aren\u2019t the people that are coming here to this sub to talk about a show they barely paid attention to. It\u2019s pretty weird to see those people come on here to discuss a show they didn\u2019t care for\u2026what\u2019s the point?",
