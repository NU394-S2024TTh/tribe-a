The humor is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of theoretical physics most of the jokes will go over a typical viewer's head. There's also Frasier's nihilistic outlook, which is deftly woven into his characterisation- his personal philosophy draws heavily from Narodnaya Volya literature, for instance. The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these jokes, to realise that they're not just funny- they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike Frasier truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn't appreciate, for instance, the humor in Frasier's existential catchphrase \"tossed salads and scrambled eggs,\" which itself is a cryptic reference to Turgenev's Russian epic Fathers and Sons. I'm smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as Frasier's genius wit unfolds itself on their television screens. What fools.. how I pity them.",

Fraiser was actually married and divorced twice (to \u201cNanny G.\u201d and then to Lilith), engaged to Diane and then left at the altar by her before he met Lilith, and engaged to Candy for a brief time (again, before he met Lilith). \n\nHe returned to Seattle after Lilith cheated with whom she called \u201cGoogie\u201d, and he reconciled with his dad. He told the \u201cCheers\u201d crowd that his dad was what his mom actually was: a research scientist whom possibly cheated on his mom (and it of course turns out that Dr. Hester Crane cheated on Officer Martin Crane\u2014and it took Mrs. Lawler to set the record straight after Martin supposedly confirmed Fraiser\u2019s suspicions). \n\nAs Sam Malone pointed out and as we see in \u201cCheers\u201d, Dr. Fraiser Crane made Martin \u201cdead\u201d and \u201ca research scientist\u201d when Dr. Hester Crane was a research scientist and did die during Fraiser\u2019s \u201cCheers\u201d days\u2014which adds a remarkable layer of irony, as the \u201cCheers\u201d crowd met Dr. Hester Crane when she was still alive. \n\nI wonder if Fraiser ever wondered if he somehow brought about his mom\u2019s death in a sense by speaking about his dad as if his dad was her. \n\nPPS I used to watch \u201cFraiser\u201d on Hallmark, and have recently seen clips of it and \u201cCheers\u201d on YouTube of it\u2014and I realized that I somehow mistakenly remembered that he ended up with Roz in the final episode.",

Taking the comedy out of Niles\u2019s and Daphne\u2019s love story and adding some reality was so beautifully done. You felt all the emotions and were left reeling from Frasier\u2019s gentle nudge to Niles to open up his scope a little more and dig further. Beautifully written, beautifully shot, and beautifully acted. (On cellphone so apologies if the formatting is off.)\n\nFrasier: I've nothing else to say. Niles, I love you. And I love Daphne. I just hope the two of you can work this thing out together.\nNiles: No, wait, don't go, don't go. Help me understand, why is everyone acting like I've done something wrong? The only thing I am guilty is loving Daphne, and that's all I've ever done.\nFrasier: Yes. Yes, and how did you love her? From afar. You were never in love with her, you were in love at her. Now, you've been given a chance to experience her in a real relationship and yet for some reason, you're resisting it. Rather than see her as she really is, you keep holding on to the fantasy.\nNiles: No, that's not true.\nFrasier: Niles, the woman gained sixty pounds, and everyone in the world saw it but you. All you ever saw was a perfect woman in a red dress.\n[Niles takes a moment to process this]\nNiles: Okay. If you're right - and that's a big \"if\" - why would I do that?\nFrasier: Maybe Daphne's not the only one who's afraid she won't measure up. Maybe you're afraid, too. After all, if it turns out she's not perfect, then there's a chance things won't work out. Then not only will you lose Daphne, but you'll have wasted the last seven years of your life chasing an illusion.",

The ending to the episode where Frasier dates a woman who looks exactly like his mother. The quiet moment of Martin and his boys just watching Hester say \"I love you\" to the camera just gets to me. Especially a moment where Martin looks down for a second, then back up with a bittersweet smile.\n\n2. Frasier's therapy session with Dr Tewksbury. I first saw this episode as a kid, and didn't really like it because the metaphors and abstract points about the mind confused and frustrated me. But when I saw it again with a better understanding, it quickly became one of my favorite episodes. It's point about how no one achievement can fulfill a whole life was rather eye-opening.\n\n3. The family in the waiting room during Niles' heart surgery. Each little flashback was simple but gripping. My favorite is probably a tie between Martin getting Hester's results, and Roz's scare as a new mother over Alice. But my absolute favorite part is when Daphne breaks down and sobs how there's no future until she knows he's okay. I saw so much of myself in that moment. When a family member is in a tough situation like that, I refuse to think of anything in the future with them. I have a fear that's it's like putting a card in my hand, and Fate sees it just so that they can take it away. It also makes the last moment of her finally imagining their children all the more satisfying.",

Frasier calls Charlotte and instead of canceling the coffee date, he decides to go for it and asks her to lunch instead. Martin looks so incredibly proud of Frasier. \n\nIt was a really quiet, beautiful moment that was acted to perfection by both Kelsey and John.",

He left all of his worldly possessions behind, and I fantasized more than once about pulling a [Bernadine](https://youtu.be/iiTxcuMkqk4) but it was a combination of respect for his father and wanting to stay on the right side of karma I left everything intact and ended up getting movers to haul the shit back to my ex-FIL's house in FL when I finally moved out.",
