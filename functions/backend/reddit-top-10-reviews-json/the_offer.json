        "content": "It's decent, but rather repetitive. I understand that there's alot of drama in productions that have problems stemming from BTS or outside reasons, but it felt a bulk of the episodes were \"Company loses faith in production, they get convinced otherwise\", then next episode \"Company loses faith in person on film and wants to fire, is convinced otherwise\". It really tells me it didn't need 10 episodes, could've been 6-8 at most if they focused up the story too. Personally, I wasn't interested in seeing the Colombo end of things, especially when they have to tweak with history to make it work in a story. I felt Colombo could've been a better guest appearance in the episode where he and Ruddy meet and make the deal about removing mafia from the script. Have him be an unseen threat, instead of seeing him plan the scare attack on Ruddy by shooting up his car, seeing his car abruptly shot up would've worked way better.\n\nThere's a few instances where an episode felt it was at a perfect end point then the episode kept going. I think I noticed this more in episode 6.\n\nAs well, I also started feeling like Paramount was constantly patting itself on the back with references to other hits of theirs. In a movie about the making of The Godfather, I didn't really need to see scenes of them talking about Chinatown, or The Great Gatsby. Love Story made slight sense as Robert Evans was married to Ali McGraw at that point so reference to that makes sense, but other than that the namedropping was a bit eyerolling.\n\nIn the latest episode there was a scene of Evans talking about what the audience needs to see and what they should give them. It rings a bit hollow when a month or so ago, the same studio unveiled a slew of reboots and sequels and remakes of their old films, one of them being Love Story.\n\nOutside of that, I still enjoy seeing the ins and outs of working on a set, the acting is pretty great, Matthew Goode as Evans especially. It's nowhere near a bad show but I don't see myself rewatching it after the finale.",

And why cast Lou Ferrigno as Luca Brasi's actor, and not even give that any screen time! Weird decisions when the history is ripe for drama, but i think its worth a watch for sure",

I think many of the actors (especially the ones portraying Bob Evans and Pacino) are great and I will never understand why Giovanni Ribisi isn't a much bigger star as he makes you fully believe his character regardless of how varied they are from his other rolls. I am a fan of the Godfather trilogy but have only seen it twice in my life with decades between viewings so I am not getting the easter eggs I'm sure they are dropping.  I also wasn't familiar with the story behind the making of the film so I don't know how much is true but it's interesting nonetheless.  Why do so many people seem to hate the actor who plays Ruddy? I don't really keep up with celebrity news. He does seem like he's trying too hard or something? Can't put my finger on it. I couldn't tell you the first thing about the real Ruddy so idk if that's just the character?",

Wednesday\", her exact lines from the movie. And this is just one example. As if the entire movie was created by this little coincidences that just happened to happen during the production. It disconnects me entirely, and it feels like I am watching a parody making of of the movie. \n\nAlso the guy playing Coppolla is way way off. The guy playing Pacino is good just for the looks, but does nothing otherwise. The guy playing Brando though, that was a top choice.",

For example, they fix Luca Brasi\u2019s actor\u2019s performance within a minute of the issue being brought up. They just clip along from trivia point to trivia point with no realistic dialogue and moments in between.\n\nThere are no real profound moments mining a scene for deeper meaning. A larger parallel about the elements of family/ corruption/ power and influence could have been weaved in, instead, it\u2019s all very surface-level.\n\nI\u2019m gonna savour the last three episodes. After having seen so many films/ interviews of cast and crew, it\u2019s quite a pleasure just to watch the performances of the recognisable faces and imagine what it must really have been like. As if the show is just to nudge the imagination and provide context clues for a bit of mental time-travel.\n\nI wonder if they were hoping to do a season around Godfather Part II?",
