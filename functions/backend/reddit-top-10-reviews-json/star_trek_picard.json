Space was gorgeous. Finally resolved Data. Bad guy was sinister. Experienced what it's like to *be* Borg, really hammering home their tragedy. And then Picard finding a real home in the end. It felt like the decades of investment into these characters finally paid off; the real gift from Matalas.\n\nWithout that baggage, I would say SNW is the reason why I'm a fan. I may have liked the movies, but this introduces everything that I didn't know I was missing from them, like Starfleet idealism and the feeling of exploring and being the first humans to experience things, now in 4K Dolby Vision.

It comes across as just trying to appease fans by showing off stuff from past shows; when I think of season 3, I just imagine Terry Matalas shouting \u201cLook at me, I brought back the entire TNG cast! Look at me, I brought back the Borg! Look at me, I brought back the Enterprise D! I debuted an Enterprise G! Please let me make Legacy!!!\u201d\n\nThe other seasons of Picard, and the other current shows have their problems, sure, but they\u2019re at least trying new things or trying to get interesting ideas across. Even Lower Decks, which is often accused of being \u201cthe nostalgia bait show\u201d generally uses its nostalgic references to further the development of its original characters and themes about the importance of blue collar workers. \n\nPersonally, season one of Prodigy has been my favourite new Star Trek so far; it balances its references to past trek carefully, while still having compelling, optimistic stories with new characters. And it does that in such a way that it can both ease new viewers into the lore of Star Trek gently, whilst providing a whole fresh perspective for long-time fans. \n\nAgain, I *get* the appeal of Picard season 3, and I enjoyed most of it a lot as it was coming out, but the more I think about it in retrospect, the more I find it disappointing and honestly kind of unambitious. Terry Matalas is great at giving the fans what they want, and that\u2019s fantastic. But the other shows have given me aspects and interpretations of Star Trek I didn\u2019t know I wanted, and introduced me to whole viewpoints and concepts I didn\u2019t know I needed.",

The only objective Matalas had was to make sure to put the old crew on the Enterprise one last time and have them save the day and the entire plot of the season contorts and warps around that one single objective in the dumbest way possible because they also had to write around the availability of the old actors as well as covid restrictions. \n\nYet another conspiracy inside Starfleet is working to kill/get the offspring of a former crewmate for their nefarious plans.\n\nLike the series finale of Enterprise, the TNG crew swoops in to hijack yet another series\u2019 well-deserved culmination. It\u2019s a shame, because many people really grew fond of the crew of La Sirena and one season of them doing a proper Firefly-esque thing getting into good trouble going where Starfleet can\u2019t would have been awesome to watch. Instead we get them locked onto a set so dark, you\u2019d think a Terran designed it for their eye comfort. \n\nThis would have worked fantastically as a streaming movie special (just like These Are the Voyages would have made an amazing tv movie half a year after the proper end of Enterprise), but as a ten hour season it overstays its welcome by about six episodes. \n\nAnd on top of that, the season is thematically confused. \nAre the Borg a trans-allegory (Matalas mentioned that when talking about Shaw deadnaming Seven)? Or are they a metaphor for fascist ideology brainwashing kids over the internet? Who knows?\nThe new characters are uninspired. \nWhite Sisko crowbarred into the season to make room for Matalas old buddy from Twelve Monkeys is superfluous to the plot and takes away precious screen time that should have been used to give space to Seven and Picard\u2019s relationship (have Seven deal with the consequences to her ship after agreeing to help Picard, or force her to make a tough choice). \n\nJack is a walking talking McGuffin who\u2019s badly cast being at least 15 years to old for the role. \n\nGeordi\u2019s daughters are barely characters with agency. \n\nData\u2019s and Q\u2019s revivals undercut their respective and somber deaths in the first two seasons. \n\nDeanna gets some good action moments in the finale but once again has to be bad at her job of counselling so the plot doesn\u2019t instantly resolve itself when she meets Jack after having to be kept away from the crew so her powers don\u2019t get in the way. \n\nBeverly\u2019s decision to keep Jack away from JL doesn\u2019t make any sense (at least Carol Marcus and Jim Kirk agreed to what they did) once he quits Starfleet (doing dangerous volunteering with a toddler in tow (did she like accelerate age him or something?) vs chilling in France). \n\nWorf does a bad job handling Raffi so she is forced to go it alone so Worf can have his hero moment to come in and save her from a problem of his own making. \n\nThe complete waste of time that is Vadic\u2019s story arc of her being a victim of Section 31 experimentation and now being coerced to help the Borg Queen with her cockamamy scheme and being reduced to a mere henchwoman without any agency with faceless nameless stooges for crew (I swear that scene in Crisis Point II: Paradoxus feels like it\u2019s making direct fun of this). \n\nThe pointless Easter eggs that do nothing for the story and only prompt more questions about what the hell is going on at Starfleet Headquarters these days. \n\nBut most of all: it is unbecoming of Trek to force our main characters into a situation where diplomacy and understanding aren\u2019t even considered as a solution to the problem and Data and Beverly and other express hate and disgust for the Borg as a whole when they\u2019re actually victims of the Borg Queen and the system they got trapped in which the first two seasons of Picard spent serious time reiterating. \n\nAnd it\u2019s a shame that this season now will likely be the last stuff they all get to be remembered for. It\u2019s better than Nemesis, but not a lot, and that movie at least had some interesting themes and was over after two hours.",

The season started well and the first 5 episodes were short of OK (Picard was looking for a key!!), but then, we got back to the Borg, to silliness, to copying Star Wars and the rest.  So, not good, beyond getting the chance to say goodbye to the TNG cast.  So, it just \"boils\" in the same cauldron with all the Star Trek \"garbage\" that has been produced since 2013. \n\nNone of this is a surprise.  Hollywood simply does not have the writers that can write decent sci-fi.  For sci-fi, one needs to have a vision and to want to tell an amazing story.  The typical Hollywood hacks who get assembled to write these shows have absolutely no vision and do not have any ideas.  They watch some of the old shows and then they write a silly story.  They believe that the fans will flock there anyway, irrespective of the silliness.",

The first episode was pretty good, and the moments Picard shares with Q and the scenes on the Stargazer are pretty good. There's a few really good diamonds in the rough, surrounded with a sea of nonsense that derails the plot completely. There were several points in Season 2 where I thought \"what the hell is even going on?\" As lame as S1 was, it didn't have this problem, it was very consistent in its presentation.\n\n I'm willing to bet Season 2 was originally meant to be much shorter, but the Paramount execs wanted to have a long season so they could drag out people's subscriptions to Paramount Plus for a long time, just like what Disney did to the Kenobi show. The reason the 'in between' scenes suck so much is because they were hastily written in between an already written script or a script draft, so what we got was watered down.",

It needs to find its Andor moment as a modern franchise. Maybe Strange New Worlds is just about good enough for now, I dunno.",

CG was great overall ...but Star Fleet having a single class of star ship was absolutely weird, and also like the one point I'd totally have expected to see cameos in the form of like some Intrepids, Akiras and Lunas(iirc this was explained as an actual production issue, they wanted to, but had no models in useable formats available and couldn't do them in time). The crew grew on me. I remember a lot of puking which was weird.\n\nS2 I only saw parts of, but that's mostly as ST episodes travelling to \"our\" time just aren't my thing, neither are the alternate universe episodes. The allusions to US political & societal issues were rather hamfisted, with ICE etc. But I guess so were older 90s episodes doing similar, I just didn't know what they alluded to.\n\nI'm mostly a DS9 guy \ud83d\ude05 and of the newer series only LD did some homages to that.",
