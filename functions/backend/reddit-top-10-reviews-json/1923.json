Literally nothing at all held my interest even remotely.  Jack and Elizabeth are as dull as can be.  Jacob and Cara are perfectly fine, but nothing there was very interesting or compelling.   Teonna's story has legs but it is so repulsive on one level that it's not something I want to dwell on.  Whitfield and Banner are ordinary bad guys, kind of meh -- nothing I haven't seen before 1000 times.",

        "content": "Let me add, I think it's modern in terms of the photography.\n\nI think it was unusual to do photography of people outside of a formal photo studio. You know the style I mean right? Man sitting very straight in a very uncomfortable chair, wife standing with hand on his shoulder. Even camera shots outside the studio were generally very often stiff and posed.\n\nThis was mainly because of how bulky the old cameras were. They were really meant to be used with a tripod which made a natural pose for photos hard to execute.\n\nSo its unusually modern to have a photo done outside of a studio in a style where the subject is in a more natural pose or doing some action. I know she's posed looking up while fake writing something in a workbook but it's still more natural than sitting straight looking forward. Not to mention the class setting with other people out of the prime depth of field behind her. Not something you see a lot of in old photos.",

Most ads and things like the Sears catalog would have used illustrations or paintings. Illustrated and painted magazine covers were quite common even into the 1950s.\n\nTime magazine used lots of illustrated covers in this time period and magazines with lots of photos weren't all that common until Time purchased and relaunched Life magazine in the mid-1930s.\n\nWe're in 2022.
