So... take what's shown on screen with a grain of salt. While I'm glad Bass Reeves is getting more attention since the dude was a stone cold badass, this series is not biopic, it's historical fiction.",

Bass' story in the series starts with him beating the everliving *fuck* out of the 11th Texas' commanding officer before escaping to Indian country in 1862, so probably the last we'll hear of the Confederates for a while, although I feel like Barry Pepper's \"Esau\" will pop back up and reminisce about the war a bit later.\n\nIn reality, although we know that Bass was forced to accompany his master to war with the 11th Texas, that's all we know. We don't know what engagements he was present at, or how / when he gained his freedom.",

The Reeves family lives in Van Buren and much of the story takes place there. \n\nIt\u2019s an adaptation of a novel about Reeves so it takes some artistic liberties, but I\u2019ve read the Art Burton books. The adaptation \u2018feels real\u2019 which is about all you can reasonably expect out of Hollywood. David Oyelowo is great as Bass.\n\nMuch of the action takes place in Oklahoma/Indian Territory, not Arkansas, but that\u2019s accurate. That\u2019s where Bass spent most of his time enforcing the law. \n\nMy one objection is the casting of 88 yo Donald Sutherland as Judge Parker. Parker was 58 when he died of Bright\u2019s disease. I like Sutherland a lot as an actor but he was wrong for it. \n\nI don\u2019t expect a second season. The Lawmen is supposed to feature a different lead character/historical lawman each season.",

        "content": "I agree with everything you say, except early 1930s. The ambush origin story didn't happen until 1938, for the first Lone Ranger movie serial. He was just a guy in a mask who fought evil for some reason for the first five years of his existence. \n\nAnd Tom Mix, in that he was the action cowboy hero of the time, but the similarities end mostly there. \n\nBut we are in total agreement, Bass Reeves wouldn't have been an inspiration because the Ranger was a weird, piecemeal invention of a bunch of ignorant city slickers who never would have known better.",
