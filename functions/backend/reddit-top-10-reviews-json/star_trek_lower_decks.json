So I wrote it off for a while and never watched more.\n\nBut more recently I saw some people speak well of it, so I figured I'd give it another chance... and now I like it. Surprisingly, despite how silly it can be, it still feels pretty Star Trek-y to me, somehow. I think it being animated lets me forgive the silliness more easily than I can with a live action space scifi show.",

There are no messages that feel forced in the show, the characters are all well written, and the story is very entertaining.

Sure it was cool seeing the references, but the humor didn\u2019t work for me at all. To me that crew is unprofessional and not very Starfleet at all. It irked me that for every reference they made, the characters would say or do something that\u2019s not very Trek. \n\nI want to point out though that I didn\u2019t grow up watching The Simpsons, or Family Guy, or Spongebob and so that humor has never really interested me as an adult which is probably a huge part of it.\n\nI will say though, if Lower Decks isn\u2019t your jam like with me, try Prodigy. It definitely skews younger as a family show that kids can watch with their Trek loving parents, but later on in the show it becomes VERY Star Trek, with references to previous shows, cameos, and some top notch SciFi story telling. \u201cTime Amok\u201d is particularly good as a scifi story, while the ending is fantastic as a Trek story.",

Whatever it is that I enjoy in Trek seems to be missing.\n\nPeople keep telling me \"it gets better\" so I might give it another shot one day but I'm pretty pessimistic (a whole season seems like a more than reasonable shot to give).\n\nI'm glad it found an audience though. As long as the franchise lives on there's a chance they do other similar yet different stuff and something I like is produced (I have yet to see Prodigy for ex.).",

After the succes that WAS Rick and Morty, suddenly everybody has to do this cringey type of humour, and its just not funny anymore if ever it was.\nNear the end, you feel like the show is flayling away, trying to appeal to a whole range of audiences and it just doesnt hold up anymore.\n\nGlad if you enjoy it, but its not for me",

For that reason, it just isn't that meaningful or interesting.\n\nSo it's OK, but to understand what is going on you have to be 100% glued to it and pay close attention, and you won't remember it much after because it's just pure sugar for your brain (as far as content goes).\n\nUltimately, I feel like I am not the target audience.

I was also worried about the fact that it seemed to be a slob comedy like Family Guy, but they've avoided that trap - despite the comedy, the crew of the Cerritos are decent people.  I'm actually starting to relax and let myself enjoy this.",

That's where it really hit its stride. The first two episodes of Lower Decks suck ass. And Boimler during his Ensign Kiss Ass phase almost makes the show unwatchable. But like all the main cast, he goes through a lot of character development and by season two he is one of the strongest characters. Once he starts focusing on just being a good officer, he becomes a lot more compelling. Like Mariner after she starts going to therapy.",

And that white nerd dude was always wrong and even when he was right he was wrong and everyone justly hated him for it. So I was bored to tears with how they felt the need to hammer this over and over without the slightest subtlety, cleverness, or nuance, but as a white nerd dude, I also didn't want to say anything that could be misinterpreted as \"I don't want to watch this show because it makes fun of white nerd dudes\". Luckily my wife said \"I don't like this show, can we stop watching it.\" and I agreed.",

There are some good episodes, but there some bad ones that are also veeerrryyyyy long. I'm sorry but all together I cannot point at the Trek show that is worse then it.

But by season two he's developed into a confident officer.\n\nSeason one Mariner actually starts going to therapy towards the end of the season and noticeably works past some of her issues.\n\nOne of the show's main strenghts is the way the characters are constantly growing and improving.",

        "content": "Yes, it definitly was differnt in a pretty unexpected way. Tbh., i don't like Andor. It was different, but still just a copy-saldabar of popular series like Altered Carpon, so it is some random space-noir crime thingy with easy accsess for StarWars people.\n\nI grew up with SW and loved it, but learned erlay that a brand is never your friend, or care in any way about the quality or consistence of the art they once produced. So every SW product had to be good as a lone standing thing to me. And allready the new movies with Jaja Binks make me quit pretty hard. There where no SW anymore, and it prevented my of whsifull thinking that ther can be anything like this, desperatly watching through month of horrible garbage, just to find that beloved childhood memory.\n\nSame with StarTrek. You have that age, and its fine, and then you grew up and move on. Everything fine.\n\nIt unfortunatly has become a market theme and buisness managment/producer rule that existing brands are good money cows, so they buy in and ruin them all in the very same procedute that totally makes sense for them. When the thing then inevitable fails, people start fighting about broken loyality of other fans, all kinds of ism's and all that nonsense. It becomes muddy water, and the producers get away with ther strategy to ruin the next thing. So yeah, pretty much what you said with the Marvel-syndrom.  \n\n\nPS: Let me personally add why i wasn't pleased by Andor not only because it was a kitbash of other storys who has been told better. It wasen't StarWars. It had the backround and all that, but it could be a random WildWest or anything backround and not much had to change.  \nA childish, no-disciplin moron is portraied to get away with anything, bypassing planetary controls by garbage-tech easily, but fail to act responsibly or strategical in any way at the same time. He get into the initial trouble for not spend a single thought on what he's doing here - or do it a consequent way, in which those guards would either never be found, or found with heavy drug abuse and instable memory and no clear memory at all. A thousend options, but they decided for lazy writing. And so it started with a extrem slow, pointless and random story and flat, stereotype personalitys i failed to follow in the first place - even people told me it gets better later. Yeah, maybe, but if this charakter is the foundation of your story, i know soemthing about your writing and about your idea of what propper person/plott/telling is.  \nA series that need a handfull of episodes to tell me why i'm watching this, someone is pretty arrogant in his belive i ***had*** to watch this. That's the reason people watched Lost or such nonsense. The audience is done with this type of cheap manipulation - or should be. So the whole thing is some kind of insult to the intelect to me, which whights much higher than any technical critique i might have about it.",

But over the course of the season I felt that that actually improved a lot. Mariner was revealed to be a screwup on a number of occasions, and Boimler turned out to be in the right. There was even one episode where Boimler knew exactly how Mariner would think and act and used that to end up as the wise \"puppetmaster\" ensuring that everything worked out okay by knowing exactly how Mariner was going to screw everything up.\n\nAnd by the end of season 2 there's a big plot twist setting up something really cool to come with Boimler in season 3 that I'm really looking forward to.\n\nAlso, over the course of the show it becomes less focused on just Boimler and Mariner. Rutherford and Tendi become just as prominent (the other two characters in the linked screenshot), and I dearly love both of those characters so any episodes featuring them were a treat.\n\nEven the bridge crew ends up getting a fair bit of development. :)",

LD is not enriching anything and frankly is not funny at all. I watch it out of compromise really because I don't want to miss a thing, and a ten is still home for me, but I like none of the characters and almost everything that happens seems pointless. Having said that if it makes some people happy in happy it's it there, enjoy it...

I felt like the final arc of season 3 felt like it could stand with some of the best Trek arcs while still being lighthearted and fun.

The humour is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of theoretical physics most of the jokes will go over a typical viewer's head. There's also Rick's nihilistic outlook, which is deftly woven into his characterisation- his personal philosophy draws heavily from Narodnaya Volya literature, for instance. The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these jokes, to realise that they're not just funny- they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike Rick & Morty truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn't appreciate, for instance, the humour in Rick's existential catchphrase \"Wubba Lubba Dub Dub,\" which itself is a cryptic reference to Turgenev's Russian epic Fathers and Sons. I'm smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as Dan Harmon's genius wit unfolds itself on their television screens. What fools.. how I pity them. \ud83d\ude02\n\nAnd yes, by the way, i DO have a Rick & Morty tattoo. And no, you cannot see it.

The first 3-5 episodes had 2 scripts one with the tone similar to season 2 one more comedic and fox kept going for the comedic side and wanting the jokes to be punched up.  He asked for 2-3 episodes where he got to run his script and they had higher approval numbers.  That\u2019s how he was able to shift from the comedy to light comedy more story driven events.\n\nAlso originally he wasn\u2019t the captain he was going to play an admiral and fox required him to be the captain.",

Their most distinctive feature is that they can split into three parts (legs, torso, and head) that fly around independently of each other. But one of their lesser known features is that due to the shoddy animation standards of the original Animated Series we don't actually know how many fingers they have. In some scenes they were animated with three fingers on each hand, in other scenes they were animated with four fingers on each hand. Different artists handled each scene and they didn't worry too much about keeping details like that consistent, I guess.\n\nFast forward to the Lower Decks and a Pandronian appears as a guest star for an episode. If you pay attention to her fingers, sure enough, in some scenes she's got three and in other scenes she's got four. It *had* to be deliberate, modern animation like Lower Decks is done on a computer so you don't \"accidentally\" use two completely different models like that.\n\nCredit to the TrekCulture review of that episode for pointing that out to me.",

Part of the fun watching scifi (especially older scifi) is to see the practical effects mixed practical effects and post principle photography manipulation.

It is just a constant \"whatever you can think of is animated\" and this simply reduces  the wow factor.",

They may dress it up a bit too much with action but I think we're finally seeing something that is close to original trek. \n\nThat also includes some silliness, some camp. It's really hard to modernize the old episodic formula  because you can't just bring it back as it was. We don't want it to be grimdark ultra drama either. So overall, I am very glad to see how they are threading the needle, it's the only good new trek in my opinion. It's flaws kind of enhance it in the same way as old trek while still feeling distinctly new and not an homage. It's nice to sincerely enjoy something and also poke fun at it in the same way I did with every show up until \"enterprise\" (which is where I stopped enjoying trek as much, personally).\n\nEdit: given the context of this thread, I should mention I haven't seen lower decks yet. But I don't think a comedy will ever scratch the itch by nature (especially not what I've seen from the Orville, which I just don't find funny).",

It starts poorly, but it\u2019s worth getting through the rough start. I think it *does* show that old trek works no problem today. I don\u2019t see why you\u2019re convinced the old formula needs to be majorly revamped. If you were doing the old approach with good actors, the only modernizing you\u2019d need to do would be to use contemporary effects, better visuals, basically what they\u2019ve done visually. I don\u2019t get why that wouldn\u2019t play without issue. It\u2019s not like rewatching ds9 makes me think \u201cthey sure did have some antiquated ideas of how to tell a good story back then.\u201d",

For one, it created a challenging situation for odo and explored the strong desire for one to learn who they came from, even if they\u2019re not good people. It resolved a long running arc with the cardassians, showing them reap what they sewed and showing the rewards of such selfish greed and hatred. You had the gem hadar and their chemical slavery, exploring issues of drug addiction etc. You had lots of xenophobia, and how xenophobia of the breen and founders became their undoing. I mean, shit, what of the dominion war wasn\u2019t a backdrop for moralistic issues and various lessons? It showed the harm starfleets meddling could cause for less fortunate planets like bajor. Plenty with the klingons and navigating an ally that wants war more than peace, though I don\u2019t think the klingon side stories were great here. Did you really think the entire purpose of the domion war was an episode or two of poor \u201caction\u201d even though the story line ran for like two+ seasons?",

They are a product of their times, the writing would feel stilted, the characters would feel hollow. It would be a poor facsimile or something that reminds you of trek. Personally, I think what I described doesn't sound like a major revamp. It's identifying the elements that worked and acknowledging that they should be approached from a fresh angle. Humor, for example, a level of campy earnestness from the writers (something that is almost impossible to do on purpose). I think my point was to say that they are mostly using the old formula, but not in a cookie cutter kind of way. Sad to hear that s2 will probably not grow from there, but I'm happy this show exists in general. \n\nI will check out lower decks! I'm not avoiding it, I'm actually rewatching all of trek with my wife, we started watching ToS when dating and it's her first time through. We're at voyager now. So I decided to hold off on some of the new stuff to watch with her for the first time. What I meant to say about comedy-trek is that I think it is in its own category. I saw another user on this thread complain that lower decks trivialize old trek plots, but even without seeing it I feel that is a strange comment to levy at a comedy. It has a different focus, it's not trying to achieve the same goals for the viewer.",

I can't and I won't defend Berman, but I will defend the shows in spite of him.\n\nI think you're either missing or ignoring the point I'm trying to make. Even the video you linked lauds Ira Steven Behr and admits that TNG was good even if in spite of Berman. Those 3-4 shows in the 1980-2000s revitalized the franchise and continued the progressive legacy of Star Trek. \n\nIt's that legacy I'm talking about. It started with Roddenberry and was effectively continued by the likes of Behr. Even though Berman stood in the way of that, he did so unsuccessfully and Kurtzman is worse still.\n\nKurtzman's work simply doesn't hold up to that legacy. Worse still I don't think it's even trying to. All of the optimism and humanism of Star Trek is gone, it's now a generic grimdark sci-fi story with badly written \"progressive\" elements tacked on to meet quotas and marketing metrics rather than anyone actually holding progressive values.",

Then there was the (to me) overkill on the emotional content of the episodes. It just felt like every episode had to have 5-10 minutes of characters opening their hearts about how much they loved each other, even & especially during critical moments. It was like watching Star Trek 90210. Then, when they decided to change things again we had the previously shadowy Section 31 come out of the closet about 200 years too early and the shift to the future where the galaxy has been decimated by a bratty alien kid. It felt like it was written by a team who\u2019d barely watched any Trek and were just adapting scripts written for another show that never made it past the pilot.\n\nSome episodes were ok, but for me the vast majority were watch once & forget. To this day I\u2019ve never rewatched more than a handful.\n\nI\u2019ve watched the entire four season run of Lower Decks three times.

LD doesn't just feel like trek, it IS. Sure it's made in a funny way.  But good parodies are the ones that understand the point of the show. And LD does. All the little details are there for the fans, but the story in itself is full of what makes star trek what it is: stories of hope, friendship, solving problems together etc.\n\nOn the other hand there is Discovery. I like the show. But it was introduced as a way to get new people into the franchise. It's much more action and story based. That doesn't necessarily make it bad of course. But it is more classic sf in space, without that touch of star trek (i would say the last season was though).",

The Orville captured the hope and idealism of TNG.\n\nI really wanted to like Discovery.  The show was serious and dark and missing a lot of the fun elements of Star Trek. Season two fixed a lot of those issues and really developed the ensemble cast.... until the plot revolved around Burnham again. The character is the least interesting part of the show. I've tried multiple times to watch season three but can't get into it.\n\nLower Decks was hard to get into at first because of the fast talking and heavy comedy, but it either evened out or I got used to it. Like Orville it's a love letter to TNG and all Star Trek. It's fun to watch. \n\nAs an aside, maybe it's because I'm older.

        "content": "I don't want to hate too much on Discovery, if you're enjoying it.\n\nBut I find a lot of the stories in Discovery don't make sense or the big secrets end up being very conveniently connected to members of Discovery's crew. Without spoiling anything, I didn't like what the Red Angel turned out to be. And the source of The Burn didn't sit right with me. And I didn't like that Michael was Spock's never-mentioned-before adopted sister. Just a lot of conveniences.\n\nYou can explain away anything with science-fiction but overall I find that the show asks for too much suspension of disbelief from me.\n\nThe entire crew and their ship travel 900 years to the future. And they get to continue serving in Starfleet? If an engineer or sailor from 900 years ago turned up today on Earth, they wouldn't get to keep working - no amount of retraining would get them up to speed. The show handwaves away these kinds of things.\n\nNone of that matters if it's a good show but I found a lot of episodes to be a dull slow grind. And there's an air of smugness to the whole thing - the show feels like it's important and feels like we should buy into it, even when it doesn't work or doesn't make sense.\n\nAnd I really don't like Michael Burnham. She's a good actress - I've seen her in other things I've liked - so absolutely no disrespect to Sonequa Martin-Green. But Michael always knows what's going on, Michael breaks the rules to do what she wants, she's always so sure and smug, and almost completely serious and humorless. Again, this is not bad acting - these are all deliberate character choices (she grew up in Vulcan society so she turned out like this) but I just don't care for it - she doesn't have the competence to back it up.\n\nAnyway, a lot of this is subjective but that'd be my answer.\n\nOn the positive side, the pilot for Discovery was very good and very promising. I watched it 2 or 3 times when it was new. Pike was great on Discovery. And I think it was a good move to go to the future - it was exciting and the first few episodes of Season 3 delivered on that. I liked the period where Michael was alone with Book and they were exploring a new future.\n\nAs for Lower Decks, it's just a nice funny 20 minute adventure. I think its too heavy with the references and the early episodes did not work for me. But it's settled into something very fun with characters I care about.",

        "content": "Lower Decks is clearly made by people who know and love Star Trek.  They know every episode, of every series, backwards and forwards, and they love them all.  The good, and the bad.  Lower Decks has the same optimistic feel that TNG did- the belief that human beings will eventually go to the stars, and they'll hold to their morals while they do it.  That we'll grow past stupidity and selfishness, and become reasonable, intelligent species, exploring the galaxy and trying, always trying, to be a force for good.  Look at Mariner's speech in the most recent episode.  Even she, the most anti-establishment character in the series, says Starfleet isn't perfect but it always tries to do the right thing.\n\nDiscovery feels like it was made by people who either never watched Star Trek before, or watched it and full on hated it.  The characters don't generally comport themselves with the moral fortitude that characters in other series do.  The SETS don't even look like Star Trek.  Right from the very start, they're dark, dimly lit, and oppressive.  Look at Michael's trial, back in the beginning of season 1.  [It's a bunch of people standing around in a dark room.](https://www.therearefourmics.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Star-Trek-Discovery-2-Battle-at-the-Binary-Stars-Burnham-on-trial.jpg)  Lit by klieg lights, apparently.  No reasonable human being would try to hold a court proceeding that way.  [Contrast that with a trial from TOS.](https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Court_Martial_(episode)?file=Starbase_11_courtroom.jpg) \n\nDiscovery's aesthetics are wildly wrong for Star Trek.  The characterization is sad.  (Literally.  Everybody sits around crying.)  The overall plot is pessimistic.  The show's entire view of the future is just... dark.  And that's not what I want from Star Trek.\n\nLower Decks characters are shown with normal human foibles, but at the end of the day, they're competent, moral, and optimistic.  And that wins through.  Discovery's characters are a collection of depressed, morally ambiguous (At best) assholes.",

Disco just doesn\u2019t do that. There\u2019s nothing wrong with it, but it\u2019s a fork of Trek rather than part of the timeline.\n\nMeanwhile lower decks is the polar opposite; an absolute homage and insider sense of life in the core of the Federation at its peak. It\u2019s made for hardcore fans and appeals to them heavily.\n\nDifferent audiences!\n\nBear in mind though, in the 80s and 90s some people disliked TNG for very similar reasons. It isn\u2019t deeply planted in TOS and is safely far enough into the future not to have to be.\n\nI think Disco also, at least initially, maybe too dystopian, whereas Trek in general is rather utopian and has this huge sense of wide eyed optimism. Discovery returns to that, but only after a couple of series of feeling a lot more like a different genre of sci-fi.\n\nI don\u2019t dislike Discovery and it was in some ways a welcome departure. Often the Federation can be presented as a bit unrealistically polished - a bit too perfect. There\u2019s a slight saccharine patriotism to it at times that can grate a bit - can be interesting to see that departed from.",

The crew without her managed 98% of the episode to get out with team effort and it was the first time i started to care  just to get ruined  with the last two dialogs.  or there is only 13 episodes and we waste it with empress filler episodes",

Figured I'd catch it on a delay - buy a box set when the series finishes and form my opinion then. It didn't \"feel\" like Trek. (Only ended up watching because ex and I finished a watch-thru, and were curious about Picard).\n\nI once wrote fanfiction for NaNoWriMo.\n\nLower Decks feels like Mike McMahan went in my brain and made a series based on that. Lower Decks feels like Trek, made with love, and taking the piss out of it when deserved.\n\nThese are feelings. Me saying \"discovery didn't work because\" or \"these are the reasons I love Lower Decks\" are just that. Justification for a feeling that came first.\n\nPS:  we could let her daughter stay up late and watch any episode of Trek with us. When we watched Disco and Picard, we had to wait until she was put to bed because it was too violent.",

Not a single plot thread has a satisfactory resolution. I never bothered with the later seasons. Maybe it got better, but the same people were in charge, and there's so much other television to watch, so I never really saw the need. Had a similar experience with S1 of Picard .\n\nLower Decks I'm not really a fan of, but from what I watched, it wasn't actively awful television. The humor didn't do anything for me, but it at least didn't feel like the writers thought I was a moron. If nothing else, comedy shows just come with different expectations. They aren't *supposed* to be taken too seriously, and that applies to both the writers and the viewers. The writers aren't chasing \"drama\" to the detriment of everything else, and the viewers won't mind some rough edges so long as the humor lands.",

        "content": "In my opinion, there are two major differences that makes LD feel more trek-like than Discovery (and mind, I like both shows, I just find LD more trek-like).\n\nFirst, Lower Decks is episodic.  There are character arcs, but I could sit down and watch any episode at any point and not really have to worry about what came before.  Discovery is definitely more of a serial tale where you are kind of forced to watch the entire season to get it.  There are exceptions in both shows, but that's basically the trend.\n\nSecondly, Discovery is very much one person's story.  It is the Michael Burnham show.  And that's fine, to a point, but Star Trek has always been more of a ensemble show, and Lower Decks does that better, for sure.  In Discovery, I didn't even really know the names of the bridge crew until late second season.  I still have to work to remember any of them except Detmer and Saru.  Compared to LD, when there are relatively minor characters I can name easily like Billups and Migliamoo (the latter's spelling may be off, but that's how I picture the name).  Everyone's had moments to shine and as such, I know and care about the entire cast.\n\nIf there are other things you care about, that make the show feel like Trek to you, your decision may vary.  That's what makes fandoms great, though, in my opinion.  We can have different ideas and yet, it all still works.",

I do like that animation is growing in the franchise with Lower Decks and Prodigy. You have more relatable characters in Lower Decks I think than Discovery, not say there isn\u2019t any on that show. Discovery had its fair share of problems but I think it\u2019s improved over the last couple of years. It\u2019s a show that boldly went to the small screen in a time when no Star Trek show had aired for 12 years. It\u2019s gonna have its bad moments and good moments. The show\u2019s gotta learn how to walk straight instead of zigzagging. I believe it has with trying to reconnect the Federation in the 32nd century (don\u2019t remember what season).",

It knows what it wants to achieve and does it well.\n\nWhile Discovery is basically the Michael Burnham show. And I just don't like her much as a character. That in and of itself wouldn't be a problem. I disliked characters from other StarTrek shows before and it didn't impact my enjoyment of those much, because they were ensemble shows full of various different premises (like LD is). I could just ignore/not watch the parts I didn't like. But with Disco that's impossible, because everything in every story always has to be tied back to her as a character or be ultimately solved by her.\nThere is pretty much no liking Disco without liking Michael and this also makes the stories kind of boring to watch by themselves, because you are mostly just waiting for her to spit out the solution and then jet of to another personal-crisis. It's repetitive and unimaginative and that's really just a death knell for any StarTrek show.",

At its best, it's a tightly plotted, action-packed sci-fi thriller. It focuses much more on conflict, drama, strong emotions, and showy action scenes than any TV Trek, it's much more in spirit of J. J. Abrams' Trek films.",

Just use the new suit you idiots!\n\nSeason 3: Completely ignoring the completely impossible internal structure of the discovery, the heroes only survive because the main villain, who we are told and have seen kill everyone who gets in her way or fails her, doesn't kill them when she really, really should have.\n\nSeason 4: Completely unrelated beings from another galaxy have brain chemicals that are exactly the same as humans, and are also somehow the basis of a language.\n\nThose are just the big ones that I could remember off the top of my head.

That said, I'm not sure it had much choice. The original concept sandwiched it to a place that possibly limited storytelling. It was a bold plan.

        "author": "Independent-Shirt698",
        "content": "For me, I think there's a couple of important points here. Firstly, lower decks doesn't really take itself too seriously, whereas I feel discovery really does. Star trek has never taken itself that seriously, look at all the subtle jokes and such throughout the older series, just to give one example, a personal favorite:  \nQ (attempting to convince the bridge crew he is now mortal): What must I do to convince you people?  \nWorf: Die  \nRiker: \\*tries to keep a straight face\\*  \nAnyways, my point being star trek has always had some levity and joviality, which I feel is rather absent from discovery and the newer shows. Lower decks is the exception to that. While it certainly goes beyond the treks that have gone before, I feel it does it in a tasteful way. It's not really meant to be a \"true\" trek, it's effectively a show designed to play off all the injokes and such from the fandom. The guys who originally came up with it as an idea aren't the normal show writers from paramount either, they are long time trek fans that really get what makes the old treks great.   \nDiscovery, on the other hand, feels like the writers really don't get what used to make trek great, and don't particularly care. If I was being skeptical about it I'd say they saw the trek name as an easy way to get people interested and get themselves some money. There certainly not doing it out of a love for what has gone before.   \nMy biggest gripe with discovery, and really all the new treks, is they don't really make much of an effort to seamlessly interface with the previous treks. They've come in and changed it all up, which makes it feel like it doesn't belong in the same universe as the older treks. And before anyone says I'm just against the woke nature of the newer treks, I'm not. Trek was \"woke\" long before being woke was a thing. That's fine to an extent. What I will say is look back at the older treks, they're a lot more subtle in there portrayal of this side of things. They're not in your face about it, and they never outright make the point they're actually making, but if you watch it with your brain in gear you'll notice some distinct parallels between the onscreen events they discuss and real world events. New trek is, sadly, a lot less subtle, and seems to just try to ram things down your throat. It's not great, but tbh, it's not a huge issue for me. My bigger problem with newer trek is the aesthetic changes. Both DISC and SNW are supposed to be set before TOS, and yet, the ships seen in both series look waaaaaaaay more modern than what we see in TOS, with no explanation. I get that they want to make it look futuristic for audiences of the day, but at the same time, there's ways you could bring things up to modern standards without just completely changing the aesthetic styling. So, instead of trying to fit in with what's gone before, someone has made the conscious decision to go against what's gone before, and that's seen throughout a lot of the new stuff. They're deliberately trying to change things up so that it doesn't line up with what's gone before, and that, frankly, just doesn't sit right with me. If you're going to add to an existing franchise, you really should try to remain consistent with the established universe, or at least have a way to explain the inconsistencies. I don't like the Kelvin timeline, but at least they had an explanation for why things looked and felt different, being an alternate timeline and all.   \n\n\nAnyways, I think that's my rant over for the day.",

Not only does it emulate the style, but it loves to pay homage to that era, too. It plays heavily on fan nostalgia. It wants to make you think of the old shows when you watch it.\n\nDiscovery, particularly its first season, tried to modernise everything, with little concern about how it fitted in with the older shows. Just look at the Klingons; not just a physical redesign to the species, but all their ships had a completely new design language. It wasn't concerned about how holographic comms didn't fit in with the era as we already knew it. It was practically a soft-reboot. Its made more of an effort to integrate itself into the larger continuity since, but also by launching itself 1000 years into the future, it has further separated itself from prior eras.",

It also really bugs me when non fans shit on other fans because Why?? Just let people enjoy the show.  \n\n\nWith that being said, I agree with alot of your dislikes of the show and the reasons why. The biggest problem for me was Adira going on a big rant about being trans to Stammets and how they have been called her their whole life when they are actually they. This was clearly a rant for a trans person in 2020 being said by a person circa 3100.  \n\n\nIt's 2023 and trans rights are already being talked about and slowly being normalized, and codified into law. You're telling me that  over a THOUSAND years from now this is still an issue, I thought that a better way of doing this would be for Stammets to mis-gender Adira, Adira then corrects him and he says \"Oh, sorry about that, won't happen again\" Nice and easy, because that's how it SHOULD be.   \n\n\nAgain, not trying to shit on the show too much, but I couldn't help but be reminded of the interview with Gene Rodenberry when he was asked about why Picard wouldn't try to regrow his hair and he said \"Because in the 24th century, no one would care\". I'm not trying to equate trans rights to male baldness, but just saying that I would imagine that people in 3100 wouldn't care about trans stuff because it would be SO normalized by then.",

If the Klingons involved themselves in the development of a planet, the Prime Directive had to go out the window.  Things usually still worked out, but not always, as with this Gene Roddenberry written episode...\n\nhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Private_Little_War\n\nhttps://youtu.be/EshCDHdikz8?si=qYFi6U_2f_ZaPKz0\n\nSometimes, Starfleet turned pacifist natives into killers determined to wipe out the enemy in an escalating arms race.  So much for utopia and wide eyed optimism.  But, that's the 23rd Century for you.  The vision for the future they're trying to achieve is utopian, but the reality they exist in is this...\n\nhttps://youtu.be/ULCfivE7x94?si=2kdZqT10Box_U83_\n\nhttps://youtu.be/wfYoaOL0_Ig?si=t7wM_QEFFvxdjppe\n\nTo portray 23rd Century Starfleet as its 24th Century self would have been a massive continuity error.  The 23rd Century is the way it is in Discovery and Strange New Worlds because that's how it was in the original series.  \n\nIn the TNG era, they've achieved those goals... at least until the Borg showed up.",

DS9 allowed Brooks to change his hair, so he could wear it shaved like he personally prefers it and Enterprise had enough problems with Archer as a captain on it's own.

Of course, that's going to create some issues when you have someone with a different vision take over halfway through the season.\n\nMy biggest issue with Discovery and Picard is the need for some apocalyptic threat, every season.  Stakes don't always have to be on that level.  Look at the Star Wars shows set around the time period of The Mandalorian.  Three seasons of The Mandalorian, one season of The Book of Boba Fett, and one season of Ahsoka, and they've just now finally gotten around to the high stakes threat to the galaxy.

I'm hoping that part of the point of S2's ending cliffhanger is to have Beckett have to start to grow up some, without entirely losing that \"Damn the Torpedoes!\" mindset that makes her both fun and frequently irritating....",

I didn't like Enterprise, I've yet to watch Picard, Discovery, or Strange New Worlds. Mainly because I rarely watch TV or movies these days for various reasons. \n\nI wanted to try out something totally new to Trek since the original animated series. I started with Prodigy, and it  isn't too bad, outside of the annoying main character. It definitely feels tailored to attract a younger audience and a larger appeal as with Star Wars. I dont like Star Wars, but I rather do enjoy Prodigy for what it is. \n\nNow Lower Decks? Damn am I in love! The cast is great, the setting of the TNG era of Trek is spot on, and also the era I grew up watching and what made me a fan of Trek in the first place. \n\nI was initially skeptical since it was based on comedy, but once I made it halfway through the 1st episode, I was hooked. \n\nLower Decks seems to get a bit of hate, but I feel it's uncalled for. Trek fans have a handful of new shows, so they won't all appeal to fans. Sure, some of the humor seems forced, but I've found myself genuinely laughing out loud on quite a few occasions. \n\nI hope Lower Decks becomes a long standing and beloved show as so many before it. \n\nLower Decks gets \ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4d from me!",

The characters are not very likable or interesting so far if I\u2019m being honest. They are all very one dimensional. I like the cyborg guy at least. I find him sweet and a little amusing, and the grumpy cat doctor is kind of neat but everyone else can buzz off. The art style of skiny humans with large heads, animated with motion tweens, is away over done and unpleasant to me. The style is very common in streaming show series like Botbots and Inside Job from Netflix or HouseBroken on Fox. Shows that have many seasons for the sake of streaming but no real enjoyment value for me. (Although I am lying if I said I did not think Botbots was adorable). Maybe I am too critical of shows. I just watch these shows when I have nothing else to watch and need something to waste my time on and once I finish binging one show, I never think about them again because they\u2019re just not memorable.",

She regularly attacks and wounds people and she essentially murders a new life form in just the first few eps. This makes it like an attempt to copy Rick+Morty for the Star Trek franchise, without any of the actual humor. \n\nTo be clear, I never laughed at any point during the entire first season. I guess if it was actually super funny I could overlook some of the dumb stuff, but to me it isn't. I stopped watching at some point in Season 1. Haven't seen a single episode of Season 2, so I don't know if it has gotten better or not. I don't care anymore. I never watch this many episodes of anything, just in hopes it might get good at some point. \n\nIn a way Lower Decks is even worse at just throwing references at you than the rest of Kurtzman Trek. I'm always surprised when someone says it's the only new Trek show they actually like. I don't get how this is better than Discovery, a show I stopped watching after Season 2, because it was just too stupid. \n\nIn theory an animated ST show could be awesome, given that you can show absolutely anything with animation, that wouldn't work as live-action. But this isn't it.",

If there is something about them that makes them uninteresting or infuriating to watch then that is a problem with how they were executed in their introduction.",

We go to every convention we can in Europe, and my dad has a huge love for the series, as he, as a brit, also grew up with it.\n\n We have a \"family dinner must be done while watching star trek rule\" (which btw I will pass on since I mananged to find myself the only guy in Spain who also likes Star Trek), and when Lower decks came out we watched that. We all like it, my dad and I get the references the most, he understands its a comedy and its lightweight, but we both really enjoy it, more than the other new ones. \nYeah, its different, but thats part of the fun, its clearly made with lots of care and love, at least thats what we feel, and while it will never be our favourite series, we really enjoy it.",

Or that a racist would be a big fan of Star Trek, considering the content of the show. What you said is silly. \n\nIf their goal was to piss off racists, fine. But there's plenty of collateral damage by putting a polarizing failed political candidate on a show that is supposed to appeal to people who want a brighter future for humanity. You want to piss off racists, and not annoy a good chunk of your fan base? Have Neil Degrasse Tyson as the president of Earth. I bet you he would have been happy to do it. \n\nWhat's next? Is Beto going to lead the revolution of immigration reform on Picard and speak his broke ass West Texas Spanish? \n\nSeriously. For a profession that invented the phrase, \"read the room\", these writers aren't very good at reading the room.",

I've only seen a handful of MAGA losers whining about it. Nobody else seems to care. \n\nPatrick Leahy has a cameo in like half a dozen Batman movies, wanna complain about that next? John McCain was in Wedding Crashers. Biden went on Parks & Rec. The list goes on. A cameo isn't a new concept, even for politicians. Get over it.",
