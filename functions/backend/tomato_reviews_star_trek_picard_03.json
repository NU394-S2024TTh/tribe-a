It's watchable and has some fun and exciting drama. If this was the first season and not the finale, it would be fine, but it's too little WAAAYY too late. \n\nPros: all the main characters from TNG are back and act like the aged version of themselves with new arcs and growth to their characters. Visual production is cinematic and great. The story is good and keeps you invested and guessing at the season long mystery. Some of the new characters are also great with great preformances.\n \nCons: There is still A LOT of filler, especially in the middle episodes 4-6, but every episode moves the plot along. Some of the characters (Ravi) are still written poorly and their performances are awful. The story's conclusion is just the lamest, eye-rolling, forced ending since TNG's 'Conspiracy' (just really dumb and self indulgent sci-fi action, Seven's action scenes probably being the worst thing I've seen in a Star Trek series, but I've also avoided most of new-Trek). There's a lot of coincidence and forced plots to wrap up episodes that weren't going anywhere, way too many for a show this short. \n\nConclusion: If you're a really big fan of TNG it's worth a watch. I couldn't really recommend it to casual fans of Star Trek or sci-fi in general unless they already had a Paramount+ subscription or were just really desperate for something new to watch that was written well enough and exciting throughout. I doubt I'll ever revisit it, and I'll probably forget I ever watched it within the year.",

First, it had one of the most annoying villains I've ever seen on tv or in the movies. Second, for the most part it didn't live up to the way in which the original Next Generation used futuristic, sce-fi settings to probe current issues.\n\nNonetheless, Season 3 was a thoroughly enjoyable romp that occasionally poked fond fun at its original Next Generation characters and characteristics, while remaining true to the spirit of that enterprise. And it showed how good an ensemble cast can be, as the actors seemed to enjoy appearing with and playing off each other one last time.",

And while this might sound like a redeeming feature, it's actually a double-edged sword. On one hand, it finally feels like the show is giving fans what they've desired, but on the other, it underscores a three-year journey of missed opportunities. Even in its best moments, the series lacks the heartfelt, character-driven narratives that have made Star Trek an enduring phenomenon. The glaring mismatch between what \"Picard\" could be and what it is, seems to point directly at Alex Kurtzman. And with shows like \"The Orville\" by Seth MacFarlane capturing more of the Trek spirit, even with its off-kilter humor, one can't help but wonder if a change in leadership wouldn't set \"Picard\" on a better course.",

And even amongst the primary characters some of the additional story came across as forced opportunities to emote for connection to the viewer. I found some of the character's actions and decisions inconsistent such as sacrificing redshirts but going out of the way with extended dialogue and action to save new characters I'm supposed to connect to but have little history to. \n\nSome legacy character development was disappointing  and the resurrection of others reminded me of how heroes and characters in comic books and prior Star Trek series were handled. To me that cheapened my emotional connection to the first closures, stories, and series and distances me from the series and new productions as nothing past is really permanent; just re-boot the old story for your new story and new audience. Which makes me decide, why should I even invest emotionally. To me it comes across as manipulation (emotional) for the sake of continuity and ratings and that there are no consequences. \n\nFor me, the most emotional moment was hearing Majel Barrett's voice. \n\nIf I see the TNG crew in the future, I'll look forward to very brief appearances that drive a new story forward instead of looking back and sitting in nostalgia.",

This season pays such legitimate respect to the characters, their love for each other, the ship, Finally giving the characters real acting challenges. Finally allowing Worf to kick butt. Troi's powers finally did something helpful. The humor was actually funny. Ending with poker. Thank you Terry Matalis. I don't know where you've been, but can you do more of these?",

The characters were wildly different than they were in SNG and their interactions were often entirely unrealistic. Geordi was a complete wimp. Riker was largely a weakling who shockingly and publicly disrespected Picard in early episodes. Riker's relationship with Troi was always annoying, He must have said Emsadi like 20 times. Worf was a caricature. The Data return--again--was unrealistic and Data-Lore duality really forced. I can't maker heads or tails of Dr. Crusher's back story. And I thought the Picard's-son narrative was really forced. I liked the main villain and Seven of Nine though. The fall of Star Fleet ran entirely counter to the 50+ year canon. And the ultimate resolution of the Dominion was far far too easily accomplished. The whole series felt phoned in and seemed as if it was written by the D team.",

I only got into Trek about four or five years ago, but since finishing the original various series and movies, I've been wanting a TNG reunion like this. It's like Paramount gifted Trekkies everything they thought we wanted, and I love that. When a fandom is crying out with similar ideas of what they like and want to see, listen. That's what it seems like Paramount did with this, SNWs, and Lower Decks. So flippin good. It's shocking to me how emotional I got during this season. It's like when everyone gets introduced I start balling. When Data inevitably does his thing and saves the ship, I couldn't stop crying. Data helped me get over a lifelong fear and chronic nightmares of terminator-like things, so seeing him back in action doing what he does best was amazing. I'll admit I haven't finished the season yet, I have about two more episodes I think, but I just couldn't standby without showing my appreciation to the staff and producers that worked so hard to make this show and season as good as it was, especially season three. \n\nThe ship museum and stealing parts from the ship that crashed into San Francisco Bay in Whale Trek put the biggest smile on my face. I'm almost apprehensive to finish the last few episodes because I don't want it to end \ud83d\ude1e \nHopefully Picard was enjoyable for new fans and old fans alike. When I'm a graceful retired old gal I'll watch this show and reminisce about my good old days and relate to this show in even more ways I can now. \n\nLive long and prosper \ud83d\udd96",

If they put as much passion into the next show as they did this sendoff, it will be an incredible show.\n\nGone is the overt political messaging (Star Trek has always been progressive, but it was also hopeful) that sacrificed substance and story, and the heart of this season is a broken family trying to fix their relationship after all these years.

The show would have been better served had they held the course and this should have been a 2-2.5 hour movie special.\nOn a positive note, the production design is top notch and the actors' chemistry and love for each other just leaps off the screen and is the saving grace.",

I thought Laris was a much more interesting character and made more interesting by Orla Brady.  So it's the old buddies once again, they even find a way to resurrect Data and the fact that the android has aged just gets a sneak by.

It never fails to deliver and tends to even surprise. My only complaint is the last stretch of the 10 episode closure to TNG is spent with a wealth of goodbye speeches that seem strangely out of place given the stress of the situations. We know why they did it, and we knew they would leave it open to a new series, but I think they could have tied it up with the same level of thought and grace as the rest of this send off. It doesn't hurt anything, sure, but it goes from being epic, and a masterpiece to just a little sappy right at the point where it shouldn't be. Overall, this is definitely the way to end the TNG run. It serves far better than the previous 2 Picard seasons. Highly recommended. As for the wealth of people complaining that this is nothing new or original, or even going the way of Star Wars - so what? They're not wrong, but so what? TNG ended for all of us a long time ago with Nemesis, and some dismiss that installment. One more adventure, one more recap, and a bit of where are then now. Yes, it is reminiscent, and yes, it feels like every other story people complain about but guess what - the whole history of human kind is exactly that anyhow. We love repeating ourselves. We love pointing fingers and saying this is the same as that, and in doing so, we become the same as everyone and everything else as well. So just watch it like you would an episode of TNG. If you think it smells too much like Star Wars, then just think about how much it also sounds like Batman. When you run out of comparisons, ask yourself if in the moment you liked that you finally got to see Worf get his day. Or that you always knew they would bring Data back from within B4. But did you see it happening this way? Maybe we all can relax on being pissed off for no reason. The only way Picard season 3 could be considered a disservice for me, would be if they made a season 4. I thought \"all good things\" was a good end for TNG.

TNG was a great series, but not without it's flaws. I was sad that a lot of plot points were never revisited or addressed and annoyed that the last episode 'all good things' left so much unfinished and these weren't fixed in later films. I never thought there would be closure until Picard S3. I had watched S1 and it just wasn't star trek. Picard was more Patrick Stewart than the character of Picard and the universe went against Roddenberry's vision. S2 I totally gave a miss after hearing many people talk about it. I knew it was terrible. I wasn't going to give the series another look until I heard the Red Letter Media guys talk about it and I decided to give it a try. So glad I did! It was written by someone different, someone who actually likes Star Trek, and it shows. The universe and characters were true to themselves.\n\nWe finally get a proper end for these characters, to see the female characters actually do something - Gates McFadden actually getting  to do and say stuff of substance! All the characters finishing their arcs in a satisfying way, so much nostalgia and references to the show that made my nerd brain very happy. I'm not so cynical that I cannot enjoy things and enjoy this I did, memberberries and all. This is the first time I have loved a Star Trek show in decades. Been a few ST shows I like or find enjoyable, but not loved. This I will buy to rewatch. To me,  this was not Picard S3, it's TNG: S8. \n\nIt might not have the philosophy that TNG is known for, but it had the action, adventure, and excitement of the films, the nostalgia of the series, with the character depth needed to give it a proper finish.\n\nOnly thing I would have liked is if Picard and Crusher actually officially got together. They sort of left that open, but I'm just gonna head-cannon that they did.\n\nSpoiler: I also like the extra scene at the end and look forward to if they do a short series with just Jack and Q, because that would be fun! Let Picard and the crew rest now.",

When you think about the vastness of space, and how the entire universe is your canvas with science fiction, you have to lament how \"fans\" demand that Terry Matalas makes all future trek and only make what they have already seen. They don't want to be challenged or exposed to anything new, they just want what they have already had, reheated and served on a tinfoil tray.\n\nI can see why Patrick Stewart never wanted this and I commiserate with him.

Because everything else was so cringe from dizzying timelines and alternate realities to the all-encompassing lens flares to killing off episodic mode and getting everything so dark that once iconic sets are now floating projections with no background and least but not last waaay down to using swear words. And with the final two episode of ST P the transition from star trek to Star Wars is complete. If you look at the story's structure it is actually identical with SW episodes 5 and 6 but this time Jack, the son is lured to the dark side and Picard the father is to bring him back with no magic light-sabre duel, but empty words, from a powerless pathetic -once glorious and one of the most celebrated villains in sci-fi film and tv \u2013 The Borg Queen aka Emperor Palpatine in the throne room. Then you have the Death Cube and The Enterprise Falcon flying like a, erm, fly through its inner corridors to reach wait for it!... The Core of the super structure where they must destroy it with blast torpedoes. And right when all seems lost Deanna Organa through her Betazodian Jedi skills knows exactly where Jack Skywalker is. R2Data discovers his guts and jumps the ship to lightspeed. They escape the destruction of the super structure just in time and space before getting caught in the blast. The rest is also painful to watch and sad seeing Picard's botched face and voice and Doctor Crusher's super stretched face and skin. But the saddest and most infuriating part is 7o9. For all 3 seasons she was just there as a hot MILF doing nothing at all. Once saving the entire franchise and literally having us all glued to CRT tv-s then DVDs then streaming and rewatching it a million times Seven is just dull as dull can be. The witty replies the perfect body posture the Borg skills and the famous trademark hairdo and futuristic cat suit all gone. She looks and feels not 24th century but definitely 21st. And then the never-ending vomit inducing nostalgia. I understand that it is impossible to write new charismatic characters that can be portrayed by charismatic actors, but I think that is not even Paramount's plan just to have more of the same endlessly. Forgettable and unimpressive absolutely not rewatchable hope still lingers in me that one day somebody will return with the original way of ST the kind Roddenberry visioned.",

The writers were clearly bored with where the season was going, so they pivoted sharply from one main enemy to another. The big bad was easily defeated, and then the other looming threat was magically dealt with offscreen and referenced in a single dull sentence.

Season 1 also stars Alison Pill, Isa Briones, Harry Treadaway, Michelle Hurd, Santiago Cabrera, and Evan Evagora. Season 2 adds Jeri Ryan, Orla Brady, Wil Wheaton, Whoopi Goldberg, and Brent Spiner. The 3rd season adds the remaining TNG cast members LeVar Burton, Michael Dorn, Jonathan Frakes, Gates McFadden, and Marina Sirtis.\n\nIn a nutshell, each season has its own compelling story. If you are a TNG fan, season 3 is a MUST-WATCH! It is an exemplary sendoff to the TNG storyline. (10/10)\n\nP.S.

The show's themes of redemption, sacrifice, and legacy are all brought to the forefront, culminating in a finale that left me feeling emotional and satisfied.\n\nThe standout performance of Patrick Stewart as Jean-Luc Picard cannot be overstated. He brings a gravitas and nuance to the character that makes him feel both familiar and new. The supporting cast also shines, particularly Isa Briones as Soji and Michelle Hurd as Raffi. The chemistry between the characters is palpable, and their interactions are a joy to watch.\n\nWhile the series as a whole may have had its flaws, the final episodes of \"Picard\" more than made up for them. The show's writers managed to tie up loose ends, while also leaving enough room for future storytelling. The final scenes of the series are particularly touching, and serve as a fitting tribute to one of the most beloved characters in the Star Trek universe.\n\nIn conclusion, while \"Picard\" may not have been perfect, the final episodes of the series more than make up for any shortcomings. The show's themes, performances, and production values all come together to deliver a satisfying conclusion that will leave fans of the franchise feeling fulfilled.",

Mr. Campea and Angry Joe, go take a look at the audience score of The Mandalorian season 3 and compare it to this. Back to Picard. This truly was an epic series and near perfect.

Those who, like me grew up with Picard, Riker, Dr. Crusher, Data, LaForge, Deanna Troi and Mr. Worf will be treated to a real treat.\n\nStar Trek: Picard as a whole was a real treat, and Season 3 was the richest, sweetest icing on the cake. 5/5, *****, 100%, A+++",

Bringing back Q after his character arc clearly ended is the perfect example of the deeply flawed writing. Instead of leaving Q resolved, it undoes the death of Q and regresses to a Farpoint-esq statement of humanity-on-trial... again.\n\nLikewise the golem was setup to become a fusion of Lore and Data, but just so the audience is not made uncomfortable this is delivered through an absurd fakeout where Lore becomes Data then deletes Lore.  By the rules that the episode established, Lore should have changed as a person after absorbing Data's memories, becoming the blended fusion they teased.  The season is full of this type of internal rule-breaking and pandering to the audience as to avoid any unpleasant or ambiguous outcomes, which is insulting to the viewership.\n\nThroughout the season the writers were clearly afraid of making any intentional changes to the legacy characters, but seem perfectly fine accidentally making Riker forget his daughter, making Picard decide to murder a prisoner with zero reckoning later, and making the Borg a boring revenge-obsessed villain instead of the established and much scarier emotionless assimilators.  Season 3 is a mediocre show masquerading as a great one and relies entirely on the name recognition of its cast to survive.",

Wherever they could, they put the Starfleet symbol on it, almost as inflationary exaggerated as the swastika is shown in ridiculous WWII computer games. If nothing was possible visually at a given moment, then a familiar Star Trek sound was played in the background, regardless of whether it was appropriate or not. The same goes for the music. All the motifs that the franchise used in TV and cinema from 1966 to 2001 were shamelessly used. Of course, the music was used inflationarily, whether it suited or seemed completely overdone. \n\nKnowing that the characters are legendary to you, they were just portrayed as generally legendary. Each reintroduced with as much exaggerated and misplaced pathos as possible. Sure, even the president is named Chekov. After all, there are only a zillion inhabitants of the Federation, who cares, the President must have something to do with familiar characters.\n\nThe plot was just nonsense. The characters were barely recognisable, and I don't mean visually. The decision makers of this show just don't know anything about Star Trek and even worse, they clearly don't like it. This show was so inauthentic and alienating, as if an adult wants to play along with children without having any idea what the cool toy of some hip franchise is all about.\n\nImagine if this season with this exact plot had taken place as season 8 of TNG. Exactly in the look of TNG and directly after 1994. The fans would have freaked out what this nonsense is about, where only fragments of the Star Trek universe are recognisable and these are highlighted so strikingly, so that it is not noticeable that otherwise the entire plot is simply no longer oriented towards Star Trek.\n\nMany fans are simply so desperate that they cheer because they simply show them the bridge of the Enterprise D again and the Enterprise is back. But that's exactly what every TNG episode, even the worst of them, has offered. These are just the simplest basics. It seems that is enough to satisfy to lot of people. Enough to turn the last rotten tomato to gold these days.",

Firstly, they recycled a few things (such as beaming onto the space station and beaming onto the cube) and I wasn't too keen on seeing those plots in the same season. Secondly, it felt like they rushed the last few episodes of the season. We had an interesting plot with the changelings and the main initial baddie, but this plot line literally went out in a whimper rather than a bang, and the connection/history they had with the borg was barely explored. Thirdly, the copypasta fleet *again* - why do the fleet comprise of the SAME ships every time these new series? And why so many? Why do starfleet need so many ships? I suppose for continuity with prior season you had to, but come on! Fourthly, this was like watching an episode of Friends at times. I get that it is a Next Gen reunion, but it was at times like eating a tub full of icing sugar. Fifthly, the cameos/mentions of Voyager and Enterprise (maybe DS9 also) was so weak. Yes, cool, we got to see Archer's old ship (a picture would have been a nice touch) and we saw Tuvok. But that it? Given this is revolving around 7 of 9 a bit, where are the Voyager mentions? Paris? Chakotay? hell even Admiral Janeway didn't appear. Must say but as someone who never watched TNG but got hooked on Voyager/Enterprise I'm in a weird place with these new series. It's either garbage (DISC) or extreme throwbacks like Picard. Hopefully they come out with a Voyager-themed one in the future.",

And I think they did a great job at that, while still managing to bring about meaningful character development for all the members of the old crew -- really astonishing job at that.\n\nThis is, obviously, a series and a season for long-time TNG fans. I'm one of them, so it's tricky to judge this show objectively, since it throughout its run, and this season in particular, plays so much with (in a good way) with our feelings torwards the series and the characters. However, I can confidently say that, for long-time fans of Star Trek, this is not gonna be disappointing. Rather, it's clear how much passion went into this season, even how much it means for the entire cast. It's a love letter for TNG, and a much needed and waited for one at that, and I'm glad to have watched it.\n\nIn conclusion: it's a great finale for a (and this is gonna sound controversial) great series. I'm actually one of the rare people who loved Season 1 too (it's true, I really dad), and I feel like Season 3 also did a great job at giving us a peak at the characters we all love's future. It was just marvellous to see the whole crew back together. It's very hard to screw this up, and Paramount managed to do a very enjoyable show around that premise.\n\nAs a last side note, I'm glad they made it obvious that a new series around the crew of the Enterprise-G (and particularly Jack Crusher) is a very real possibility. I think that's a great idea and I can't wait to see it if it actually happens. I think that'd make for a great new Star Trek show premise, probably the best one (far ahead of Discovery, Strange New Worlds and Legacy) we've had so far since Star Trek's most recent revival. So let's keep our fingers crossed and hope that they do that. I'm sure all the fans would absolutely love that!",

This is proof that science fiction, especially Star Trek can still be enthralling and not just capture the imagination, but absolutely lovingly embrace the imagination in a state of joyful wonder.  It also honors the characters that we grew to love and appreciate so much.  I'm going to find it difficult not to vote this as my favorite sustained season of Star Trek ever.

This, in this form, is the Picard we wanted. It feels like Star Trek again. Proof that all it takes to be brilliant is a good story, strong writing and a cast and director that understands what Trek is. My pet peeve with the first two seasons was how weak and ineffectual they made Picard. While the writers still write Picard far too philosophical, wordy and indecisive, it's less so this season. Picard was always strong, in charge and a man of few words. I don't think the writers know that Picard, who now has a tendency to self-doubts and likes to blather on at length about his feelings. The old Picard would have cringed at displays like this. Other than that, the cast is solid and fairly true to their characters. They still feel \"right\". The exception is Worf. The silly pacifist nonsense and jokey stuff doesn't work for me. Amanda Plumber amazes as usual and is easily one of the most effective baddies I've seen on Trek. Great to see her back doing what she does best, being all weird and scary as hell. If there's a weakness here, it's resorting to the Borg as the main villains once again. Yawn. The Changelling connection was inventive though. Captain Liam Shaw is played masterfully by Todd Stashwick. This character along with his ship and crew could easily carry a whole new series on their own. Every single episode of this season has looked and felt like an action-packed movie under the competent and skilled direction of Jonathan Frakes. So much so that Picard season three feels like a whole new show. What a shame this invigorated season is its last. More please!",

They were leading down the memory and purpose of Star Trek a horrible path and were either bad story telling or could be confused for election period in American politics rather than being the vision of Star Trek.\n\nNo more (mostly) with Season 3. Seriously, if you heard all the bad stuff of the first two seasons, don't bother even watching them They will dilute the experience you are getting with the final season. The first two seasons are also not needed story-wise and can be safely discarded.\n\nLet's talk first about the bad stuff in Season 3: They still use a linguistic style here and there that reminds more of the real-world 21st century rather than what they used to in TNG. However, it has been toned down massively in Season 3. Some ship designs are also questionable and seems too experimental to make the backbone of the post-Nemesis Starfleet.\n\nNow to the good stuff, let's continue right with the ship designs here: I love the USS Titan-A, it takes a proven, reliable Starfleet design concept and merges it into the 25th century. While these things are subjective, one will notice that there are WAY more close-up ship shots that can be enjoyed in detail - at last!\n\nSeason 3 manages to re-engage with certain open questions that remained from the original TNG show (not gonna write what so as not to spoil) and it is amazing that these little character storylines are being picked up and integrated into the larger story. The larger story itself is engaging and interesting because you want to know for a great part of the series what is going on and certain revelations will entertain you well! \n\nFan service and nostalgia are an absolute 10/10. I really, really want to express it but in order not to spoiler I will contain myself and just say: I have waited for this since the 90s!! Set course, engage! Cannot wait for the final episode.",

No. Is it all about the nostalgia? No. As old and young actors both work great. It is that the characters are still evolving - even those of Riker and Co. And, oh, Jonathan Frakes! Why do show us your true ability of acting that late in live? \nThere sure are logic plotholes. But they are not as obvious or lorebreaking that they really count (one thing that Deanna did, was not what she normally would do). \nSo what is this show then? \nIt is decently written, emotional through story not through a protagonist crying, it is funny, it is true to the world before, it tries to connect ... well, Generations. \nAnd the enemy was better hidden until now than Sauron (come on! EVERYBODY knew it was him all along!).\nSo here we go: It is Star Trek as it always was. Some good episodes, some not so good. Over all just good fun and tension. \nIt is plain entertainment and escapism. That is much more than most of the shows lately. Writers of the world: Look at Picard 3.",

But......... the charaters in a Star Trek story 1) LIVE in that world and not in a meta-narrative-hero-worshipping hype of their world. 2) are smarter than the problems faced before them (AND TRUST THE AUDIENCE TO ALSO BE SMART). 3) and the only things that undermine their senses of reason and logic are their human vulnerabilities. A person can act like an idiot when they are scared or furious or made complacent. That's fine. That's being human.\nMY PROBLEM with BAD TREK is when people are stupid............... to tell a joke to the audience................for temporary hypnosis reasons........... for \"the rule of cool\" reasons...........or for horny reasons.\n\nSo, as I am sure, Kurtsman is off somewhere writing Star Trek Academy with \" And then the ninjas come in! But then they use a hypo spray with Captain Kirk's blood to free the ninjas from mind control because Spock taught Kirk how to do that and  the DNA sequence maintained a memory of it..........\", I want him to calm down, ignore the accidental paychecks he cashed in from Gene Roddenberry's corpse, and think \"Maybe the audience is smarter than I am. I should show them so respect. Also. If I have 23 producers on a show, then what the fuck are they doing?\".\n\nYeah, Picard Season 3 is good.

The first two seasons of Picard were decent adventures with lovely nostalgic moments, good new characters blended with a few legacy characters, and some very satisfying moments of resolution for a few heavyweight characters, namely Data and Q.\n\nBut season 3 is basically the ultimate TNG reunion tour. It gets the whole core cast of TNG (minus Wil Wheaton so far, though he had his cameo in season 2) back together for one final thrilling adventure. Also returning is the wonderful Jeri Ryan as Seven of Nine and she again develops more depth into her character in almost every scene she gets an opportunity to perform in. Also returning is Michelle Hurd as Raffi, who continues to shine in this season, though with a slightly more back seat role this time to clear room for the legacy characters. \n\nAnd there are some new characters to get to know and explore as well, including Jack Crusher, (excellently played by Ed Speleers) the LaForge daughters, and, perhaps most notably, Captain Liam Shaw, played to near-perfection by Todd Stashwick. Shaw has quickly shifted from an irritating and obstinate obstacle for the heroes to become a fan favorite character worthy of helping his own show, should an opportunity arise. \n\nAnd I would be remiss not to include Amanda Plummer as the villainous Vadic, who very well might be the best Trek villain since the great Ricardo Montalbahn as Khan, himself. (Honorable mention to the Alice Kreig's Borg Queen) She chews up scene after scene with a perfect blend of intelligence, egomania, and chaotic madness that sits right on the edge of \"over-the-top\" without ever going over into campiness. In some moments, she's truly terrifying. Yet Plummer and the writers manage to make her a somewhat sympathetic character with her backstory. She's a truly fantastic and all time great Trek Villain!\n\nAnd of course, the original cast\u2026 they're all back and in top form. Each character gets some worthy screen time and development that adds depth, warmth, and humor to them. It's impossible, as a fan, to overstate the joy of seeing these characters all together again for one more exciting adventure! It would be too long of a review to detail each actor's best moments, but suffice it to say, fans of each will certainly find moments to really love.\n\nThe visuals are also amazing! New ship designs by wonderful artists from both Trek past (Rick Sternbach, Doug Drexler, and Michael Okuda all return to offer input) as well as new (ship designer Bill Kraus, in particular, provides glorious new designs that are inspired by the best of past Trek) offer \"starship porn\" galore that really feel like a blend of classic Trek and new, exciting designs. And the sets are absolutely beautiful. Also amazing are the costumes and updated uniforms. Cosplayers will have a field day with these updated designs, certainly.\n\nThe season is packed with adventure, nostalgia, Easter eggs galore, wonderful writing, excellent visuals, and just great Trek fun. Kudos to showrunner Terry Matalas for some of the best Star Trek ever and I, for one, sincerely hope he is involved in more Trek productions to come. If so, the franchise is in excellent hands. Well done and, if this is to be Picard and TNG's swan song, it is a most worthy ride indeed. LLAP\u2026",

Picard is not deeply affected by the loss of Data. \nDid anybody else watch TNG? Picard tolerated Data, there was numerous episodes where Picard would show his frustrations with him, but he valued him as an important crew member. Once, they thought Data was dead and Picard's reaction was \"We need a replacement officer\". The only person Data was truly close to was Geordie and called him his best friend.... let me use this as a sudden transition to talk about Season 3. \nAfter seeing (somehow getting through) the first 2 Seasons, I honestly can not believe Data acknowledge Geordie before he did Picard (S3 E5). I know this is a oddly specific point, but for me this is Proof the writers have finally done their homework. Also note Picard now speaks like TNG Picard, short abrupt language in conversation, none of the absolute poetic drivel he was spurting out in S1 & S2. The fan service is nonsensical to the max but hey you wont care as long as the \"real\" bands back together, hey we have even got a very good villain who isn't a one dimensional revenge cry baby. What's more is we've got a little bit of all the shows thrown in now, the grittiness of DS9 plot, seemingly a follow up and have the Dominion just evolved or is their more to it.....maybe a team up with Species 8472...oof, sorry that's a deep cut. \nThe only thing I really want is for Janeway to show up and tell Picard he's been a melt and needs to sort it out his issues. A talking down from her would really do that man some good.",

Some how, a good Star Trek show made it past the board room idiots, intersectional DEI commissars and executive producers that want to virtue signal. And allowed good writing, better music and actual Acting to be recorded, properly edited and published. Federation ships that look like Federation ships. Who'd have thunk it? I'm not a fan of the salty language. Star Trek was better than that. You can get more with great writing and better acting than can ever be conveyed with a few curse words. Plus, it limits the audience age. Not smart. Why limit your audience size?\nBut at this point, I'll take it. Warts and all.\nI do recommend, that Paramount looks at who was integrally involved in Discovery and Seasons 1 and 2 of Picard, and not involved in Season 3 of Picard, and keep them as far away from their studio as possible. An example where they could be: an unemployment office.\nThank you to whomever cared enough about this intellectual property to do right by TNG. They are closing open storyline threads from when TNG left the air. And so far appear to be, as best possible,  unmaking the poop sandwich stupidity written into Season 1 and 2.\nThank you!",

      "review": "Let's start with the basics: I am a french trekkie and have watched all the TV shows, except discovery (seriously the klingons.. and the unsympathetic hero). For Enterprise, I love Scott Bakula as an actor and you want to befriend the guy.. but it was difficult to see him as an actual captain. Deep Space Nine is my favorite, then TNG. Voyager was a fun (bug too long) experience and going deeper into the Borg storyline.\n\nOk review: Picard season 1 & 2 are ok but disappointing; obviously the show is named Picard.. so it had to be around him, but the 2 seasons were far too centered on him, his past, his regrets, to a slow drift towards death, to the extent you might just stop caring about his storyline. Yes Picard was great but you don't want him to self-congratule, right ?\n\nBUT season 3 is the season that all true Star Trek fans have been hoping for. And I am not writing that lightly. We have had those movies trying to transform Star Trek in space opera or making it action/adventure style.. That's just not Star Trek. Star Trek is about exploration of worlds and ideas.. And trying to make us think of the society as a whole and how it can evolve. Imagine in the 80s, we were already speaking about : what if AI becomes sentient ? Does it has rights ? Would they really be superior in all ways ? The paradox of Data wanting to be human and his counterpart Lore wanting to rule over lesser evolve humans. The transfer of consciousness in machines, the ethics and problems of cloning. Etc. True Star Trek fans love the shows because they made them think and hope in possible futures.\n\nSo now that you see how I think, here is why I love Picard Season 3 and I think it's the show we have been all waiting for:\n\n(spoiler alert)\nThey finally are reusing old story arcs of characters. The relation between Kimberly and Picard. The family story of Picard, being the last of his long lasting dynasty and his deep regret of not having a son. Worf and his internal human/klingon conflict and how to behave properly, mastering and freeing his inner violence when needed and being... just Worf (imagine Jadzia speaking). Riker and Troy, their family, their lost son, the effects on them and yet their everlasting love being challenged. Ro Laren and the deep intrication of the Bajoran religious (parallel to WWII, the occupation, rebellion, faith, pardon).. and even.. changelings and the dominion wars ! Possibly I have a bias here as DS9 was my favorite of all show, but it's great to see that epic storyline coming back with all that it can bring to the universe. Now, I don't know *yet* they are going with it.. and it could be that they completely fail at the end of the season, especially if they are push to finish early and they won't change opinion on having a season 4. But so far, it's been a pleasure to see that story coming up to life, and all those conflicts/fears resurfacing.\n\nIn addition to all that, they went on simple yet effective designs for the generic and for the music. Nothing too crazy, too flashy, too colorful like in Star Trek Strange New World where you feel like you may be watching a cartoon. Just the right balance to show it's Star Trek and yet more modern.. but not in the wrong way.\n\nSo what I love about that season 3 is that it's a lot more balanced: those are story lines around Picard but this time we come back to Picard and Riker living those stories rather than remembering the \"good old days\". And the integration of all those characters we loved definitely helped to achieve that balance and reaffirm a strong feeling of belonging to the Star Trek family.\n\nSo yes, season 3 is the show that all Star Trek fans have been waiting for, with all the characters they love, reuniting with old characters storylines, gathering them towards new adventures and the goal of saving the federation from another new infiltration of changelings.. with no one you can trust.\n\nMy only fear is this: in season 3, they are giving a lot to Star Trek fans.. and it's great. But will they be able to keep up with the pace they gave ? Will they manage to live up to all the conflicts and expectations they are raising ? I think they might.. and that the first 2 seasons they were fine tuning on how to create a Star Trek TV show in our technological/violent era where if things don't crash and burn in 2s, people are uninterested. It's not perfect, but I think they reached that level where they have a solid story, solid set of characters, solid design.. so let's go where no man has gone before !",

Season 3 is just that good.  \n\nThe dialog is absolutely fantastic and the actors slip right back into their old characters as if they had never left.  Major rehabilitation for Raffi this season, with a great secondary arc.  Some shocking returns really up the stakes and provide a heap of fan service without feeling too forced.  Masterful work striking the balance here.\n\n10/10 so far, excited to see the back half of the season!",

      "review": "Through Ep 5, if you were a fan of TNG and got through S1&2 of this show then you will be surprised at the quality of S3. It has not always been consistent but Ep 5 is great TV. The writing is smart in that Stewart is there and important but not the powerhouse character. Of the original cast, McFadden always seemed a bit unnecessary, and unfortunately that hasn't changed much. Michelle Hurd is a much better female lead and so far this season we have not seen enough of her. If the rumors are true about Michael Dorn, that he cant remember his lines, it makes sense that he's had some significant moments but not a lot of airtime, so far. As for Ed Speelers (Jack Krusher), still not sure what to make of him. He's fine and even though his character's story is a key plot point, it's not clear whether you should root for his success or demise.  This far into the season, that lack of clarity is probably the biggest drawback. Fortunately, the season is only halfway through, so that should be resolved soon.\n\nIn the better days of the now-cancelled Discovery, it seemed like they were going to have a show that was more exciting and that went in this direction. It would be interesting to learn whether they sacrificed that show (which was painful to watch by early/mid-season 3) by using its better stories for this show and perhaps Strange New Worlds.",

It has a solid plot and quality depth of characters.  It has transformed Picard from and slow paced reality TV show of the future into a dark operatic, gritty space western.  I honestly feel like they could have released pairs of these episodes as theatrical movies.  When watching the first two seasons, when the episode was over I thought that it was enjoyable.  Now I am on the edge of my seat dreading the week wait for the next episode to come out.  Every episode, I have checked the time because there was soo much in it that I thought it had to be almost over.  I was pleasantly surprised when I found that there was more to come.  Does the show have some problems? Yes, however they are few in number and severity that they can be overlooked.  If you were like me and had almost given up on Star Trek, I urge you to give this season a try.  You really don't even need to watch the other seasons.  If something is discussed that seems confusing (like Picard being a synthetic lifeform) Just accept that it was something that happened in the first two seasons.",

Never mind that the plot is suspiciously similar to ST2: The Wrath of Khan. \n\nWeak spots. Oh, dear. The cinematography is at times ridiculously choppy. Why do we need to see two characters exchange dialogue from 42 angles? It accentuates the overreacting from some major characters. Michelle Hurd seems to be on a soap opera, she's emoting so hard. Maybe some of this is due to Frakes' direction. But she deserves a pass because the writers put an atrocious piece of exposition into her mouth in the first episode. It was so shameful that I imagine she needed a drink after shooting the scene just to get the taste out. There are several more melodramatic heavy lines that are just way out of character. I'm cautiously optimistic about the plot because in epi 3, they bring in the OG boogeymen from ST: Enterprise: changelings. Hoping this improves with episode 4 and following.",

I would place this above every single star trek production since 2005.\nThere are many moments where this won out for me. Shaw was fantastic and put the idiots in their place. I was so sick of the characters in modern trek acting like undisciplined children and There were numerous points in this season that directly addressed that type of behaviour. The language was also vastly improved. They didn't use as much slang from 3 centuries ago, so it felt more believable. They talked with respect and when tech jargon was used it was vague enough and yet logical enough that it worked, rather than confusing me or making me angry. Okay there were some stinkers like \"subspace frequency\" which was pretty aggravating, but there wasn't much.  The lighting was improved. the ships do need more light, the crew spend a lot of time there, they need to have simulated daylight for their mental health and also to avoid eye strain, at the very least. They aren't short on power, they have a frickin warp engine.  The crew respect each other, they support each other, they don't laugh at their crewmate's misfortune or make disturbing distasteful joke. They have solidarity and professionalism. They have light humour and good natured banter. This is what I want in Star Trek. I hope they take the positive energy from this show and take this forwards. No more discovery. no more picard season 1 and 2. no more of the frat house mentality of strange new worlds. Give us more of this. \nThis is Star Trek.",

I love seeing the old crew again, the writing is so much better, and the absolutely abysmal characters Jurati and Rios are gone - hallelujah.   Those two were so freaking awful, I couldn't stand it.  Picard being a strong man again is amazing; from the first episode of this third season, when he started being himself and not cowering behind others for once, I wanted to applaud.  Loved how he was written and acted in episode 3 especially, when he had his heated discussion with Beverly.  So glad he said what he did.  There are moments that are bizarre, like in episode 3 when Riker has an emotional and, frankly, irrational outburst at the end and orders Picard off the bridge.  Also, it didn't make sense when the actual ship's Captain didn't immediately go to warp once they picked up Picard, Riker and the Crushers near the nebula; he instead wanted to hang out in non-Federation space to feed his curiosity, which was so out of character from what had been established. One other odd thing is why Raffi is treated like some amazing hero; she is (and always has been) overly dramatic and emotional in all of her reactions, although I hand it to her for her tenacity.  I see her as mediocre as a character.  Oh - and one other thing I've noticed: these show writers and visual artists are totally ripping off The Expanse.  The gritty, thumping bars where Raffi goes every episode are like Belter establishments.  I like the look, but it's a total rip off.  I just hope that the season continues the way it started; I am genuinely enjoying this season, whereas I couldn't stand Season 1 and just tolerated Season 2 (except for those powerful scenes between Q and Picard at the end - those scenes made the slog worth it).",

It is always childish, sometimes vindictive, drama -- Riker made a statement to Picard near the end of episode 3 that you would NEVER hear from him, nor anyone else in Starfleet. The statement was wholly dramatic, not constructive, vengeful, and out of character. And would in no way serve to help their situation, and would be trained OUT of Starfleet Officers to think as a reasonable response to a mistake.\n\nThe show is watchable is because it sits next to all of the unfaithful, arrogant, modern trek, and just has to not make a mess of itself to look good.

I mean everyone cried and moaned about JJ Abrams rehashing Star trek's certain Star Trek TOS movie, but seriously? This is damn near plot point by point mimicry. I won't go into details or \"SPOILERS\", which are plainly evident to see anyway by anyone with eyes. And what other fan channels are calling \"easter eggs\" to other ST stories and movies, are in fact not Easter eggs, but plot points actually lifted from....Will no one else at least admit that though it is great eye candy for a Trekkie (such as me) to enjoy ALmost anything Star Trek this is just OLDOLDOLD. We have in every season Data, form of Data or some whatever you want to call it role with Brent Spiner.  And god only knows why. Maybe it is in Spiner's contract agreement? Who knows, but his acting in these past 2 seasons come across flat, drained, and honestly with an air of self-importance not really earned. Self-serving. Picard and Data honestly never had that Kirk/Spock dynamic really going in TNG show. He seemed as close to him as Riker or LaForge.  Their dynamic was better in the TNG movies but if you are gonna pair characters up that had a dynamic on screen for long periods throughout show, then let's do so right now. If you go by TNG show (not movies) only: LaForge/Data, Riker/Troi, Picard/Worf (which makes hella more sense considering what Picard did for him). Or even Picard/Crusher/Crusher. No, I didn't stutter. Any decent Trekkie worth their salt knows what I am inferring. First and second season, but especially first season all but said it outright. Then came Riker's Beard. \n\nNot a decent season of Picard. And that is a shame. None of the new characters introduced throughout these seasons had enough backstory fleshed out for us to bond with and care about. Except the Musketeer that stayed behind last season in Earth's past. I think he is now Harry Mudd's great-great-great-great grandfather. There is a story guys, and please take my idea (but let someone other than your team write it..so call my agent) He carried his scenes, very well. Only for these guys to write him out. Guess nobody should outshine the star. Foolish. At least he had a stallion to ride on into the sunset. He wasn't a red-shirt at the end. The only other one left worth serious interest (and I was surprised to even see her at the beginning) is Orla Brady. She is downright beautiful, and I love her. They offer us a glimpse there might actually be something now between the two. NOW That is a hella way to do a nice sendoff for a legend, by pairing him with a beautiful costar. The hero (whose wife in real life btw is way, way younger than Orla...some of you just cringed-it's true) saves the universe, gets the beautiful woman, and both can ride off together into the sunset. NOPE! They bench her 15 minutes in. Which makes no sense by their own story up to that point \"Trust nobody in Starfleet\" -SHE ISN'T STARFLEET SHE IS TAL SH'AR!! Someone that everyone is LITERALLY SCREAMING they want more of on-screen. Orla also easily carries her scenes (look her up in Doctor Who..choice!!!) and she always shines. Can't outshine the star. Starting to see a trend forming here. Btw I have no issue with age, I applaud him. But his wife needs to leave some of that vigor in him for the show. He needs it to keep up, and it shows. especially in the fireplace scene with Orla.\n\nBut back to my original point and wrap this up (like I sincerely hope this show does) Adding insult to these past 2 lackluster seasons,  they don't even try to give it a proper sendoff in the 3rd Act(season). They weave a 1 hr separate story(which in fact steals from its own past TNG source material) into another story, a weak imitated knock-off copy of a truly wonderful TOS story that was once wonderful to watch. I literally could run these side-by-side to point out how identical, but whatevs. That would be \"SPOILERS\", but saying that about this is like saying don't tell someone that water is wet. Now there could be a final curveball or two, a mild surprise and fake-out, before this ends. But the fact that this season is leaning hard into that material shows weak writing and laziness to begin with.  There is nothing to spoil here. Is there no original story they could have run with at all? Or are they all being given to Discovery and New Worlds (which is so far flawless.. almost, and the night is still young, they have plenty of time to ruin it) This offering is disappointing. And quite frankly not the way to let a Legend in the franchise, one that they have propped back up only to send back out to ride into the sunset.  \nNot on a beautiful white stallion..\n\nBut a donkey.",

Two episodes of Picard: Season Three are enough for me. Lastly, these faults of course are not the actors', who are the shining light of this series (I'm a fan of pretty much all of them, old and new; they do an excellent job, consistently).

The female to male crew casting is still grossly disproportionate, and the majority of the acting (aside from the original next gen cast) is so overly dramatic and poorly executed, it often seems more like a low budget soap opera than Star Trek. \nHOWEVER - despite all of this, season three is what season one SHOULD have been. You have a much higher focus on the show's namesake than in the first two seasons, we are FINALLY reintroduced to some of the beloved characters from first gen.

It's a little better than the last two seasons but they could do better. Not much more information but a little or at least make it look like they try but get cut off.\n\nI bet by the end of season 3, you could cut so much wasted time and make a good, coherent, 2 hour movie. \n\nI'll still watch it though but probably once....

The characters are much more layered and nuanced in their portrayal, and the actors are at the top of their game.  The production design is much more in line with TOS, TNG and DS9. The orchestral score is so great; it's really emotionally moving!! You have to pay attention to the details in each scene, and that's not an issue because this season really does draw you in with its high quality storytelling and unexpected plot. The showrunner is doing a focused political thriller this season, and it has a Tom Clancy vibe to it.  It's really good, and I'd highly recommend it even if you didn't enjoy the first two seasons; it's basically a brand new show now like TNG S8 or STAR TREK XI.",

The introduction of the characters does not seem forced so far, and the tease of future intrigue was well laid out without overpowering the episode's own story. My only concern is it's not clear how they can get Orla Brady/Laris back into the story line and there can never be enough Orla Brady!\n\nNow on Season 3 and they have got it right.
