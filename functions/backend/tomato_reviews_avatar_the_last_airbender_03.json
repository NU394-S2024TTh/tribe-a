No other show I have ever seen does such a fantastic job at using subtle details and backstories to later tie them in and add depth and intensity to the main story. The character of Zuko might well be the most brilliantly conceived and executed cartoon character of all time. He had so much depth and development. His story will have you crying and going from laughing at and hating him to rooting for him as if he was a real person; a close friend. The ending will leave you with a euphoric feeling that soon fades to tragic emptiness,  just craving more. Avatar: The Last Airbender is truly one of the most beautiful stories I have ever seen put to film and without a doubt the best I have seen adapted for television. I don\u2019t use this word lightly but this show is a masterpiece. The only bad thing about this show is that you can only watch it for the first time once.",

      "review": "Wow! What an incredible TV show! This is actually the most successful TV show Nickelodeon has ever created. It has now become my favorite TV show ever! I really appreciate how this TV show focuses on bringing people together rather than resorting to conflict. There are many powerful messages in the show, but the primary one is the importance of the four elements\u2014Water, Earth, Fire, and Air\u2014for our planet's survival. \n\nI was particularly captivated by Jack De Sena's portrayal of Sokka. Sokka, a 15-year-old, is my favorite character. He is remarkably witty, often coming up with brilliant ideas that turn out to be quite humorous. Additionally, he is a skilled warrior and encourages his friends to strive for what is right.\n\nI also found Zach Tyler Eisen's performance as Aang to be highly engaging. Aang, a 12-year-old, is enthusiastic about exploring the world and displays compassion towards his friends during their adventures. He also has a lighthearted side and prefers to unite rather than fight, always prioritizing others over himself.\n\nMae Whitman's portrayal of Katara also intrigued and captivated me. Katara, aged 14, is very caring towards her friends but can be assertive when they don't listen to her. She is nurturing and resolute in the face of danger, standing up against injustice and cruelty.\n\nMichaela Jill Murphy's performance as Toph Beifong was equally intriguing and energetic. Toph, also 12, is sarcastic and direct, occasionally displaying bossiness. However, she is compassionate and resolute when it comes to standing up against injustice.\n\nDante Basco's portrayal of Zuko was also quite intriguing, fascinating, and compassionate. Zuko, aged 16, is intelligent and wise, aiding his friends in resolving conflicts and protecting them.\n\nWhat I particularly admire about this outstanding TV show is its focus on the significance of the four elements in the world. Water symbolizes flow, creativity, and the act of bringing things into existence. Earth represents the maintenance of land, mindset, and space. Fire embodies strength, energy, and decisive action. Air signifies life-force, trust, beliefs, and determination.\n\nAnother aspect I love about this TV show is its portrayal of how a group of exceptional kids can make a difference in the world by believing in themselves. This truly encourages both me and the audience, emphasizing the power of kids to effect positive change by believing in themselves.\n\nI extend my heartfelt gratitude to Michael Dante DiMartino, Bryan Konietzko, and the entire Nickelodeon Studios for creating this remarkable TV show. It is filled with themes of trust, forgiveness, empowerment, fate, destiny, and desire. I sincerely hope that more movies and TV shows with profound societal messages that bring people together and shed light on overlooked stories will continue to be produced.",

The humor is actually pretty good and can provide a nice cushion to the whole evil-tyrant-is-trying-to-take-over-the-world thing. The characters develop in heartfelt, believable, creative ways. The series ends with one of the best wrap-ups of any finale, bringing a logical, emotional and satisfying arc to a close for all major characters. I only passively watched this show on Nick as a kid here and there. Sitting down with it as an adult, I was blown away by the music, themes, colors, characters, worldbuilding, and Avatar's commitment to tell its story and then not stick around for extra cash.",

I love how it takes the highlights of cultures and histories around the world and brings them together in a unified story of understanding.

This season was is epic that it basically has two finales, this was the perfect conclusion to this vast, epic, and addictive show. There is one tiny gripe I have to say about this season and that is that they failed to deliver on the build-up to Zuko's mother, but aside from that, this season is so good that they even were able to make a recap episode creative and entertaining. I remember when this season was released and watching each new episode with my father, then anxiously awaiting next week's episode. I love this show so much that I had to go out and buy the DVD box set when it came out, I really miss the world of Avatar and hope we get to revisit its fascinating world again soon.

That said, this season has by far the best episode selection. Six of my ten favorite episodes are from Book 3. Episodes like Sozin's Comet, The Southern Raiders, Day of Black Sun, Sokka's Master, The Firebending Masters, and The Boiling Rock are flawless pieces of media that I constantly rewatch. This season also has my favorite episode, The Beach. While The Storm and Zuko Alone do resonate with me more and I consider them to be better episodes, The Beach is not only great at humanizing its villains and adding hardcore emotion, but this is the funniest episode. Azula made me laugh out loud at least 5 times and every other character, even the most minor ones, made me burst out laughing. Other good aspects are at their best in this season. The animation is fantastic and truly stunning at times. The action is at its best with the battles in Sozin's Comet and Katara vs Hama are fantastic, creative, and emotional. I also find this to be the funniest season. The Beach and The Ember Island Players are the funniest episodes in the show and moments like \"Hello, Zuko here.\" are literally comedy gold. There are also plenty of tears to be shed. Azula's end, Katara's bloodbending, the campfire scene in The Beach, Sokka and Toph accepting death, and Zuko and Iroh's reunion make me cry every time. The characters are also great. Aang, Katara, Sokka, and Toph are definitely at their best from a humor and character stand point. Aang's fear and dilemna with killing Ozai, Katara's dark vengeance and reluctant trust, and Sokka's rise to leadership are truly compelling character motivations. However, this season does have two issues. The first is minor, and that is one episode. Nightmares and Daydreams is my least favorite episode of any Avatar show. It's humor is awful and so many lines made me facepalm. The tone is inconsistent, going from juvenile and obnoxious to dark and terrifying. The only good things were one or two jokes being so crazy I laughed. What can I say, shock humor just isn't good anymore. However, the real issue is the lack of Iroh. Iroh is hardly in the season, only playing a major role in the finale and maybe one other episode. As he is my favorite character, this initially bothered me. However, I now realize that this does hurt the season. The highlight of the other two seasons was Zuko and Iroh's dynamic. They worked off each other so well and are truly the duo that learns the most in the show. Zuko instead learns a lot on his own in this season. That's all well and good, but I prefer when the two work together. However, the scene where they reunite only works so well because we missed Iroh so much. I can't complain too much, but Iroh is the best character and if he was in the show more, I would have smiled a bit more throughout. Granted, this is nearly perfect and truly media at its absolute best. Too bad Korra never lived up to it.",

This season can only be described as epic with a great finale that ties up every loose end except Zuko's mothers whereabouts but that information can be found in extended lore for those who are interested. The only gripe I could possibly have is that the fire lord while a clear evil threat and presence has next to no motivations other than mustache twirly world domination. Azula is a much more compelling villain will her lack of motherly love due to her sociopath tendencies, manipulation and cruelty which could have led her to feel she needed to prove herself by ruling the world but that is not to take away from what this series was able to do in its story telling and journey in this incredible world. I am not an anime fan at all but there are two anime shows I have ever been a fan of and that Avatar the Last Air bender and The Boondocks. There is certainly a reason for that.",

It hasn't changed the way I see the world, but it certainly makes it very hard to fall asleep at night without thinking of scenes that had such nuanced meaning. The last 4 episodes (aka the finale) were the best ending to a show I think I've ever seen. The only things that come close are book series from my childhood. I am now jaded with other tv shows.

However, as the season 2 begins, the story simply gets more and more interesting. Each episodes draw me in more and more, and push the story to a higher and higher ground. The end of season 2 was absolutely sad, and as season 3 begins, the uprising energy and storyline just keeps going. \nIncredibly inspirational story and full of thoughtful eastern philosophies. 100% would recommend.\n\nEdit after a few days. I have learnt so much from watching this show. The PSD after watching this show is stronger than pretty much all the shows I have watched in the past. The character building is so effective that I felt like I lost a really good friend after the show ends. The utilization of the theme music is near perfection. The emotion I feel every time the Avatar's love starts is indescribable. The creator successfully linked the music a unique emotion with the song, great job guys!",

It is an amazing and epic end for a one of the bests tv shows ever that is why I will give Avatar the last airbender season 3 a 10 out of 10",

It still had great characters and stuff but after the defeat of the heroes in the last season almost every character is different except for Toph.  The season opened strong but then led into the worst episodes of the series (except for the great divide.).  There was this lame assassin that was hired to kill the avatar and he was just merely an obstacle with no character at all.  Once they invaded the Fire Nation in The day of Black sun the show got great again and the characters seemed more similar to their appearances in the first two seasons (Except for Zuko).

      "review": "When I was in middle school, Nickelodeon used to play reruns of Avatar: The Last Airbender all the time. Back then it was still a relatively new show, but I never remembered it airing or ending. However, it was one of the only shows that my sister and I could agree on watching, so I remember the reruns well. I never watched the full show in order. I never saw all the episodes. Only bits and pieces of different episodes stuck with me over time. I always thought it was a good show, but it was never anything more than that. Just some good entertainment. As I\u0092ve grown up (some would say I haven\u0092t), I\u0092ve gotten into conversations about it here and there. Either people remember it like I do, as a pretty good, fun show, or they love it to death, acting like it\u0092s the greatest television show to ever stream across the planet. Hearing people\u0092s adoration for Avatar over the years, I\u0092ve gotten curious. Had I missed something? Was it better than I remembered? So I decided to re-watch it these past couple months. Long story short: Avatar: The Last Airbender IS the greatest television show of all time. \n\nAs I made my way through The Last Airbender, I was continually shocked by how good the show was. Every few episodes or so I was blown away that a cartoon could be so good. I now realize the fault in my thinking. I underestimated the show because it\u0092s a cartoon. I guess it worked in the show\u0092s favor, because I ended up appreciating it even more, but it\u0092s unfair towards the creators. People tend to think that cartoons are just for kids, simply because they\u0092re animated. Recently, with the success of shows like Bojack Horsemen and Rick and Morty, people have understood that cartoons can be incredibly, sometimes shockingly, deep and adult. But because Avatar is a Nickelodeon cartoon, people still characterize it as a kid\u0092s show. The truth is that Avatar is technically a kid\u0092s show, but more so than any other kid\u0092s show ever, it can be enjoyed by anyone. An eight year-old and a 98 year-old can sit down together and receive the same level of enjoyment from it. Because of this, I would call Avatar family-friendly. It\u0092s not a kid\u0092s show. It\u0092s an everyone show, and that might be one of its greatest strengths. Because of Avatar\u0092s incredibly wide audience, it can touch on serious, profound, and emotional issues without being too heavy-handed or serious. So it\u0092s serious without being serious, if that makes any sense. Regardless of everything I just said, I was still a bit embarrassed when I first started watching. During an early episode, before I realized how amazing the show actually is, my roommate and his girlfriend walked into our apartment. I immediately smiled and said, \u0093I know. I\u0092m watching a kid\u0092s show on a Friday night. Don\u0092t judge me.\u0094 Later my roommate told me that his girlfriend had said, \u0093I don\u0092t know why he apologized. That show is fantastic.\u0094 Turns out I wasn\u0092t being lame for watching Avatar; I was being lame for watching Avatar on a Friday night.  \n\nNow it\u0092s time for me to explain why I think Avatar is so good. To be honest, the answer is everything, but I\u0092ll try and be a bit more specific. First of all, the characters are fantastic. They\u0092re richly drawn, and they feel like real people in a real universe. The show starts off slowly with small, serialized adventures. The story becomes more defined eventually, and thankfully a lot of what gets introduced early on is brought back in satisfying ways. The best part about the early episodes is that they slowly and slyly add mounds of characterization to each character, gradually building your affection for them overtime. By the end of the first season, you\u0092ve been introduced to an incredible world, and you\u0092ve fallen in love with the characters that inhabit it. The second season introduces new characters, and the third brings them together for an amazing finale. The way the show adds texture to its main and secondary characters is genuinely something to be admired. Nobody is one-note. Nobody is simple. They really do feel real. \n\nFrom a story standpoint, Avatar is also fantastic. The show runs 61 episodes overall, and I would say all except maybe ten work towards the larger narrative. These ten or so episodes are the most episodic of the bunch, but even at their worst, they still manage to add characterization and simple fun to the series. (One of) The thing(s) that makes Avatar so special is how it\u0092s never black and white. There is good and evil everywhere, in the heroes and the villains. This only adds to the universe as a whole, making it feel lived-in and believable. From an action standpoint, the show is simply stunning. The action scenes are based on real-life martial arts, and the animation brings them to life fully and awesomely. The animation itself is beautiful, and it only gets better as the series goes on. The cinematography is fantastic; the way scenes are framed adds depth to them that would be lost in a lessor effort. The music is amazing. The humor is on point. The emotion is real. The themes are deep. It does not get better than this. \n\nThe Last Airbender ends in a four-part finale that\u0092s essentially a 90 minute movie. Like Avengers: Infinity War, it only works with the foundation that comes before it. But with that foundation, Avatar\u0092s finale proves itself to be one of the greatest conclusions to anything ever. After watching the entire show, it will make you cheer and laugh and cry. I\u0092m not the kind of person who yells things out while watching a movie. The only time I ever remember doing this was during the end of Infinity War for that matter, and I think that was completely called for. But multiple times during Avatar\u0092s finale, I howled at the screen; it was that good. Part of the reason the finale is so satisfying is because the show isn\u0092t dragged out forever. Most TV shows are aired until they\u0092re no longer popular, which leaves them with lackluster and narratively dry endings. Think of The Office for example. Avatar has three planned-out seasons. It wasn\u0092t cancelled; it was designed to be three seasons long. Because of this planning, every character is given exactly the amount of time they need to develop, and everything comes together perfectly in the end. \n\nTrust me, I\u0092m not crazy. If you don\u0092t believe me, google Avatar right now. You\u0092ll see that I am far from the only one who thinks this way. Years of bad publicity from Nickelodeon, a terrible movie adaptation, and a James Cameron movie of the same name have taken the spotlight away from Avatar. But nothing deserves it more than this show. I highly recommend it. Please, if you\u0092ve managed to get to the end of this review, give Avatar a chance. You won\u0092t realize how amazing it is until it\u0092s over, but by then you\u0092ll want to watch it again anyways. That\u0092s because Avatar: The Last Airbender is a modern masterpiece.",
