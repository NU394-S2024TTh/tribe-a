Maybe no dialogue to quote, but also none to fault. It also manages the feat of not being simplistic, unlike most of the action fare out there.

I like that it's a female cast of hot buff women who are out there kickin' ass. And the male actors are nice looking too ;) \nI hope it gets renewed and that the [male] haters don't take away a show that's kinda believable but not so believable it's overwhelming or traumatizing (like SVU or Criminal Minds).

It had a lot of heart, and didn't feel like an accessory for Saldana's character to wear.

I actually fast forwarded through most of that to just watch the operational parts. It's truly sad because this show could have been so much better and really launched a new series.  But with how this one played out I wouldn't bother watching another.",

I appreciated the overall mixture of Special Ops tactics with telling the human stories of Joe's family life and Cruz falling in love with her mark but the last episode was full of plot holes. It was like they ran out of budget and just had to end production really quickly. So Aaliyah's father, one of the most protected terrorist funders in the world, just happens to be on the women's side in his underwear getting a snack when an undercover Marine is there getting some water? So Aaliyah's skeptical fiancee runs a basic Google Image search and discovers there's an assassin in the house and he doesn't immediately arm himself and round up one of the 100 armed bodyguards to hunt her? And wouldn't they have run that same search in the very beginning on a complete stranger that's getting close to the family of the most proceed terrorist funder in the world? And why wouldn't that elite security detail fly a drone over the yacht that just seems parked a little too close to where, say it with me, the most protected terrorist funder is staying?\n\nGreat start to the series. I loved Cruz's backstory. Stefanie Nur and Zoe Salda\u00f1a were fantastic but, I'm sorry, Nicole Kidman was wooden and unbelievable in every single scene. I didn't buy it for a second.\n\nThis series was good but not great...and it had the potential to be great.",

It was a different take on the typical military plot but it could have taken so many other twists and turns whether in relation to the levels of political oversight, or simply within the military hierarchy. For example: Was it truly necessary for an entire episode to be dedicated to the lionesses superior kidnapping and repeatedly assaulting her? There were some things I absolutely found refreshing.

I'm not a big fan of the US government as a whole but they have big decisions to make on a worldwide scale when it comes to terrorism. A lot of people are complaining about the oil situation in the show but we have to remember a lot of Middle Eastern wars i.e. Iraq, Afghanistan where about controlling oil supplies even though the world Gov's say its about protecting us from terrorists. It's not a coincidence that these terrorists are funded by big oil in the middle East, its there main export and without it society would fall apart. The show isn't just about action, its about the consequences of that action and we're learning that ourselves with the Russian war on Ukraine. The world economy is struggling due to increased oil prices which trickles down to every aspect of modern life. Hopefully if/when theres a season 2 it will go into more detail on how the actions in the finale affect the rest of the world. Thanks Taylor for shedding light on this side of the war on terror.",

The acting is extraordinary especially lead, Zoe Saldana, aided by the writing of Taylor Sheridan. We unfortunately live in a time when self expression must take a political side and many critics never give the series a chance and worse completely misunderstand what they are watching. One critic opined that the tough love Jo gives her daughter after the accident was hard to watch. Neither of the bedside scenes were tough love they were multi-layered, loving and contrite. The genre simply put some critics in the position of looking for something to dislike and miss what was really being expressed. This is one of Sheridan's best and it will keep me and a lot of the audience thinking. Thinking is not a bad thing and neither is an open mind to expression.",

It starts off with a bang, full on action and excitement, promising more to come, but quickly gets bogged down into a slow dull spy thriller that seems like a second rate 'Tehran'. There is no suspense, and almost no action. In fact there is so little action that the writers started to include completely gratuitous action scenes with no relevance to the main plot. A drug rape rescue scene. A terrorist take down. Some random home invaders. Anything to try and have the action guys do some action stuff instead of just sitting around looking as bored as the audience. But with no kind of suspense or tension, even that doesn't help. Maybe this gets better in later episodes, but I won't get to see them because I can't wade through the dross that the show has turned into. And James Jordan as a special forces operator? Seriously? He's a great actor and obviously a friend of Sheridan's because he turns up in all the shows, but he is seriously miscast here. Needed the work I guess, and his buddy said 'ok'. \nI think I'll go watch Wind River again, or Sicario, or The Mayor of Kingstown, or early seasons of Yellowstone, just to remind myself how great Taylor Sheridan really is. He's like the little girl with the curl right in the middle of her forehead. When he is good, he is very good indeed, but when he is bad he is horrid.",

Sheridan has a history of writing strong and interesting female characters (Beth on Yellowstone and all the women on 1923) Yes, Kelly Reilly's Beth on Yellowstone is a bitch, but the difference between her and Saldana is that she ENJOYS every minute of it. In other words, she plays to win and, she's multi-dimensional. On top being a ball buster, she's also genuinely funny and loving towards her family and ENJOYS life -- unlike Saldana whose two modes are annoyed harpie or put-upon mom. The look on Saldana's face in every scene is like she's smelling  a nasty fart - and that's BORING. I can see the logic of Sheridan casting her in this role. She's big name and brings eyeballs to the screen but her limited smarts and acting ability seriously undermine and sell short the terrific role Sheridan has written for her.",

      "review": "Something sad happens when you 'meet your heroes' so to speak. You learn their pacing, their language. And Taylor Sheridan has a certain way of going about things in all his television. After seeing so much of his movies and television, I now know his style, type, and setup. Lioness is all of his tricks done poorly. This show is clearly not his best by any stretch, only a jot better than Tulsa King, and not able to hold a candle to Yellowstone. \n\nEasy examples would be Zoe Saldana's balance of worklife and homelife to the Barracks / Bunkhouse / Security Guard quarters banter that he injects into his movies and television writing get hackneyed and old. It is hard not to compare his characters to one another; from Wind River to Yellowstone to Mayor Of Kingstown, there are convenient placements of back and forth that you can hear certain dialogue over and over. \n\nPerhaps that's not fair to Lioness, whose one job is to keep us enthralled and compelled to continue watching but I can't see past the cut and paste writing gears any longer. Not to mention that his Production Company uses the same actors repeatedly as background, makes me wish I was a pal of Sheridan as I know I'd have Acting jobs for life.\n\nBut the essential disquality of the show itself is storyline. What is it about Old Man that was so compelling to make me watch a near elderly Jeff Bridges' sex scenes while Laysla De Oliveira just makes me want to watch something else? While she is acting her heart out it is not transferring to my 'must watch' button. And as for the rest of the cast, they are forgettable. I found myself skipping through certain scenes simply because I want action and tension. I know that if Zoe is with her husband I will be bored to tears, it can be literally cut out and I can move to the next scene and nothing will be harmed in my viewing experience. It is fluff. Same with Nicole Kidman, her CIA handler. If I eye roll at the trite Langley old guard stuff haphazardly discussed over a luncheon at an open restaurant and not in a hardened soundproof skiff, I know the writing staff missed their mark by a country mile and placed the same conversation in a setting that was less stiff, even if unbelievable. Kidman is a complete waste in this show. It is not fair of me (let alone lookist territory) to state but...she's hard to look at. I can't get a read on her emotional state with all that cat lady 'work' she's done and her character has little to add or say of importance. Perhaps in upcoming episodes but I doubt it.  \n\nI had the same experience watching Citadel. While Citadel has a bigger budget (I think) and the shooting style is frenetic, in that show you bounce from flashbacks to love scenes to torture scenes back and forth in pretty much the same way Sheridan does. Citadel has a believable problem as well but theirs is hokey, while Lioness is just plain bad writing. \n\nIf you want to go down the this or that road, tou can easily compare Lincoln Lawyer to Tulsa King or even Jack Ryan. By comparison for something good have a look at Netflix' The Recruit or The Diplomat. Both are solid, fun, easy to watch, and entertaining. And perhaps most importantly, believable. I suffered through Tulsa King, didn't believe a moment of it, and Jack Ryan is good to go to sleep to if you're into having your tv on at 12am. I could barely get through season one on that horrible mishmash of boring.\n\nUltimately, Lioness has to have some lighter moments and more importantly something compelling about the characters. I get how bad ass they are. I get how their lives are filled with turmoil, regret, and post trauma woe. But in order for me to love a character the way I loved Renner in Wind River, Pine in Hell Or High Water, or Del Toro and Blunt in Sicario, I need to love someone in Lioness. And so far, I pretty much detest both sides equally with shades of disdain and boredom. That's saying a lot for characters when you can't 'feel' for anyone in a show. Not one person is realized in Lioness. Not enough to keep me watching after two episodes.\n\nD Sondor Granar.",

Acting is good, and the female lead opposite of Saldana is someone you don't wanna mess with! Great watch. I think this is a step up for Sheridan from Tulsa king",
