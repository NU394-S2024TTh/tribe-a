title,review
Still a lot of questions,"I was looking for a new show to binge and since Yellowjackets has gotten nothing but great reviews from both critics and audience alike I chose this. I'm glad I did because it is something both original and entertaining. I know a lot of people are comparing this to Lord of the Flies and I can definitely see that comparison, it has that kind of feel to the show but also something original. It's an intense mystery thriller that will keep you guessing and wanting more throughout the series. You end up becoming so invested in it that you can't wait to see what happens next and you'll want to binge it as quickly as possible. The entire cast is great here but Melanie Lynskey and Christina Ricci are the real standouts here. Both were just nominated for an Emmy, as was the show itself for best drama. It also currently has a 97% on Rotten Tomatoes. That's how good this is, it's being nominated for every major award their is. I was really looking forward to Season 2 because there are still a lot of unanswered questions that need to be answered but for every answer they provide, there are more questions. Season 2 just ended and there's still way too many unanswered questions."
Glad I gave this a chance,"I finally gave in and gave Yellowjackets a try after hearing so many great things about it. I actually liked it much more than I thought I would, to the point where I'm actually mad at myself for putting it off as long as I did. All the twists and turns will keep on the edge of your seat every episode to the point it becomes addicting. It has everything you want in a good show...drama, mystery, comedy, action, etc. There's not a bad episode in the series, there's so slow episodes but not bad episodes. The acting is what really carries the show though. Melanie Lynskey deserves every bit of praise that she's been getting for her role. She's so good that it's the type of performance that's going to lead to even bigger things for her."
"It is NOT ""Lord of the Flies""","Ñor is it ""Alive!,"" although that's what the people who watch one trailer and the first episode want you to think.But one could forgive them for thinking as much, because Showtime deliberately provokes thoughts of both in the trailer and set up. The airplane for a team of young female soccer players crashes into the wilderness, leaving them stranded and hungry. They will eventually run out of food options, and they know it. The specter of starvation haunts them the minute they run out of fresh meat (and we know what the similarly stranded Uruguayan soccer team did to survive in their real life crash in ""Alive!"").Similarly, every American high school English student knows what happened to the British boys who set upon each other in William Golding's ""Lord of the Flies."" This series deliberately stirs our memory of Piggy by putting the baby-faced Christina Ricci in oversized glasses and a poodle wig.In most series, the pay off for the series would be seeing the girls devolve into gladiatorial self governance that results in cannibalism. Each scene would be a lead up to the inevitable grisly cannibalism after the girls turn on each other. However, this isn't that series, not by a long shot. It doesn't build up to a horrific death scene. It tells you that is where it's going in the first episode, and then, slowly and surely, reminds you that there is going to be life for some of the girls after the others are gone.The series is anchored by the stories of four surviving women and splits the action between what happened 25 years ago around the crash and what is happening now. Different actresses play the characters and women and girls, and they are joined in both timelines by other characters who support the story line.Does it sound confusing? It isn't, primarily because the two show runners cut their teeth doing ""Narcos"" and understand how to tell a complex story. They are helped in their storytelling by the uncanny ability of the younger actresses to match style and idiosyncrasies with the adult actresses, Juliette Lewis, Christina Ricci, Melanie Lynsky and Tawny Cypress.The series defies genre. It's horror, mystery, coming of age, romance, and adventure. The acting is fantastic (Christina Ricci is terrifying), and the script as novel as the first season of ""Lost.""The show is being released on a weekly basis. As of this writing, it is Christmas 2021 and on Episode 6, but the IMDB movie reviews are full of November reviews claiming to know what is going to happen and criticizing the plot. These have to be troll reviews by people who want attention on IMDB, because they could not have possibly seen the show.Give the series the same chance the critics (who loved it) did. The first 6 episodes will be worth your while, and we will see what happens after that."
Trauma,"This is not exactly an easy show to review which might be part of the problem. Trying to compare it to other shows would be a mistake. It is alot like ""Lord of The Flies"" and ""Alive"" but with teenage girls. However that is just a simple explanation. Basically a successful girls soccer team crash lands in the remote wilderness and are forced to learn how to survive. 25 years later the trauma the survivors face is still haunting them. Part survival epic, part psychological horror and part coming-of-age drama. Its about not dealing with your past and what happens years later when it comes back to haunt you."
Old tropes but unique blend,"Yellowjackets is a very trope-y show: the teen drama,the survival/""Robinsonade"", the cabin in the woods, the Blair Witch, the creepy child... Everything very familiar, sometimes even to the point where you wonder if they seriously went there in the most cliché way possible or if they're being slightly ironic about it.The tone is also very varied: from dark comedy to very heavy drama and everything in between, with ample genre mixing (horror, supernatural, realism, coming-of-age, psychological drama).AND YET, somehow everything falls into place in a unique blend of characteristics, none of which feels out of place. What it does most successfully (possibly better than any other similar show), is the deep study of complex decades-long trauma. I love how the intense trauma experienced by the teenage characters is so finely woven into the present day (25 years later) psyche of their adult versions.There's some superb acting by both generations of actors and the technical and artistic aspects are all to a high standard.My only wish, as I'm writing this at the beginning of Season 2 is that it doesn't go the way of LOST, with mysteries piling up without answers and a sense of making it up as they go along. I do however trust that the creators submitted a 5-season arc before production begun, which they'll hopefully stick to (and surely they must have studied LOST as a case study of ""how NOT to develop a multi-season horror/mystery/supernatural/survival show""). So here's hoping."
it's good.,"This is a good show. Is it the height of television? No. Is it compelling? Yes. It's had me hooked since episode one. A mostly teenage cast that delivers convincing performances. I haven't once felt any lack from this show. A lot of bad reviews, i think mostly because people are getting tired of teen ensemble dramas. But this is dark and shocking and much more than those reviews led me to believe. It's not riverdale at all (at all). Not lost either really, although definitely reminiscent. I've watched both of those shows in full, one with regret lol. Give it a try. Heck, it's got juliette lewis. Cape fear anyone?"
The difficult second album,"I really liked the first season and I wish there was a way to rate seasons separately on IMDB.Here's what I wrote in my review of the first season:Hadn't heard a peep about this show, I watched it just by chance. It's good!The acting is pretty good throughout (with some exceptions) and the story is quite intriguing. The flashbacks are more interesting than the modern day story line. The score, and in particular the vocal or choral parts, is outstanding.However, the dialogue leaves much to be desired. One example is shortly after one character discovers a desiccated corpse and says ""Something bad happened here"". What gave it away?? This actually made me laugh since it was almost exactly like when Forrest Whitaker discovered a bloody, gruesome murder scene in Species (1995) and has the same obvious moronic observation.Unfortunately the show falls into the mystery trap when present day characters talk to each other and say something along the lines ""because of what we did out there"" which happens numerous times. I understand why the writer chose to phrase it this way since they want it to be a mystery (and possibly because the showrunners still don't exactly know yet). The problem is that it makes no sense for the characters to talk this way when they're only speaking with each other, it's only for the audience.I have a sneaking suspicion that this show would have benefited from being a single season show with a proper ending, because it's already starting to drag a little. But I'm happy if they prove me wrong with season 2. Let's just hope this doesn't turn into another Wayward Pines.Rating: 8Review of the second season:Well, it turns out my suspicion was bang on target. The tempo slows down even more. Oh how I hate the ridiculous ""slow burn"" fad, which is on par with the shaky-cam fad in the early 00's. Just because something moves along at a glacial pace does not necessarily make it more profound.More mysteries are introduced and none are solved. Also new characters, even ones supposedly in the plane crash although they weren't in season 1. Echoes of Lost abound.The show has in part devolved into farce. The side plot with the police investigation is a dud, especially due to the performance of the new cop.The acting overall is even more broad, sometimes bordering on camp, in particular Juliette Lewis and Christina Ricci. The one part I found the most interesting were the scenes between Shauna and dead Jackie.Such a shame. I can't say I particularly look forward to season 3. AT any rate, let's hope it ends there.Rating: 5."
Lynskey & Lewis & Ricci!,"This little thing was recommended to me by my son. I am not the biggest of horror fans or teenage stuff. But this is not that.This is a VERY well told story and has superior acting first by Lynskey and Lewis and Ricci, and the rest are doing great. Beautifully filmed as well.Go beyond the pilot and get ready for some quality storytelling!"
"Season 1 -8*, season 2- 4*","What happened between season 1 and season 2? Is this another wiess-benioff attempt, where they had nothing to adapt after first book?Season 1 was excellent, mix of Alive, the craft, the edge etc. Plane crash in the mountains, girls soccer team has to learn to survive, but there's something murky in the woods. Is it the girls hunger mentally manifesting, or is it something more sinister Blair witchy like? Modern story also, but not as, interesting, survivors trying to get on with their lives while living with the consequences of what went on in the mountains.Season 2 - WTF?! Game of thrones season 8 in disguise, Ruined all the build up of the big bad in season 1, killed off any interesting plot threads started in season 1, killed off most interesting lead character, made the most interesting character in previous season as tedious and hateful as possible, not enough elijah wood who along with Christina ricci and Juliette Lewis are the only reasons to stick with modern story line as it's bloody awful. Characters jumping to conclusions somehow figuring stuff out, poor writing in general.Get rid of yellowjackets version of benioff and weiss and go back to what made season 1 so enjoyable.But more Walter and misty."
I'm digging this so far.,"First 2 episodes. Great Great cast, performances, storyline...
I assume this is looking for an under 35 demographic . Perhaps not. I'm a young 64 yo. I'm jaded when it comes to entertainment almost to the point that I lose interest. I'm still watching TWD even though I cannot stand anything about it lately.Keeping Showtime till season finale.Loved tonight's episode more than the first and they would have to work hard at screwing this up given how engaging the intro is.Fun."
Duped,"I was totally on board with the first season. Besides Dexter and Homeland, I don't think there has been a show where I've looked so forward to a new season. However, there is a trend in television now that I abhor. Can you say ""dangling the carrot?"" I get it. Writers/Directors/Producers all want to keep their jobs. But at what cost? I'm truly tired of this trend. I just finished Season 2 and I don't know much more than I did at the end of Season 1. Yellowstone and all its baggage: HUGE offender is this way. But back to Yellowjackets. There are some great actors playing the teen version of the characters; some quite compelling. Case in point, the actress playing the teen version of Natalie. Anyway, I really can't say if I will watch Season 3. And with the writers' strike, who knows when that will be? At that point, I may forget everything I've watched. Might not be a bad thing."
Season 1: 7/10. Season 2: 2/10. New overall series rating: 4/10,"I was so intrigued and became very interested in this show throughout season 1, as it was a great premise and told well enough between two timelines in every episode - which is hard to do, but they pulled it off. So I was 10 episodes invested in this show, and waited all this time with great anticipation for season 2, which as I just finished the season finale, ended up being the biggest joke of any series I have ever seen. The entire 9 episodes (I guess they couldn't find enough rubber bands to stretch this season's writing to a nice even 10 episodes, so what does that alone tell you) were maybe a total of a 90-100 min movie narrative with something of substance, albeit a terrible movie at that. So now imagine adding in enough useless filler riddled with plot holes and convoluted writing to stretch it to a max 9 episodes. It became painful. ""It"" became too painful to watch and listen to all the nonsense. A fifth grade drama class could've come up with a better season 2. I'm done with this show and Showtime, for wasting my time."
Good slow burn cross genre,"I'm writing this review 6 episodes into the first season and so far I'm pretty happy with the show overall. Reading though some of the reviews I'm seeing a lot of repeat criticisms - while they're certainly valid, I find a lot of the lower scores are either too harsh or simply exaggerated. If you're considering giving this a watch and you like a cross genre type of show with a bit of sci-fi, horror and mystery, this is definitely worth checking out.There are a lot of complaints that it's slow moving and as the title states, this is definitely a slow burn (sometimes maybe a little too slow) but my main problem here is the way they're bouncing back and forth between the two storylines. The show simultaneously tells two stories involving the same characters both in present day and in the 90's when they were a high school soccer team. The constant and sometimes poorly timed jumps back and forth definitely get on my nerves more than I'd like. It also creates a little bit of confusion at times so with these two elements combined it represents the shows biggest and only significant drawback, for myself at least.With that said, there's a little something here for everyone and that's what I'm currently enjoying most about the show. There's a strong mystery element, some elements of suspense, horror, gore and even a little bit of suggestion of the supernatural. While that's all great, there's also some teenage drama which certainly won't be for everybody but I will say that it's done in a very minimal and palatable way that still is effective in playing out the story. So don't let that deter you!The acting is very very good and while I found that Melanie Lynskey may have been miscast at first, she's really settled into the role and I'm thoroughly happy with the performances of all the cast. Now with this being the 2020's of course identity politics play a role in the writing and casting. As you might assume, the cast is perfectly diverse and comes complete with a black lesbian woman who is strong and in a traditionally male role running for office in the current day. Despite all this, this doesn't fall into the category of Woke Culture Slog like so many other shows have recently. Nothing much feels forced or unfitting so far in the script as far as I can see.So while there are a couple minor flaws and we don't have the next Lost, x-files, or Fringe we do have a great cross genre show that does a good job of combining drama, mystery, sci-fi and horror that's well worth checking out for a pretty broad audience with a little something for everyone. 8/10 would absolutely recommend."
mid season lags,It's an exciting show. Entirely unique and fresh with just the right amount of nostalgia but 7 episodes in there's a lot that HASN'T happened and this is unforgivable for a weekly show that thrives on mystery in two separate timelines. I've my hopes on it and I'm hoping for a second season but they'll need to step up the game.
Off to a great start! Love the premiere episode!,"I'm watching the first episode now and it's very exciting so far. Humor, intrigue, excitement! I can't wait to see what will happen next! The acting is great and everyone seems well cast."
Season 2 Drop-off,"It seems I'm not the only one disappointed in season 2. Season 1 was great. You were left with questions at the end of the season but still received some answers as well. However, season 2 just got out of hand super quickly. More and more questions arose and no previous questions got answered. The season just kept rolling like this causing a loss of character development and decent plot line. I understand the mystery is 'what's going on'? Is there a supernatural element or are we dealing with insanity due to circumstance? That's fine but you need to build up the story and develop the characters. To me, this all just got dropped in season 2. I have to chalk it up to terrible writing. It's so disappointing since season 1 was great. I hope a bounce back can be made in season 3, although I think the show has already lost quite a few viewers due to the season 2 bust."
Fantastically Written,"This series was just insane! I really hate when people call something ""slow"" simply because it's lacking action. Yeah, if all you want is action, then you'll probably not like the beginning of the series. Personally, I like to watch things that have intelligence to them. I find blasting nonstop action to be ""boring,"" so I guess I'm the opposite. Yellowjackets is HARDLY slow, though. I was engaged the entire time and I absolutely could not stop watching. The show is a psychological thriller, so it's supposed to keep you thinking, which the writers never fail to do. I can't wait for the second season!"
Lots of promise with no delivery,"Pretty great acting and a really interesting and mysterious premise that would have made a fantastic mini-series. Instead the story has been stretched to a possible 5 season long arc of probable cliff hangers and quality drops were the mysteries keep coming and the answers are far and few between as this season has showed us.I honestly hope time proves me wrong and the whole thing ends well but this start has given me shaky faith to say the least.Props to both the '96 and '21 actors though, they nailed it."
Great Start,This is based off the pilot alone so far but it's off to a booming beginning. Two stories rolled into one bigger story keeps you bouncing back and forth and wanting to see where each one is going and how the first affects the 2nd. I don't find it confusing at all but I've read some other have found it so. I don't see how but to each their own.Can't wait to see where it's going!SweeZ.
"Superb Acting, Unsatisfying End","My real rating is a 6.5. I really like the premise of this show, and the acting is truly great, so I have no complaints there. The downside? I think this would have served better as a mini-series that wrapped up in one intense season. I don't want to have to sit through 3+ seasons to watch this story flesh out. As other reviews have said, it seems like the writers aren't sure what direction they want to take the show and which story they want to run with. Is it horror? Is it supernatural? Is it survival? Is it suspense? You get teased with supernatural elements that are quickly dropped & forgotten for several episodes, only to get a tiny tease of it again. The entire 1st season is a slow buildup that doesn't even end at the 10 minute series opening scene. The season ends with no answers as to how they suddenly decline into primal depravity, other than teases of answers. I wanted more out of an ending. All in all, I like the show, but I don't love it. I think the audience deserved more closure for a first season."
Drags... Episode 10 should have been like episode 3 or 4,"This series has a fantastic pilot, but the rest of the series is filler. If they had consolidated all the subplots from episodes 4~9 and had the finale be the halfway point it would fix the glacial pacing and repetitious foreshadowing. This is one of those show seasons that feels like its just setup for the next season."
Hooked so far,"Lord of the Flies in the Ontario wilderness instead of an island. Yesss. I'm interested in seeing how this goes! Think it's going to be intense, gut wrenching, etc. Misty is already a creep."
This is actually pretty good. Surprised but enjoyed it,"So, we were searching for a new show to watch and knew basically nothing about this series. As it turns out, it's pretty well written and has an intriguing story and good acting. We have completed almost all of season 1 and now are eagerly waiting for season 2. A good mix of intrigue and mystery and drama with good acting, this is a thumbs up/watch in my humble opinion."
Dark fascinating story,"A group of teenagers in extreme survival situation. How far are they ready to go to stay alive? Is there a supernatural force taking control over them, or is it all in their heads? How do they handle the trauma after being rescued?The story is really thrilling and at times blood-freezing. I like that the characters are complex and far from being angels. Most of the actors do amazing job. Melanie Lynskey and Christina Ricci add so much charisma to their characters. As for the younger cast, I see big potential in Sophie Thather and Ella Purnell and would love to see them in different projects.I liked season 1 better than season 2, because in the latter some plot lines are abandoned and some are not so interesting or unnecessary. Nevertheless, my general impression is still very good and I'm looking forward to next season."
"If you're watching because the opening scene gripped you, turn your TV off!","Regardless of the other reviews, know one thing, if you are waiting for the opening scene of season 1, be known, it NEVER comes.It takes slow burner to a new dimension. It's just a bunch of women saying things like 'we did terrible things' or 'nobody can ever find out' but I'm coming to the end of season 2 and I'm still waiting. The intrigue of the endless remorse scenes grips you, and episode after episode ends with a 'when is the going to get good!!'It's a cool story, and make no mistake the acting is so so good. But my lord, the main storyline is middle age women struggling with .... Middle age life, then cutting back to sitting In a hut with a fire.The opening scene was the best part of the series, and assuming they can't drag that out to 3 seasons, the end of season 2 may eventually get to it."
This series isn't perfect but I still loved it,"Yellowjackets (2021) is a series that I started when it first began and just recently finished. It's available on the Showtime App and Peacock. The storyline follows a high school girl's soccer team whose plane crashes in the wilderness. The series depicts both how they survived in the forest and how those events impacted their lives as adults.This series was cocreated by Ashley Lyle and Bart Nickerson, who also worked together on Narcos, and stars Juliette Lewis (Natural Born Killers), Christina Ricci (Black Snake Moan), Melanie Lynskey (Don't Look Up), Sophie Thatcher (The Book of Bobba Fett), Kevin Alves (Locke & Key) and Tawny Cypress (Brooklyn's Finest).The storyline for this is written very well in how it mixes previous and current events. The characters and circumstances are unique, fascinating and unveiled to the audience at the appropriate pace. The flashback scenes in the woods are outstanding. There's times you find yourself thinking get back to that storyline. The present day storyline gets better as the film unfolds. Christina kills this performance and is very good as her character. You can say the same about Juliette Lewis and Melanie Lynskey (who was also great in Castle Rock). The chemistry and dynamics between characters is very well delivered. The last two episodes are worth the journey of watching this series. I didn't expect this to get trippy but it does.Overall, this series isn't perfect but I still loved it. They can go in so may directions from here and I can't wait for season 2. I would score this an 8-8.5/10 and strongly recommend it.Yellow Jackets: Season 2 (2023) is a series my wife and I recently finished watching on Showtime. The storyline picks up where season 1 left off with Shauna trying to cover up her boyfriend by any means necessary due to the information he's obtained. Misty and Natalie having been separated and Natalie isn't doing so well, while Misty has a new love interest. 👀 One of the missing from the group returns and tries to bring all the remaining survivors from the crash back together to show them the way through her new cult...I'll be honest, I thought it would be tough for Season 2 to match the intensity and unique elements presented in Season 1...but the writers hit the nail on the head. The overall concept of the survivors of the crash dying while trying to survive or after surviving, but the outcome remains the same just the timeline changes, and tying those two timelines together was amazing. This series does a really good job keeping past tense and current states equally as interesting. This series also does a great job of showing the characters mindsets and the impact on their lives. Elijah Wood (Lord of the Rings) being added to the cast was outstanding. His performance was over the top good and impactful within the primary storyline. The cult aspects added to this season was the one part that was a big miss for me, especially in the final episode (even if I loved the finale). I'd also say the detectives being buffoons was a bit out there. Ricci, Lewis and Lynskey once again knock their performances absolutely out of the park. The last two episodes were a 10/10.Overall, this is one of my favorite active series and I can't wait for Season 3. I would score this season equal to Season 1, a 9/10."
I LOVED IT !!!!,"It's been a really long time since I've felt this strongly about a show, especially after only watching the pilot episode.I am so anxious and curious to find out what's gonna happen next to these girls/women. I'm a huge fan of movies where people get stranded somewhere and must fight to survive (Frozen, The Canyon, Alive, Open Water).I don't normally like shows with a ton of flashbacks but I know with Yellowjackets it's necessary to tell the story. I want to know EVERY detail of what went on after the plane crash in the wilderness.I'm super intrigued and excited by this delightful new show and it sucks that I have to wait a week to see the next episode."
Christina Ricci perfect to that role!,"As always Christina Ricci nailed this role! She is such a talented actress. She portrsit it so realistic with her face expressions and even bodylanguage. Juliette Lewis is also perfect to her character. I cant wait for season 2,3,4... etc! Keep it coming!"
Second season is an insult to the first!,"Couldn't have been more disappointed with the second season - especially after such a strong start and all that was built in the first season.All the work that was put into creating the characters, and the tension surrounding the mystery of their circunstances, was all utterly destroyed - and each episode gets rapidly worse and worse.You'd be better off watching the first season, and then switching off and just using your imagination to what could be in store, rather than see the descent into utter madness. It is a painful watch.Do not watch it you want to keep your love of the first season intact. There is no pay off or reward for sticking through it."
Season 1: A+. Season 2: C -,Season two was like having a new writer every week that never read the previous episodes. Filler episodes with quick to end storylines. Spend six episodes on one subject then just quickly end it. At first I thought I just wasn't smart enough to follow along then I realized this was just bad writing. I'm fine with just ending it here. Such good writing with first season. Wouldn't mind a Walter and Misti spin-off . Another victim of second season slump. So embarrassed I recommended this for people to watch after season two. I will say the casting and song choices for soundtrack are amazing. Great acting.
Oh what a perfect balance,"This show has heart, humor, horror, and it jolts you back and forth through two timelines, effectively chronicling the impact of trauma at such a young age carried through adulthood. The earlier time period shows how the structured hierarchy of a privileged, talented high school girls soccer team quickly devolves for the sake of survival in the wilderness. You care about the plight of these characters, so you are comforted to see some of them in the present-day timeline as functioning adults. However, you quickly realize that it is all a facade and that the experience has left deeper scars than any of them would care to admit. Kudos to the younger cast, as they are all solid, giving us outstanding performances. Then we get the bonus of their adult versions being portrayed by none-other-than veteran actresses, the damsels of the 90s - Juliette Lewis, Christina Ricci, Melanie Lynskey, who are a hoot together. I have not seen casting this perfect in a long time, and with an actual good storyline presented in a way that keeps you captivated, ""Yellowjackets"" without a doubt is one of the top shows to come out in 2021."
"Not perfect, but absolutely addictive!","After binging season 1 and 2, I can say that I love this show. Is it perfect? No, but is great for what it is? Yes!For a show that is blending several genres together, I think it's doing very well. I also love that if you pay attention, there are lots of little easter eggs and references, that once you pick up on and research, add a whole other layer of depth to the show, characters and purposes.Yellowjackets is a blend of a deep drama, survival, mystery, horror, thriller, with it's tibits of black and quirky comedy, and truly disturbing moments.In terms of whether this show is a slow burn - yes and no. Once the plane crashes, things really kick off. I personally feel that in every episode from Season 1 Ep 2 onwards that there is always something engaging going on in every episode; usually one or more things at the same time, and it's all relevant. So it doesn't feel slow to me. However, I can appreciate that in terms of the bigger picture of the whole story unravelling and simultaneously the future as well - it is a slow burn. If you're expecting explanations, and the bigger, more gnawing mystery being solved and handed on a plate to you, then this isn't the show for you. Incremental reveals are made overtime. They feel worth it to me. I personally can't wait for season 3 to see what will unfold in the greater mystery, and furthermore in understanding these characters better!Every actor does a phenomenal performance in their role. I was brought to tears and shaking from several scenes. One thing for certain about this show is that it is heavily themed around trauma, and what can happen when extreme trauma is ignored or not given care and early intervention. We see the past traumas still very much alive in the survivors of Yellowjackets, and how these traumas age manifesting in each person uniquely.One question remains for me, did they create something together... or, was there something already there?I hope you find this show as engaging and thought-provoking as I have! I revommend avoiding spoilers too."
Definitely lord of the flies but creepier,"I love this. It's the genre I didn't know I was missing in my life. Horror/thriller/muster/realistic fiction all in one. It's got super dark and creepy vibes, especially the first two episodes so far, but I don't want to turn it off and can't stop watching it. It's definitely a love or hate kind of show."
Disturbing. Messed up. Vile. Violent. Sick. But....,I LOVE it!!! Who would have thought a show about a woman's soccer team crash landing in the middle of nowhere manage to successfully be an engrossing horror series?? This thing is incredible!!! 3 episodes in and Sunday can't come soon enough!!! Showtime you've blown mind!! Between this and Yellowstone Sunday's kick ass!!!Strongly Recommended!!! If you can stomach it you will love it!!! If you appreciate good horror then this should do the trick!!!
Had potential but it let me down...,"With this cast And this premise, I really wanted to like this show. However, it just wasn't enough for me. Plot holes, lack of suspense, corny dialogue and lack of emotion. I'm not entirely sure where this premise took a nose dive for me but I can tell you I didn't feel an ounce of horror. There was so suspense on my end. It was dull and I can't believe I made it through all of these episodes. The ending was so lackluster and gave us next to no pay off. I don't know if I even care what happens in season 2 if there is one. This was lazy writing, it had such potential."
"So far, so intriguing.","Quality acting and interesting storylines - although, admittedly, I think the 90s segments were more interesting, and could have probably carried the show on their own. It's a very slow burner, and it has me hooked.If I'm honest, I was originally only here for Christina Ricci, and how good her award worthy performance was supposed to be - it totally is. But the cast at large is very good.I'm a little disappointed that people are asking, nay demanding in some reviews, for the series to progress more quickly. I hope Showtime are committed to taking the show at the creators pace - also I disagree with some reviewers that call that the show be more specifically horror, supernatural, or suspense.Here's looking forward to Season 2."
Tale of 2 storyline's....one good. One boring.,"Put simply the teenage version where they are lost in the woods is actually quite compelling to watch. There is an entire season or more worth there that they could have done a different ""lord of the flies"" type thing.When they are adults things grind to a boring halt tbh.They should have done the entire season on when they were young girls lost in the woods and doubled down in the whole Occult/demon thing tbh.Missed opportunity."
100% Worth the Watch.,"This is a great show. It's a far cry from much of the analytics based content we get from companies like Netflix. Hopefully, ""Yellowjackets,"" can wrap up the main storylines in a way that is satisfactory and doesn't fall prey to ""Dexter syndrome."" By, ""Dexter Syndrome,"" I mean the show is great until its conclusion.""Yellowjackets"" is a slow burn and is more subtle than shows like ""Stranger Things"" and ""Harold and Kumar Go to White Castle"" whose writers choose to slam plot points down your throat. Look at ""Better Call Saul"" if you want an example of things not really happening for the first couple of seasons but still being an amazing show start to finish.The show might not be for you, but it's a shame to at least not give it a try. My expectations were very low, and it became one of my favorite shows of recent memory. It has some intelligent writing with time jumps that can be tough to do correctly but, in my mind, aren't excessively obtrusive. The show fluidly goes between two main timelines and several other ones to explain the story. Yes, we do immediately see them being all cannibal tribed out in the very first scene, which I can appreciate some criticism in regard to this issue since cannabalism doesn't happen at all in the first season. I, however, feel it is a good cliffhanger how they ended season one at the start of winter and with a main character dying from hypothermia. This cliffhanger sets up season two well, and enough happened in season one that I'm very happy with it. This cliffhanger gives us the descent into madness to look forward to in season two. Also, season two's premiere was great, so I'm looking forward to it.Sit back and enjoy the ride. Writers don't always have to give you exactly what you want immediately, or at all, for a show to be good."
Addictive and ambitious but flawed,"""Yellowjackets"" is addictive like a drug, very well-made, exceptionally well-acted by all, almost perfectly cast in matching the younger with the older versions of the same characters (with one exception: Juliette Lewis, whose performance is very good but I never really felt I was watching the same person as Sophie Thatcher was playing as a teen; the teen version was cooler and more positive), with some remarkably genuine portrayals of teenage girls friendships, especially between Jackie and Shauna. At the end of each episode, you immediately want to start the next one. BUT.....there is also something irritating about the way the showrunners keep stringing you along, teasing things in the Pilot that STILL haven't happened when the season ends! ""Yellowjackets"" season 1 could be described as the longest cinematic foreplay ever; the ending is disappointing as it resolves just one mystery while adding about five new ones (this tactic did not work for ""Lost"" in the long run). Also, the 1996-1997 scenes are definitely more compelling than the ""present"" storyline, though the writers do manage a shocking twist in the latter regarding the identity of the blackmailer (and Christina Ricci, especially, is fantastic). If the show had stayed more in the past and had finished a complete season arc, I might have given it an 8 or even a 9 out of 10, now it's a 7 (I probably would have cut out the two major male characters of the past as well, to give it a more unusual all-girl dynamic). Will I be watching season 2 when it comes? Sure....but in a lot more impatient mood for concrete answers and events."
5/10. Not recommended,"Firstly, it tricks you it's gonna be a horror tv show. Then it tricks you it's gonna be a good tv show.It's neither of those.This is a teenage comedy/drama with some horror elements. At first, it works, but the last 4 episodes are truly awful. They are also cringe and unintentionally funny, almost like a parody of the former episodes.Even acting gets worse.Unbelievable things happen, people act out of character, the show is becoming ridiculous and it's such a pity, because all the good actors and fine music are being wasted.Why did this show become so dumb? I mean, it wasn't a masterpiece, but the first half was watchable and entertaining.The last episode is pure -unintentionally- comedy. A person dies and it is the most stupid death in the history of television. Instead of feeling sadness, i bet that every viewer is gonna burst out laughing.Juliette Lewis, Warren Kole, Samantha Hanratty, Christina Ricci and some others are doing a good job here. Actors are not the problem in this show."
"What, there's no book club?!?","Yellowjackets is great. Really good story telling. Dramatic, scary at times and surprisingly funny. Christina Ricci is amazing but all the acting is strong."
Great,"Finally, something good, I love it. Good mistery, good actors, interestting personal lives, not over the top gore, just what I want, not a moment of boredom. I hope will be good untill the end."
So friggin good.. I'm obsessed!!!!,"Awesome show, great story and even better acters. Juliette Lewis is always the best as well as Christina Ricci. It's has started off with a bang and the mystery keeps getting darker and darker. Can't wait for the next episode!!"
Confusing,It's like pretty little liars meets lost meets some generic teen drama. In the midst of starvation a boy and a girl are arguing about some guy she slept before him. That is very confusing to me. It's like the writers aren't familiar with Maslow needs hierarchy.Also a lot of things get teased in the first episode which don't happen.
Movie Premyy Honest Review,"A mixture of Horror, Humour, Mystery, Human Emotions, Psychic Power, etc. Subplots, Character developments, Music, and Performances are the highlights of the show but it is slow with lots of s*x, violence, intense scenes and gets darker with each episode which makes you uneasy so watch at your own risk. Can not wait for more. Highly Recommended! 🔥"
"Strong cast, poor writing","I had originally given this series a 9 after Season 1. The plot, characters, music, writing and acting was fantastic. I don't understand what happened with Season 2. It could have been the opportunity to showcase more back stories of the characters, or show more of how they were forced to survive in the wilderness. Instead it focused on the same plot point and introduced or highlighted characters nobody cares about. Why is the Coach getting so much screen time? Who are all the Yellowjacket players that randomly show up in season 2? The extensive character development in Season 1 disappears in season 2 and honestly the women just become annoying to watch. Such a strong cast of female actors and their talents were completely wasted in Season 2 with minimal range and dragging storylines. I hope there is a Season 3 so there is the chance for writers to redeem themselves, but with the quality of Season 2 I won't hold my breath."
One of the best shows in a long time,"Keeps you on the edge of your seat, no dull moment here. Clever storyline and you never know what bad will happen next. Amazing very likable actors, except of course , Misty."
Why isn't it better?,"4 episodes in and I don't quite know why this show isn't much better than it is.Great plot, well directed, beautifully shot, good acting and a really great soundtrack, but it seems to fall short.Maybe it's the disconnect between some of the teen actors and their grown up counterparts - it's not easy to know who's meant to be who. Maybe it's the fact that very few of the characters are easy to empathise with - they're all quite dislikeable.I've given it 7/10 in the hope that improves along the way."
Two episodes in and I am absolutely hooked.,"I gotta admit watching the pilot I was kinda skeptical about this show. I was expecting something along the lines of Lord of the Flies meets Desperate Housewives. But getting introduced to the characters, both adults and teens, and watching the second episode I am very hopeful about this one.The acting is very very good, I especially like teen Misty, and the story is intriguing. You can count me in for the ride. I like to see where they plan to take us."
Good But Could Be ALOT Better,The first season starts off pretty intense and keeps you interested. There is a lot of filler and maybe a little too much unnecessary story lines that really don't affect what the show is trying to put out. Creepy enough to keep you intrigued but would like to see a lot more of the wilderness scenes instead of the modern day stuff.Season 2 I found to be disappointing. Season 1 was decent and had enough intrigue to keep you going in wanting more answers. Season 2 has way too much filler trying to show the effects the girls endured in the past and how it's affecting them 25 years later. I found a lot of parts of season 2 we're just way too boring. Need to see more Wildeness scenes. 2 seasons is enough to fill in some of the gaps left by the droll storylines of season 2All in all it's a good show but they hold it back from being great.
I wont be returning,This show completely falls flat for the entire season. It reminded me of some crappy 90s show on network tv. I saw no highs or even lows. Teenage girls dancing lile a cliche valley girls after a serious plane wreck is lunacy. The adult sections are boring and bland. The teenage stuff is basically highschool drama set in the wilderness. This show really brings nothing to the table besides drama. Honestly two days from now I'll have completely forgotten about it. They also decided to milk this melodrama for another season. Cliff hanger nonsense. If this sounds like something you want to watch then by all means check it out. Otherwise head in some other direction.
This is my favorite show now,"It's very dark, disturbing and gory. But for me, it's worth all that for how good it is. Not only is it wildly entertaining, it's also very layered. The kind of show where you pick up new things with every watch.The acting is amazing, the story is amazing, and I love the actors.Just go in expecting a horror series, not just a survival show. There is plenty of dark comedy as well... some really hilarious moments. I don't know what else to say without giving spoilers... just give it a chance. I am obsessed."
Didn't think I'd like it... 1 episode and I'm addicted,"I can't remember the last time a show had me so completely hooked from the pilot. I can't wait for more episodes. And to think, I almost passed it up because the plot sounded thoroughly uninteresting to me.I can't say much about the series as a whole, only the first episode is out so far. But I would really like to encourage others to check it out. I was totally engrossed and eager for more by 30 minutes in, a huge feat for a series.I dont think I could possibly do it justice if I tried to describe it because what's so great about it is the execution. So often, you have rich material that's unfortunately mishandled and ill-explored... that is NOT the case here. It's a thing of beauty to witness the opposite - content that could easily be kitch, perfectly realized in every aspect. And most importantly, a good soundtrack. Expertly shot and edited with superb sound effects and placement that constantly remind you of the razors edge at your throat. Even the mundane teen life scenes have an underlying tension that reminds you of what's to come. It also serves as a decent bit of time travel for those of us who were teens in the US in the 90's. You won't know from the descriptions if you'll enjoy it because the way its done is what's so great about it but you'll know in one episode if it's your bag, so why not try it?"
"Good psychological thriller, but it's more than that","I like the show, psychological thriller with bits of supernatural evils added in. But I will say the girls are pretty stupid haha. They are facing starvation in the wild and they are throwing parties and playing in the lake. And the first episode is very hard to watch for anyone who knows anything about soccer, but with that said I enjoyed the show and its theme."
Umbro soccer shorts - oh yes,"I didn't know what to expect when I first started watching but I am NOT disappointed. I've never seen a show like this and I'm so happy I took a chance. A girls soccer team turned wilderness survivors turned adult brings shock, suspense, and a super plot."
"Great season followed by ""not bad"" season","The first part was good, but the second part did not live up to expectations
I liked the acting performance, it was consistent throughout the two seasons, but the problem was the plot
I think it could have been better
Misty was wonderful as a character, and the acting performance of both actresses who played her role, whether as a young woman or as a woman, was wonderful.Why did Ben act this way, a good person could turn into a murderer if you were put in force majeure, but not so quickly
In general, whoever followed the first part and is looking forward to following the second part will be somewhat disappointed."
I watched them all in a row and it was great,"Yellowjackets is an awesome show. One of the major complaints that people have is that it moves to slowly. I watched one a day after the season aired and didn't notice anything until I read reviews. If you're reading my review now, it means you have the opportunity to binge it. Definitely do it. Performances are great, writing is clever and engaging. There is no forced political correctness, all the characters feel genuine and even the ones you think you'll hate turn out to be likeable!"
Plot holes are hard to overcome,We have to accept that a pack of wolves disappear when one is killed away from the rest that are attacking the girls.We have to accept that an abandoned plane that has vines growing all over it will have a functioning battery still fully charged to allow it to start.We have to accept that despite being stranded on a deserted mountain hundreds of miles from civilization that there is a large cabin in great shape to house them with furnishings .These plot holes are huge and despite the great premise that gives rise to this series it is a lot to ask the viewer to disregard .
Better than expected,I went into this with zero expectations. From the first episode I was hooked. I love all the character development and the mystery. I can't wait for the rest of thr season!
Enjoyable,"A few days ago I started watching and was immediately drawn in. At about the 4th episode (Season 1) I came to IMDB to check some names, that's when I found out the scheming.girl with the funny curly hair is played by Christina Ricci. What a transformation, wouldn't have recognized her in a million years! Some afterthoughts... 1) I was really surprised that when the first kill was being dissected, no voice of disgust was raised by someone in the group. No vegans back then? 2) The actors appeared well-fed with plump cheeks. Stranded in the wilderness without food but without weight loss? Hmm..***"
Get to the point already,Struggling to get into this. Have been slowly watching it but my attention has wavered on many occasion.It keeps building to something. But I don't know what and I'm rapidly losing interest.Something about some creepy beings or spirits in the woods that led to them killing each other or something. Boring. Up to ep6 doubt if I will go much further. The cast is good - that's all.
Immensely Addictive,"I had initially watched 2 episodes of the first season and had forgotten about the show thereafter, until recently when I decided to rewatch the show. I cannot believe I had slept on such an amazing show. The first season was brilliant, it was dark and had just the right amount of mystery, drama and humor to carry each episode alongside the actors. The second season was nothing short of brilliant and luckily did not fall into the slump that some second season shows tend to fall into. All of the actors deserve recognition, but the two main actors that stood out for me; Natalie (Juliette Lewis) and Misty (Christina Ricci) the depth of emotion that they both added to their characters makes them some of the most memorable characters in my personal opinion. I cannot wait to see what the 3rd season brings, alas we have to wait until 2025. I would definitely recommend this show to anyone who loves mystery, supernatural, psychological thrillers."
"Good music, wrong year","Love the show, but the music doesn't match 1996. Pretty distracting if you were a teenager of the 90's and know that the soundtrack is not realistic..maybe it was not that important to the creators."
Multi mix of genres and great characters buzz brilliantly. But for how long?,"I'm pretty jaded when it comes to TV shows now. Usually I would watch or try to watch a first episode, and more often than not, I can't get past the pilot. But when a series holds my attention and gets me hooked enough to bingewatch, that's when I really appreciate it.Yellowjackets does just that. Mixing a survival story with a modern day mystery, a psychological thriller, a supernatural horror AND a coming of age story, these elements blend in seamlessly. It does something similar to the series The Haunting of Hill House, in which it has a cast of characters, both straight and gay and all have their different ways of coping with a traumatic event. And so have to deal with the past biting back at them.I also love the casting in this film. The majority of the main actresses who play the older version of the characters rose to stardom in the 1990s and have become extremely underrated since then. Christina Ricci in particular shines as this smiling psychopathic nutso who loves being in control of things - whether it's bad or good.The series present two separate mysteries. In the 90s in the wildness, who is the girl who is killed and eaten by her fellow teammates? And in the present day, who is the blackmailer(s) who may have killed a friend of theirs and threatening them? While at the beginning, the mystery unfolds brilliantly enough to keep the viewer interested, by the end, it loses its steam a bit - mostly owing to the weak twists and U-Turns that made us think one thing, only for it to be something else entirely. The sacrificed girl has a heart necklace, but it gets switched around from one girl to the next, so to keep her identity a secret.Although I do love the lesbian characters and their relationships - while Taissa's sexuality is rightly seen as completely normal in the present day, I kind of doubt it would have been so easily accepted in the 1990s.Also, the series ends on a massive cliffhanger. And I will be very disappointed if this doesn't get a second season like so many other great shows have fallen victim to."
Nat is dead but only for a few minutes,"Ok I have the season finale all figured out. Natalie is dead but not from what you might think and not for long. After finding the folder in lotte's office nat knew she was crazy. Her and misty like Van and Tai shared a secret meeting that we as the viewers did not see. Misty and Natalie had a plan. Natalie got a new queen of hearts card burned the edges and put it in her pocket. Her coat pocket that her hands never left the entire scene. Shauna was not supposed to pull the card. The idea was to have nat pick the card that she planted and misty would inject her with heroin. Being that nat was a drug user and has done this before she knew exactly the correct amount for misty to fill the syringe. Misty's hands were brown not from lottes blood but from the syringe of heroin. An ambulance was never called to pick up lotte. Van and Tai called it off. The ambulance was for nat. Nat and misty set it in motion. The emt has the narcan ready. Lottie thinks the wilderness got what it wanted because Natalie is dead. But she won't be for that long. Problem is when you die for only a short time before you are brought back to life you see things you didn't believe were real. Travis wrote "" you were right nat"" that was never met for nat to interpret she was right about what she saw when she first overdosed. He couldn't have written that he would have already been dead. Nat has been right all along..... but about Lottie."
Insane,I had no clue what I was watching when I started the first episode. It didn't take long to get hooked. I just binged all 4 episodes that are available and don't wanna stop watching.
Does it really deliver?,"I have mixed feelings after watching the pilot.Like they're trying too hard to create tension and suspense, mystery, dread and so on, but it's not quite there. Dialogues feel forced, interactions don't feel organic all that much. It's hard to establish 5-6 separate characters in 2 or 3 separate timelines and it's even harder to connect of all this into one hour long episode.Lots of flashbacks, action takes place in present time, in the past and before the actual ""main"" events in the past. The show is trying to combine A LOT of story lines all at once and it's hard to feel engaged in either one of them. There's just too much stuff going around.Another thing is with the attire girls had after they crashed and were fighting for survival. So you basically crashed and were stranded, but you had time to create elaborate ceremonial head dresses out of bones, skulls, nets, twigs? What for? It doesn't make sense, but it's more ""cinematic"" I guess.I want to see how the story develops, maybe it'll get better, because right now it's all over the place."
Can't wait to see how this unfolds,"I wasn't sure if the plot of this initially. The beginning events in the first minute are "" weird "", but after finishing the first episode, i can't wait to see how this whole story will unfold. I really need to know what happened in the woods now. I just hope it doesn't get too over the top. I have to say the casting is one of the main reason i gave 10 stars. The older current day version of the teenagers is spot on. Especially Shaunas character. I mean 2021 version legit looks just like teen one would like 25 years later. The teenaged girls acting is superb and i love the 90's vibe as well. But great show so far and i can't wait till next Sunday !"
"Season one was great, what happen season 2?","I thought the first season was great. Being born in the 80s and grew up in the 90s, I always appreciate movies and shows that take place in these time periods. The clothes, the hair, the MUSIC. Although we don't get much of the latter due to them being crashed in the wilderness, you really feel the 90s up to till then. Season one is interesting, nicely paced plot and somewhat likable characters. You're curious to see how and when and how they slip into total feral, mask wearing lord of flies (by a flashback scene I believe in episode one). But it never happen by the end of the season, other than their trippy shroom night; which I thought was a bit much...but anywho. Maybe season 2?Nope. Season 2 begins to lose all its steam and becomes a boring repeat of nothingness with our adult actors. I found the flashbacks settings, actresses and story much more interesting than our adult characters. I feel they could have wrapped all 9 episodes into 1. The whole Lottie cult in NY just never stops. The daughter, who is in HIGH SCHOOL, is now full blow covering for murder that her mother committed to the guy she was cheating on with her father, without so much do a blink of an eye. Mind you, they had absolutely no relationship not even a couple weeks before she finds all this out. Yeah right.As for the characters? Most are ok. Natalie as a teenager is probably my favorite. I liked Jackie as well. I've always like Christina Ricci and find her adult Misty corky and spunky enough to get humor and entertainment out of...and that's about it. The worst offender being Shauna. As a teenager and an adult. There is absolutely no redeeming quality to this character. She's cheating with her bffs boyfriend, knocked up by him and of course hiding it from her. She then somehow turns it on Jackie for finding out and being upset, leaving her to sleep outside in a frozen tundra. They then watch as she almost murders Lottie...get out her anger? I'm still confused by this scene and how it was just totally ok with everyone. Flash forward to modern time and....she's still cheating! She then murdered the innocent dude and manipulated everyone around her to make it seem like he was the ""bad guy"". She's not funny, sarcastic, particularly mean or a bad ass....she's just unpleasant, in every way.I'm also not digging this supposed ""darkness"" this symbol that's everywhere but not on ounce of what it is or explanation, was a mysterious at first, now I'm sick of it.This show started great, such a let down in season 2. I don't think it can be saved in season 3."
@sleepyratingscale- wide awake,"So season 2 is currently going on. I got into this show last year when it originally came out. It's like a mix of Lost, the book Lord of the Flies, and the 1993 movie Alive about the Uruguayan rugby team that crash landed in the Andes and took to cannibalism to stay alive. My hope is that Yellow Jackets actually explains what is happening instead of leaving a lot of crap unanswered like Lost did. I still don't understand why they were pushing that damn button on Lost or why there was a polar bear on the island. Anyway season one of Yellow Jackets was interesting and brought up a lot
of questions about what happened to these youth after they crash landed. What means did they result to, to survive?!"
First Season,"Why I think this show is so cool?It is an female all star coming of age mistery drama driven, yet.... is not woke.Characters are diverse (racially, sexually, etc) yet it is not preachy. The writers do not treat women as some pretext for some idiological stunt but they are real people who make mistakes and horrible things (you know, as most people do)
The cast is incredible, both the teens and the adults.The 1996 story captures the 90s vibes at point:
Teens are unapologetic, smart and on your face.I am hooked.And hoping the writers keep up the good work."
Horror/Suspense at a snails pace,"Imagine watching Friday the 13th... except Jason doesn't kill anyone until the 7th movie. That's, unfortunately, how I've felt watching the show so far. 6 episodes in and the mysteries are still mysterious, and what little mysteries there are I'm finding myself not caring as much as I once did after the first 2 episodes. The present parts have only been fun to watch for Christina Ricci, who does an amazing job as a friendly psychotic nurse and Aiden Stoxx, the son of Taissa, who's straight out of a Jordan Peele horror.The past parts I want to like, trying to find out where it all went wrong since the first episode doesn't hide their decent into barbarism out in the woods. But the ever growing teen drama that I hoped the show would steer away from and slow progression through every day has gotten hard to watch. The characters are out there for 19 months... are we really going to see every day of this? Is this show going to be 57 seasons?? (19 x 10 = 570). Really hoping this 2nd half is more engaging."
Trauma,"This show has one of the best character study's of trauma in a very long time (also might be some of the best content coming out of Showtime since.... EVER).It deserves the praise it's garnering right now. There are some issues I can see people would glower over, like tugging the audience with more questions than answers, or suspension on genre and tropes it's running with, is it supernatural or NOT?I disagree, the pacing is good, it doesn't leave the audience confused with unending questions like the producers of 'Lost' or EPIX's 'From.' It establishes early in the premise, something terrible happened further than a plane crash, something dark, they can't tell the public, the whole dramatic arc is the mystery of their secret. The twist is, the answer also sits in with these messed up older selves, the personalities that cannot function beyond the tribal society they established in the wilderness.Trauma, how to not carry it through space and time, or how we doom ourselves to repeat it."
Only the strong (or most cunning) will survive,This is like Lord of the Flies - if Lord of the Flies was a girls soccer team and it was set in the 1990s! Killer soundtrack (no pun intended). It's a look at human behavior in an intense survival situation and the eventual anarchy that always follows on from our dark and twisted actions and choices. Rules will be made and broken. There will be a fight for power no doubt and lots of death and secrets. I can't wait to see how it all plays out. Loving every second.
"Some criticisms are valid, but personally I loved it","The premise was really intriguing and I finally got around to watching this show. First episode gives us a glimpse into the ""horrible thing they did"" that the characters CONSTANTLY being up but never elaborate on. It makes it real interesting and makes you want to watch to see how the survivors devolve into such a state. So the storyline is split up between two stories: 1996 with the team trying to survive while dealing with angsty teenage bull, and the present, with the surviving girls dealing with uninteresting family drama in their personal lives and a mysterious threat that seems to be trying to dredge up the past. So, the strongest parts are showing the team trying to survive in the wilderness, and the present day women trying to find who is behind some weird stuff happening in the present. The weakest parts of the show are easily all the marital problems some of the women are facing in the present. Generic affair happens with Shauna that seems to be heading in one direction, but at the end went in an unexpected direction, so I will give it that. Tai's wife being the typical nagging wife who's all ""our son is acting out and it's all your fault because you are not home 24/7"" and refuses to hold her son accountable for ANYTHING, like dam chill girl. Nat was fine, and I loved the character of Misty, easily the funniest and most interesting character in the whole show. However, in the past, the character of Travis was just the most ANNOYING character in the whole show. Dude is angtsy AF the ENTIRE show. Literally as soon as the plane crashes he's all ""leave me alone I need to be alone and brooding"" and im over here like, you sure this is the best time to be a huge d**k to everybody because you are all emo or whatever? There are way more important things to worry about. It made no sense whatsoever and it was grating to have to watch this while I just wanted to see how the rest of the group was doing. Meanwhile Nat keeps going after him even though he is an ass, and then of course the two bestest friends have secrets that doesn't end well. And the amount of girls that are crazy AF in ONE soccer time is startlingly high, but I suppose that makes things interesting.I will say that season 1 doesn't tell the whole story, you won't see them at the point of the first episode, but it sets it up to get there in the next season, I know that kind of thing annoys a lot of people. However, the finale had some interesting reveals that sets up the next season and introduces some new elements at play.I know I mostly talked about my complaints, but overall for me, the good definitely outweighs the bad. The story of the struggle for survival is great, and the desire to see these girls descend into full on madness compels me to keep watching, even if it starts to get old when characters in the present keep calling it ""what we did"" or ""what happened"" instead of just saying it. The whole blackmail plot and doing detective work in the present was interesting, and because of something that is revealed at the very end, I think the present half of the show will get a lot better in season 2. So I will keep watching."
By far one of my favorites!,"This is one of my favorite shows. It has everything. Superstition, love, laughter, supernatural, cults, it's just simple amazing. Definitely worth the watch. I have watched this show multiple times. I can't get enough of it, I just hate waiting forever for another season. However, this show is on my top 10 and probably my third favorite show. It may have a slow start but after that each episode leaves you wanting more. Everytime you think you have it all put together, there's a twist. I keep questioning who is what and what is going to happen. It's just simply and awesome show. The characters and story also make this show amazing. They all played their parts extremely well."
It promised alot but delivered nothing.,"So this series has its own pros and cons. Let's about the pilot ep first, I would say it is one of the best ones. When I decided to give it a try, I was hooked and couldn't wait to see more, but I was busy. So I postponed it. After a month I came back to it and watched it all over again and finished it to the end.This show is full of surprises, but it didn't surprised me as much.Subplots, character developments and cinematography are the highlights of this show.This show is a mixture of humour mystery and horror. Talking about the mystery I felt like, it becomes less effective as the story progress, but that's fine because it kept hooked.The one thing which bothered me alot is they drag the story too much, with unnecessary filler subplots. This is one of those show seasons that feels like its just setup for the next season."
Jersey Girls Gone Wild!!,"Modern day ""Lord of the Flies"" with girls from New Jersey going animalistic and canabalistic.Superb acting from an ensemble cast. Cinematography is frenetic -- in a good way."
Why are plane crashes always ridiculous in movies ?,"Fuselage is almost intact. But the coach is trapped under the wing.Fuselage is almost intact. But one passenger isimpaled on a branch 20 meters in the air.Plane is about to crash. At the top of the trees. And pilots dump fuel....
...Guys, if you have no knowledge, hire someone who has."
This show is addicting!,I started watching it and the concept is so great from past to present. Getting to know all the girls and their survival in the middle of nowhere after the crash and it's so good i wish it was mostly more just about then survival aspect only but i understand they're trying to make the show crazy. I wish the show would release all the episodes at once cause its so bingewatchable and it sucks it's only 10 episodes but the season finale was abit of a good cliff hanger but i can't wait for season 2.
Fish do be existing,"They know they're near a lake right? Fish exist? Like not even the attempt to fish? IDK I gave it a chance, Episode 6 and I'm just confused.They had a decent premise and honestly a pretty scary introduction in the first two episodes, then briefly in the 4th it was kind of interesting again.I'm going to watch it all the way through, they already have been green lit for a season 2 so I just hope they streamline the story, getting tired of the random dating stuff & weird politics at home. It's weird she never goes to an office? Always just talking to her wife at home about the campaign?They did a decent job at getting me interested in some aspects of the show, only thing keeping me watching, but I really feel like this could have just been a more straightforward streamlined story rather than dragging it out as much as they have.Like I'm 6 hours into this show and I still don't understand anything about ""What They Did"" (beyond what they revealed in the first two episodes) despite ""What they did"" being mentioned so many times without anyone going into detail what so ever.I also want them to quit talking about what they ""did"" and actually show more of it as twisted as it was. I thought this show was supposed to be brutal, beyond the first two episodes it has been dull overall.Hopefully they can pull it together because it's genuinely different especially with how brutal at this point was willing to be."
Still waiting for something to actually happen...,"We're five episodes in now, and it's still treading water.It's just like a looooong and frankly boring introduction. We get the atmosphere, we get something happened, we get there are consequences in the characters' lives 25 years later. We got that from the first 10 minutes of the first episode. Hours of show later, the plot hasn't progressed in the slightest.Then what??? Why this endless dragging? I give it till the end of the episode I'm currently watching, then I'm out of here if nothing major has happened."
A slow burn but definitely worth watching,"Ok full disclosure I stopped and restarted this series because I couldn't get it into it at first.1. It is a SLOW burn with a lot of anticipation that can be a little frustrating at times.2. Series bares a LOT of similarities to ""Lost"" both in plot and structure. Obviously the circumstances are the same but every episode shows the back story of a main character and there are symbols, signs, mystery, and intrigue.3. The back and forth between present and past is engaging and people definitely not being who they appear keeps us guessing.4. Juliette Lewis is SO overrated as an actress and plays this role like 90% of her others, grumpy, mumbling, and ""rough"". Her performance is super tiresome and wears THIN.5. Christina Ricci and Melanie Lynsky are EXCELLENT! They both deserved their Emmy noms."
They did nothing wrong,"My girls did nothing wrong they were stranded with no hope of survival unless they started eating eachother and COME ON it wasn't even that bad like Shauna ate Jackie's ear but it's because she loves her and Jackie haunts her and now she's with Jeff who was Jackie's boyfriend but it's really only because she lost Jackie for this so she has to love him right? Wrong but that doesn't matter because Jeff loves her anyway and he's soooo loyal I love him a whole lot
I think more girls should have evil visions and go on hunting people sprees, Lottie did nothing wrong she's just a little schizophrenic and that's NOT her fault and the forest was evil:( it wasn't her fault:("
FASTEN YOUR SEATBELTS,I'VE JUST COMPLETED THE FIRST TWO EPISODES AND I'M HOOKED. THIS IS A DARK KIND OF STORY THAT KEEPS YOU GLUED TO YOUR SEAT AND KEEPS YOU WONDERING WHAT'S LURKING AROUND THE NEXT CORNER. IT'S AN INTERESTING SPIN ON A TRUE STORY ABOUT A MALE URUGUAYAN RUGBY TEAM WHOSE PLANE CRASHES INTO THE ANDES MOUNTAINS AND THE GRUESOME SURVIVAL DECISIONS THAT WERE MADE TO STAY ALIVE. I LOOK FORWARD TO SEEING WHERE THIS AMAZING STORY GOES.
AN UNEXPECTED HIT!!!,Everything about this show is a masterpiece. The pacing is amazing as it doesn't feel too fast or too slow. The mysteries are intriguing enough to keep you watching and the genre-bending is done flawlessly. The creepy and horror undertones are also just enough to give you goosebumps but increase as the show progresses. And finally the talented ensemble. The casting department struck gold with this show. Every single actor brings something amazing to the table which elevates the show to the next level. Definitely a must watch.
It's OK,"I just finished watching the first season. Its very very slow moving and I keep waiting for something else to happen. I like the cast and the acting is good but, it's extremely slow and some episodes are boring. Unfortunately, in order to find out what the heck is going on you will have to watch the next season. It's something to watch since there's nothing else on. If you have nothing else to watch then give it a try."
Waiting for S2,This Series Passed My Vibe And I Really Enjoyed And So Conflicted Story Telling And Unpredictable Story Narration. #WaitingS2.If you're A Evil dead fan Or any Dark thriller Fan i swear you u will Become One Of Us#Yellowjacket Fan.
Lord of the Yellow jackets?,The show is off to a great start. I'm very interested to see what went down after the plane crash but so far it is reminding me of the Lord of the Flies.
I'm Obsessed!!,"I was hooked from the start, I wish I could watch a new episode every day! It's agonizing waiting a week for a new episode. It's been 20 years since a show had me on pins and needles! Love the cast, the storyline and everything involved."
2nd season takes a nosedive!,"The first season was pretty good but somewhere in season 2 it developed into this feministic type of show that felt too girl power for me. Weird scenes that didn't make sense and it was a real chore to finish to the end, any interest I had in where the show was heading for the 3rd season got totally lost! I will definitely not be tuning in to see what develops next for this show! I was hoping it was revealed that they all died in the plane crash somehow and the wilderness kept them alive. Christina Ricci's character was probably done the best throughout the whole show but even that's not enough to make me want to see more."
Not as good as some reviews might say and nothing special or original,"I much prefer reading the synopsis to each episode which I did as well as watching 7 episodes. The show drags on, it is ALWAYS heavy, which is tiresome, and it's not an original concept - in fact I am surprised it hasn't been mentioned more about the original show Amazon had on literally last year where teen girls crash on an island and go all Lord of the Flies. Is this one done better than that one? They are equal in every way. I was disappointed and bored :("
LOST meets Riverdale...,"No wait, let me start over. LOST meets Riverdale meets Alive meets American Horror Story.Although I'm enjoying this by season 1, episode 5, I almost want to google for spoilers because I want to know what happens. In other words, this is frickin' addictive.I really want to know how they get from opening scene girl running in the snow in the wilderness... to trying to crack a murder mystery in the real world.I love the 90s costuming and props and mise en scène. It's not as spot on as Stranger Things (ooo that's another ...meets) but it's close enough. Mix tapes!!!The only thing I don't enjoy is the opening credits."
Brilliant,"First season is AWESOME. Can't wait for more!It has so many great elements:
high school drama and trauma at its best. ""THE MOTHERF#CKIN SAFETY IS OFF""serial killer-level darkness. ""The Caligula In"", ""It's bunny""extremely creepy at times, it has an elegant way to use sinking fear rather than cheap jump-scares. ""Were you eating dirt?""intruiging characters. I find myself debating in my head whether Misty is a psychopath or on the spectrum and whether Shaunas special talent is unusual or if its something true for anyone. Don't even get me started on Taissa or Lottie... Its good stuff. The flashbacks fits seamlessly into the adult characters adding vertigo-inducing depth.murder mystery which also isn't related to cannibalismteenage girls slowly turning feralthankfully its not as much sex scenes after the pilot. Can someone please fire the nasty perv who doesnt order shows if the pilot isn't sexual enough? I only watch series' which has a lot of sex in them said no-one ever."
Refreshing,"This show is a blend of the movies ""Alive"" and ""Lord of the Flies."" Greet cast and riveting plot. I was hooked after the second episode. I have up on the police/Lawyer/Medical drama shows a long time ago when nobody could get it right. HBO's ""The Wire"" came close.Watch this show, you won't regret it."
One of the top Shows ever!,"It's probably not everyone's cup of tea but I find it captivating! For me it's right up there with GOT, Squid Games and even Breaking Bad (the holy grail of TV shows) - miles better than Stranger Things or The Last of Us. The storyline is cool, 90s soundtrack is great. The characters are multidimensional and deep, unpicked layer bye layer. It's brilliantly cast and played by everyone both in the teenage set-up and as grown ups. The gore fits the story and doesn't feel forced in just for the shock factor. The humour is brilliant, sarcastic and witty. The show is probably underrated for what it is. But l can see how people would either love it or hate it. I love it 10/10."
Great overall but a weak finale and one huge glaring problem..,"...nobody changed psychically from being stuck in the woods for almost a year! No one got skinnier, hair and beards didn't grow longer. It just felt like a really huge thing to not include in a show about people trying to survive in the wilderness."
I absolutely love this show,"Yellowjackets may be a little disturbing for younger people. There's a few scenes that are a little bit gruesome. It's about a girl's soccer team, their coach, and his sons that are going to nationals when their plane crashes. They land in the middle of nowhere, and the show focuses on their survival and goes back and forth between the teens in the wilderness, and the adults years after they get out of there. It hardly ever has a filler episode, and every episode holds your attention. I love it, and I find it so interesting. I highly recommend this show to anyone who likes high action and survival stories."
It's actually good,"Makes you feel like you're watching a real story, forget the bad reviews im writing this after the first half of season1 and its great. Hope the second half will be better too."
Should be rated higher,I don't write alot of reviews and generally never before the series is complete but I felt like this show is not getting its justice in the reviews. Sure this show may not be for everyone and it's a bit dark and has sexual content. You should be aware of that before you start the show and not give it bad reviews just because that's not your thing. Anyways this is one of the best new shows I've seen in awhile. Draws you in from the beggining and has been getting better with every episode.
Starting to peter out,"There are lots of good things about Yellowjackets, in particular the cast is very strong. However it's starting to fall into the trap of drawing everything out, never resolving anything and setting itself up for the next season.Let's be honest some of it is very contrived and in some ways manipulative of the viewer. We never see what was going on at home after the crash, nor what efforts were put in to find them. I mean they did actually have air traffic control and radar then...It must have been traumatic for those left behind but we see nothing of this..We also see the teens in pretty good shape even though they're stuck in the wilderness without presumably fruit or vegetables or much sunlight...scurvy or rickets anyone?It feels there's a lot of borrowed ideas from other shows and films too. I can't help feeling the Wilderness is heavily influenced by Twin Peaks. It also feels like the writers don't really know how to end this or what it's really going to mean. If in doubt add another subplot to pad things out a bit to eke out some more episodes."
Do not watch if you care about logic.,"Made an account for this review because I feel like this show has so much promise, but the total lack of logic in the characters is nearly unbearable. Finished season 1 and I will most likely give it a chance in season 2 because the loose ends have potential. The choices these girls make are absolutely idiotic. The shrooms causing them to have an orgy and nearly kill Travis was stupidly absurd. And then later they basically blame it on Jackie and cause her to die. Jackie can't even think to maybe cover up the lighter so the wind doesn't keep it from working ? The whole situation with the plane crash and the abandoned plane were pretty crazy and couldn't be more improbable. Everyone's just total fine with lottie literally being a witch that worships satan and they all like love her for it . A bear comes up to her and basically sacrifices himself, and she's able to kill the bear instantly with a single stab wound behind its ear like what ? I get some of it can be written up to being a dumb teenager , but you can't have it both ways . They need to make some changes to how a lot of this stuff takes place in the coming season or this show will lose popularity quickly in my opinion."
"A magnificent, great, incredible series","I PROMISE YOU THAT THIS SHOW WON'T LET YOU DOWN FOR A SINGLE SECOND. The pilot is great, and as the episodes go by, it only gets more mysterious in a way it has me hooked. For the record, I've watched a lot of series, and I can confindently say that no other show has managed to make me this invested. THIS SHOW DESERVES WAY MORE RECOGNITION SO PLEASE WATCH IT. I love everything about this show and I already need a season two."
This Show Rocks,Thought it'd be like a little teener bopper show but it is serious af. So glad I decided to watch this! I really don't have any other word for it but AWESOME!
Enthralling,"Nothing less than enthralling, with a sprawling first season that expertly switches from past to present, ""Yellowjackets"" combines teenage angst with adult drama to make a show that explores trauma, grief, regret, and just how far one will go to survive, even after surviving some of the most harrowing scenarios imaginable.As a sucker for coming of age and high school movies, ""Yellowjackets"" resonated with me immediately; episode one opens showing the relationship and comradery with a group of high school girl soccer players - they train together, conspire against one another, get drunk and argue with each other, and then make up, earn each other's trust once again, and potentially break said trust almost immediately afterward. There's a metric ton of drama going on (where was all this during my high school experience?) that perfectly sets the stage for what is to come during the inevitable tragedy that occurs. However, before the girls find themselves stranded in the wilderness, the show also introduces the survivors of the crash who are alive and well in 2022. And if you thought that these girls had drama way back in the 90s, then you're going to be really impressed by how intense things can get in the present day.While any other show would choose to focus wholly on one timeline and one series of events, the genius of ""Yellowjackets"" is in its chronology; unafraid to jump between timelines without warning, what could be annoying and confusing ends up elevating the experience due to the showcase of two timelines that build upon each other through levels and levels of drama. ""Yellowjackets"" is a slow burn, one that isn't ashamed to take its time setting up its pieces, both in the past and present - and with every piece set up, I couldn't help but want to keep watching to see when exactly they would knock it back down.Stars the likes of Melanie Lynskey, Tawny Cypress, Juliette Lewis, Christina Ricci will most likely draw a lot of viewers in, and that is well warranted because the four of them - along with every single other actor and actress - is phenomenal in their role. Seriously, I can't remember the last time I've seen acting this excellent. While it would take too long to give a shout out to everyone, as everyone plays their role to perfection, I do want to say that Sophie Thatcher and Peter Gadiot were standouts; both of them played polar opposite characters, but I couldn't take my eyes off of them when they were on screen, and not only because they're both supremely attractive. Their performances had a certain magnetism to them - at times you won't know what they're up to, or whether they are trustworthy or deceitful, but you won't be able to stop watching to find out.I could go on and on, but there's no point because the crux of my review boils down to these two words: Watch ""Yellowjackets."" My only real complaint is that everything isn't necessarily tied up in a nice bow by the end, but if season two can match the quality of season one, then I'd say we're in safe hands. And even if season two completely sucks, I know for a fact that season one is going to be something that I rewatch, and rewatch often."
Finally-a Lost clone done right!,"My first reaction to reading this show's premise was ""Great, another Lost close."" After watching the pilot, my reaction was ""Hell yeah-there's finally a good Lost clone!"" This show has managed to capture all the best elements of Lost but with a better balance between past and present. Unlike the ever-growing list of other Lost clones (e.g., Terra Nova, I-LAND), Yellowjackets has the cast and story to back it up.The comparisons to Lost are many-a plane crash in a mysterious place, weird people with weird secrets, a continuous story arc told in two timelines, mysterious/spooky things lurking in the dark, etc. However, Yellowjackets manages to stand on its own with a great cast and intriguing story.This show has a lot of potential-I'm hopeful they can even one-up Lost by sticking the eventual landing."
bit off more than they can chew,"I was very intrigued to watch this show, to see how it differs from the wilds. I kind of wish it was a high school based show like riverdale, as the characters lives in that sense would have been really cool to see. I enjoyed the clever foreshadowing, and how dark it was. I'm used to films like the hunger games, where the violence is fully shown, but this show goes all in. I fell in love with jackie taylor, and there's a character for everyone as there's so many different personalities.Honestly, after jackie's death, i got a little bored. At times, the show is painfully slow (shauna and jeff panicking about dead body.) Although there is another season coming out, I can already sense there's going to be so many unanswered questions, and the audience will just have to make assumptions. It's like they don't know where the main focus should be at times."
Good show,"This show is really good! I was worried that this show would fall flat and end up being more drama heavy like pretty little liars or just not substantial enough to justify its runtime. I am glad I watched it, it is absolutely one of my favorite shows.My primary interest in this show comes from the horror. This show is surprisingly brutal. This show incorporates teen and domestic drama elements without those obstructing the horror aspects of the show. If anything, I feel as though the steady strain on the characters' bonds adds to the tension. This show has bite. Its approach to horror is unique. There are multiple threats and it isn't always clear what force is causing the peril. Sometimes the victims of the threats are the very perpetrators. I also appreciate how paranormal and spiritual elements are introduced without trying to manipulate the audience's beliefs (for instance, the show 'Evil'). Combined with the degradation of the characters' mental state and desperation to find hope it feels like a realistic depiction of how someone might fall into such thinking in a time of weakness or need.I appreciate how this show handles trauma as well. As adults, the trauma manifests in a variety of ways, some more obvious than others. I am glad that it does not make the survivors into one dimensional portrayals of victimhood because of what they suffered. When mismanaged, their symptoms are shown not only to be self destructive, but destructive to their relationships and other people around them. It shows the uglier side of trauma that a lot of media fails to address, that trauma is not contained to the victim and how they treat others. Their worse symptoms like obsessive behavior, escapism, dissociation, and at points violent tendancies paint a more realistic picture of the complex nature of deep seeded wounds and healing. This show neither excuses these behaviors nor blames the characters for what they have suffered. They allow all of the characters to be morally grey, up for the audience to decide whether or not they root for them. To me this helps with the immersive experience. You feel like you get to know the characters. Even with characters you personally dislike, you are intruiged to see what they do next. At its core I feel like this shows very different characters in terms of how they view the world and what they value, what experiences made them the way they are, and how different people have different approaches to the same problem because of their values and their past. As opposed to making a lot of the characters have the same values and moralities, the characters' tendancies to be prone to certain actions are all different. I definatley feel as though this show has very well developed characters with a variety of different perspectives that really brings the show to life.On a somewhat related note, I appreciate how the gay representation is done. It does not feel like the writers thoughtlessly threw in a gay character or two just to say they did. The characters' identities are intrinsically tied to who they are and how they see the world without it becoming the entirety of their character. Something I rarely see in media that isn't made to be specifically lgbt media.Though I definately feel like the character writing is the factor that makes this show truly special, that is not the only thing this show does right. The pacing keeps your interest. Though the overarching plot is a slow burn, each episode sees smaller arcs that only span those episodes, so even when the main plot is not being actively developed there is still enough action to keep your attention, and it is all purposeful and does not feel like filler, which i find unusual for horror tv series.Finally, I must discuss the tone of this show. I mentioned that this show is brutal and also has a significant focus on trauma. Despite this, the show is able to be a fun watch. It is not too heavy and even in the more serious moments it does not feel like a slog. There is enough comedy and some lighter drama to keep things from being too dark, but they also do not feel like forced comic relief. It flows well. The atmosphere created is a building tension without it feeling like an anxiety attack. You can be engrossed in the high stakes and dark subject matter without sacrificing your own fundamental enjoyment.All in all, great show. I generally do not call things 'masterpieces' because I feel as though it has been overused to the point of corniness. But to me, my overall consensus of the show is that it is, to me, a masterpiece. Not in a pretentious way, one of the good points of the show is its accessibility and watchability. Also rare in horror media in general. In conclusion, this show has good drama, comedy, horror, something for (almost) everybody! If you are thinking of giving it a watch I cannot reccomend it enough!"
Downhill after episode two,The firsts two episodes are some of the best tv out there. After that this show just becomes terrible. Deep dives in characters you don't care about. Just horrible writing left and right. It's pretty clear the showrumner had a great idea and either them or their writers couldn't keep it going.
Amazing,"What an amazing portray of what it would be like to survive. This show captures the view of teenagers having to survive a plane crash in the links they have to go to to do so what a masterful concept. All of the actors are amazing and really got it. I couldn't stop watching this show, due to every episode, leaving you with a cliffhanger and wanting you to kind of guess and binge the next episode. I totally recommend this series and hoping for a season two because they do leave you with a cliffhanger at the end very haunting and mysterious, this is also very gruesome series, and not for the faint of heart ."
"Wait, what?!","This review is based on the 2 episodes that are out now.Episode 1 was ok, built up some tension, but holly crap! What happened with episode 2??!!!!So, you telling me that possibly/probably people got stranded in Canadian wilderness for almost 2 years coz Ugly Betty didn't want to go back being a nobody and smashed the black box/transponder, so she can continue to be relevant and the center of attention in all the madness that ensued?! Oh and she's doing the same crap in 2021, sabotaging Nat's car, so they can ride together to the cabin.Are you kidding me?! Is that the ""smart"" script writers came up with?! WOW! That's gotta be the fastest 'jump the shark' in the history of recent TV.Next episode Ugly Betty will defeat Sasquatch with a spoon and be crowned Queen of the Jungle!Get me outta here ASAP! I'm done!"
Leaves you with only questions... Never answers.,"The first season had me hooked and felt like it was leading to something. The season finale came and went with questions on where we were headed. I felt those questions would start to be answered in the second season, so I patiently awaited season two's arrival.Now.... 4 episodes into season 2, I feel as though the show is only giving rise to more and more questions and never giving answers.I understand we're in the age where people like to consume their information on more than one screen and source. But I shouldn't have to head to message boards and Reddit to try and find speculative answers.The writers give tidbits of info that only lead to 5x's more questions!I'm done watching for now.Someone please let me know if we ever start to find out what's going on."
Not Great yet...,"Could become a great TV show but after one episode can't call it. I've watched many TV shows with a good premise and an awkward start. This is one of them, like Breaking Bad wasn't great early neither was The Leftovers- but they're amongst my favourite shows. Slow start, but could build to something special hopefully."
So much potential.. but dangerous non-linear writing,"First two episodes are great, if not really ambitious. It seems like to get where they are as adults we are going to have to have a LOT more story around the crash and following survival acts. Those scenes are few right now, so we have to take a lot of liberties in what we think happened. Therefore this could be really great, or it could turn into a botched up wasted opportunity like The Stand. So far it has me hooked, the scripting is very well done, and the characters are great."
Great so far!,"I really enjoy the show so far! The acting is great and live the mystery, psychological aspect of it! I just hope that Jackie is still alive in present day, I think that would be interesting!"
Really good,"First of all, Thank you Juliette Lewis for not becoming a face-lifted Hollywood freak. You allowed your real freakiness to age organically. That gets major stars from me. This a powerful story about a sports team who crashed and are now abandoned. Haven't finished, duh, but wow this is a must see. Amazing music and script."
Total rubbish,I was skeptical of this show to begin with given the advertised plot but some positive comments about it prompted me to give it a shot. After suffering through three episodes the prospect of slogging through another seven was just too much. Poor acting combined with a script that was just plain silly made this one unwatchable.
First time review... I think :-),"I'm pretty sure, that this is the first time i write a review. Even if i have this account for 20 + years and i'm a german speaking guy (so sorry for the faults).I think that this is a show that don't insult the intelligence of the viewers. Also on an emotional level. I read a lot of comments here, that the show is too slow, there is nothing happening... But for myself i have to say, that makes me so much more investet for thee individual charakters. I'm totally into it. For sure, you got not a lot of action (in fact, there are no superheroes involved but actual humans) and that makes it for me even more gripping. It could need a little more speed, a little more tense. But, as i wrote, for the built of the characters, i think they could not have done it more tense. The setting of the past/present also confised me at the beginning but also intrigued me a lot. So for the first season i must say, bravo! So well done! I'm with the people in the forrest (and also later in the present) and i can feel they're emotions. I understand they're thinking. The only thing that this show makes not a perfect 10 for me is - i agree - only the pace. I'm waiting for the second season now (even the first is not over yet). I know the characters, i feel with em and i also wish that there will be a new ""starting point"". And i have the hope, that in the second season, there will be even more tense, threats and suspense. Because now i care. Very well done. Now get on the pedal and shock us even more with what will come. Even if we know, which character will survive and which not, this show always managed me to be invested and even shocked sometimes. Looking forward and can't wait!"
Intriguing opening episode has me wanting more of this,"As ""Yellowjackets"" (2021 release; 10 episodes of about 55 min each) opens in Episode 1, a teenage girl is running for her life in a snowy forest, only to fall into a large pit. The scenery shifts to today, as we hear people talk about a plan crash that happened years ago. We then go to ""1996"", as we are introduced to a group of high school girls playing in the New Jersey state soccer championship game, which they win. At this point we are 10 min into Episode 1 but to tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: this is the latest TV series created by Ashley Lyle and Bart Nickerson, who previously created the well-received ""Narcos"" and ""Narcos: Mexico"" series. With ""Yellowjackets"" they shift gears altogether, where a group of New Jersey high school girls gets thrown into the unexpected (their plane on the way to the national championship crashes). There are hints that some very dark things happened after the crash but at this point (having seen only Episode 1 so far), we have no further clues or information. Episode 1 jumps back and forth between 1996 and 2021, and 2 of the 2021 characters are played by Juliette Lewis and Christina Ricci. The rest of the cast was unknown to me. Bottom line is that it didn't take long for me to have Episode 1 pique my interest in this series, and I'm already looking forward to seeing more episodes.""Yellowjackets"" premiered on Showtime this past Sunday, and Episode 1 is now available on SHO on Demand and other streaming platforms. New episodes air Sunday evenings at 10 pm Eastern. If you like a good mystery involving life-or-death survival, I'd readily suggest you check this out and draw your own conclusion."
Great but inconsistent,"By far I think everyone agrees that the first season is better but that doesn't make the second one bad. You can say that season 1 is a set up for season 2 but then you can also say that as soon as the third one comes out.The cinematography is amazing, it draws in the audience making them want more, the character arcs are insane, the music is fantastic and I love the title sequence/intro. Yet it can be predictable in some ways and is a but flawed. Writers did make stupid decisions the show has its own unique storyline and feels like something that I've never seen before.It is definitely worth the watch and I do recommend."
Amazing start that just pales with every episode,"I'm keeping this spoiler free. Let's get this out of the way right up front: this show has a fantastic premise and the first episode is absolutely terrific. It starts out SO strong and I was really looking forward to seeing where it went.Even though I assume it's not the case, it legitimately felt like the writers had no idea how they wanted to resolve the central mystery (what happened on the island that was so terrible?), and just kept putting it off. Most of the characters were really strong and the acting was great (Christina Ricci in particular was fantastic). But I literally let out a ""of come on"" in the final 5 minutes of the finale. It takes such a disappointing direction and doesn't resolve everything, which I assume is for the inevitable second season.If this had been a single self-contained mini-series that focused on human desperation, the lengths that we'll go to in order to survive, and going insane while being stranded in the wilderness it would have been incredible. And who knows, you may still like it. I just ended up being really disappointed with how it turned out."
"First season OK, Second season is insufferable.","The first season was watchable and somewhat interesting. 6 episodes in to season 2 and where the show is at could have been accomplished in 1 or 2 episodes. The show is stagnant and no characters are likeable or interesting. Kelly's affair/murder storyline is so overdone and uninteresting. Episode 6 will be our last. My wife who is a nurse last straw was when the baby was born. The newborns skin color was great, extremely well nourished for a mother who I malnourished. This after a complicated delivery in a freezing cabin and the bany so clean too. Also the girls clothes are clean, skin great for a group stranded in a remote frozen forest."
"Well, will need to wait for season 2",Started out strong. The very first episode is super promising and sets you up for the plot. But you literally watch the entire season for the setup of having to wait for season 2. Characters are great. Storyline is great. Will definitely be waiting for season 2!
GREAT,"Can't wait for more eps, ep 1 was so good. Can't wait to see how it all happened. Ignore bad reviews definitely watch this, lord the flies but twisted and ruthless. Interesting and great casting."
so far really enjoying it,Obviously its a new show but the acting is good and plot is interesting. Like every other show the high schoolers look as old as their older counter parts though. Im pretty over 35 year olds playing 16 year olds makes it less enjoyeable.
Captivating,"Yellowjackets drew me in very quickly. I love a show with a female focus, first off, and then one with a pack load of mysteries. I appreciate that the show is taking its time and not trying to explain everything all at once or talk down to the audience. Really makes me keep coming back.I'm not always a fan of the back and forth time line aspect shows can do, but it works well with this show. Knowing who is going to survive but then realizing you might not for sure when they introduce new adults actually brings more tension than I expected. I love the basics of survival and life in the wilderness they address with the children portions, things like how to handle a period! The acting is amazing all around, especially with the teens. Even the more secondary characters get their moments of joy or horror.I was very happy to see at least one lesbian relationship. With a high school sports team it would be silly not to have one. But the friendships and the shifting of loyalties and leadership-esque roles is just as engaging to me. I will keep watching!"
Thrilling and captivating - but could be better,"Yellowjackets is an enthralling TV series that delves into the harrowing aftermath of a plane crash, leaving a group of teenagers (mostly girls) stranded in the untamed Canadian wilderness. The narrative seamlessly alternates between the present day, where the survivors grapple with haunting memories, and the 1990s, where the girls fight for survival and battle the effects of their traumatic ordeal.This psychological thriller fearlessly explores themes of survival, identity, loyalty, betrayal, and violence. It fearlessly confronts the brutal and gruesome realities of wilderness living while delving deep into the emotional and mental toll it exacts on the characters. The show raises thought-provoking questions about the essence of humanity and the lengths individuals would go to safeguard themselves and their companions.One of the Yellowjackets' greatest strengths is its exceptional acting and well-crafted characters. The ensemble cast comprises diverse, talented performers who breathe life into complex and flawed characters with remarkable depth and subtlety. The show adeptly develops the relationships between these characters across different timelines, allowing us to witness their transformation and how their choices and actions reverberate in the present.The direction, score, cinematography, production design, special effects, editing, and pacing all contribute to the show's high quality. The series creates a palpable and immersive atmosphere that will keep you on the edge of your seat, fully engaged in the narrative. The show weaves an air of mystery and suspense using a skilful combination of flashbacks, flash-forwards, and hallucinations. Stunning visuals and carefully crafted sound effects further enhance the storytelling, effectively conveying the mood and tone of each scene.Another standout aspect of the show is its dialogue. The writing showcases witty, sharp, and authentic conversations that capture each character's distinct voice and personality. Balancing the dark and serious tone, the series cleverly employs humour, sarcasm, and irony. The incorporation of references to pop culture, music, and literature adds a layer of authenticity and relatability.While Yellowjackets offers an intriguing and captivating viewing experience for fans of psychological horror and drama, it does have room for improvement. One criticism I have is its occasionally slow-paced and protracted nature. Although the show takes its time to build the plot and develop the characters, there are instances where it feels like the story lingers without significant progress or resolution. The series also leaves several questions unanswered, which may prove frustrating for some viewers. It also occasionally relies on clichés and tropes commonly found in the genre, including jump scares, red herrings, and unreliable narrators.Yellowjackets undoubtedly stands as a thrilling and captivating TV series that caters to fans of psychological horror and drama. While it exhibits great potential and promise, there is still room for growth and refinement. It will be interesting to see the next season and how the story unfolds."
THIS IS MY NEW FAVORITE SHOW!,"I wasn't going to write a review but, after seeing all the negative reviews, I felt compelled to. This show is a slow burn thriller. You have to stick around to watch the story and characters develop. I promise, it's worth it! This show is addictive! So much going on. One review mentioned it was okay until the end. Well, ""the end"" isn't the end. It will continue with season 2. We still don't know exactly what's going on, and that's part of what makes it so great! The casting is perfect. The story and acting are outstanding. And the soundtrack is awesome!"
"Mystery, drama, horror, thriller.","For season one;
The Yellowjackets are a highschool all girl soccer team. They enter a national competition and their plane crashes in the middle of some woods on route, miles away from any of civilization.The general premise might sound familiar but the storytelling, the building of each character and a mystery person separates this story from any similar stories. All of which contributes towards the slowly unraveling of what exactly happened during the nineteen months the group were stranded and the present day when a stranger is blackmailing the victims to keep their deepest, darkest secrets from becoming public. What did happen is slowly revealed, what might have happened is hinted and what could happen is yet to be seen.Now at the end of season one, some flaws might get addressed in the next season but, as it stands now, this could have been wrapped up in ten episodes with a tight score of 10/10. Still impressive when considering the duration of each episode is fifty minutes. I also hope that this series remains unspoiled by too much situational scenarios, that which often ruins many TV shows by prolonging a good storytelling in exchange for longevity.Edit: no other seasons of Yellowjackets were viewed, since by the end of season one there were enough to infer the general gist of the story without a dramatic end, and the end of season one had concluded enough for me to be satisfied with only enjoying one season."
[6.7] Mean and thin,"What is Yellowjackets (2021-)?! A semi-interesting to direct-horrible series with talented all-around actresses, some brighter than the others (Jackie, young Shauna...), very good acting, stupid supernatural/mystical atmosphere, as much suspense in it as swans in a lake and so much jumping back and forth between past and present that you better watch it on an empty stomach.Nevertheless, it has qualities (wilderness, summer and winter depiction, magic foods!, ...), some crazy score and so much damaged characters (young and middle-aged alike) in it that it will drag you to its season 2 whether you like it or not.Welcome to its fan club!"
Yellowjackets,"Directing and acting are really great. Music and sound is good as well. I can see why people like the show but I think it's not working for me. Honestly I've been let down by this after seeing a bunch of hype about it. I just don't see it, the major fault of this show is the pacing, it's...so...slow. And not in a good contemplative way, but scenes of dialog that make you want to fall asleep. I'm sorry but none of the characters here are interesting nor do you want to care about them. The only parts that are actually interesting are the ones after the crash. Aside from that, I was expecting more horror and it's about 1% horror 99% mediocre drama. That's nothing to say about the acting though as that was good overall. Nitpick though but the so called ''ugly'' girl in this show is absolutely not ugly, but the show tries really hard and it simply does not work, all the scenes feel fake. I barely got through and decided not to waste my time. This would've been an interesting movie. As a show, it fails to keep my attention sadly."
Learning to love and grow,"The girl's soccer team learns lessons in team support and being kind to each other after experiencing an unfortunate plane accident in the Canadian wilderness. What ensues is a coming of age story about finding satisfaction and hope in difficult circumstances. The girls are the best of friends and because their bonds are so strong, they all support each other during this difficult time.Overall an uplifting story of perseverance and team support that will leave you feeling good about supporting your local soccer team."
Wait for it,"Watch the preview for episode 9 if you don't understand Adam's attraction to Shauna. I didn't used to like the two story line idea (going back and forth in time), but you have to PAY ATTENTION. It's really a great story and I love Juillette Lewis and never really liked Christina Ricci, but Misty is fascinating! Showtime is doing some really good stuff. Wakefield was amazing and the return of Dexter is so satisfying."
Strong writing + acting keeps this one going,"I'll preface by saying, this one gets its hooks in you right away with no punches pulled.It settled in nicely and now you/we get just enough of the breadcrumbs to keep a subtle amount of ambiguity and the red herring aliveWhat sets it apart, as Showtime certainly could use their first well written series (not since the first few seasons of Dexter, and maybe season one of Ray Donovan) in some time. I personally look so forward to watching this script unpacking itself--- and so far, delivering. Season 2 is off to a great start with the continuation of the Travis sub-storyline, and the shift to the cult situation and backstory that is developing slowly while leaving an impression that all may not be as the viewer is led to believe without the lazy and insulting bait and switch.Delivers on every level."
One of the best shows I've ever seen,I have watched A LOT of shows. And I can honestly say this is one of the best series I've ever watched. I was hooked immediately from the first episode and now on episode 8 I am still just as enthralled as I was at the beginning. All the reviews saying otherwise obviously havnt watched through. It's not even completed and I NEED a second season.
Season 2 was a mess,"I started watching because of the good reviews and I was pleased because season one was incredible. Acting, writing, script, everything was perfect. I loved the mixture of genres from coming of age to horror but there was a HUGE downfall from that for season 2. The writing makes no sense and the ending was very disappointing. Natalie's dead is so stupid and the characters grow absolutely nothing from season one. We don't know anything about Taissa's dark past and Van's cancer appeared out of nowhere. If it gets renewed they really need to go back to that good writing they had on the first installment."
Keeps you hooked,I will echo with another reviewer said here.. it keeps stringing you long.. it's definitely interesting and you keep watching to see what happens next..but there are a lot of major plot points that have been dropped here and there without a lot of details about where those bits are taking you as the viewer..I will say the haunting background music/vocal chants etc. Are really unique to this series and set a great atmosphere..I'll be looking forward to Season 2..
It could have been so good,"I loved the first half of season 1, I mean I hated their older counter parts but I loved their characters as teenagers. I thought the survival was super interesting and that is was based in the 90s. All of the main girls were for the most part likeable. When it shows their older selves non of them acted how they did when they were young. I hated all of them. I didn't care about her husband cheating on her or Nats drug habits or Tais political campaign. Not what I was watching the show for. Then the magical cult aspect came in to play about the last 3 episodes and it just got sillier and sillier. I no longer cared if any of the girls survived. They all sucked anyways and they suck as adults. I wish they had only had the girls as teenagers. Non of the adult boring stuff. And if they were gonna make one of the girls into a cult leader I wish it wasn't because of the magical forest. And why did Jackie just freeze to death outside, such a lame end. So disappointing, I was so excited when I watched the first episode."
"The music alone, pulled me in - then the storyline & acting hooked me!","Christina Ricci & Juliette Lewis - do I need to say anything else? They are, as always, absolutely phenomenal actresses and are nothing short of captivating in this show. Next is the music, which is the soundtrack to my high school and college years. Then there's the storyline, which sucked me in from the first episode. It's a great combination of suspense, drama and intrigue, and at the end of each episode I'm wondering how an hour went by so quickly, and I'm already anticipating the next episode. It's a great show and I'm hoping there's going to be a second season. Lastly, I would be remiss if I didn't mention that the young actresses hold their own against the seasoned actresses and they do a fantastic job emulating the adults version of the characters they're playing. Everything about this show is awesome. So much so, that I've been recommending it to everyone who will listen. This show is a definite must watch."
Strong opening but then tapered off.,"(Reviewed after the end of season one).Enjoyed this but it did not live up to the writing and promise of the first couple of episodes. The opening had well written characters and scenes but as the season went on things became a bit silly, less believable and more muddled.As a whole it felt drawn out to the point that at the end of ten episodes we have not got to the flash forward we see in the opening episode. To me this was disappointing and from the middle of the season the whole things dragged, it didn't really have much of an ending either.I would watch a second season but I hope it has more of a story arc or at least a better pace than how things are at this point."
Great start....and then.,I had to update my review. Initially it started great. Loved the nostalgia and the soundtrack. Then it just got weirder and weirder. It's honestly like the series lost meets the movie Alive but in the Canadian mountains. Characters that were not on the plane all of a sudden appear like the audience isn't going to notice. Maybe it's intentional but it's not like they did any introduction. I just feel like the second season is just too far out. I feel like there is a lot of filler episodes.
WOW,"This show had me more tense, episode to episode, than anything I've seen in a while. Creepy, fun, haunting, traumatic and mysterious. I think Showtime has something great on their hands with this and hope it consistently gets better with each season. The soundtrack is awesome and the cast is all stellar!"
Underrated,Such a fantastic show from the very first episode. Only half way through the first season but OMG it is highly bingeable (if that is a word).Two thumbs up and 10 stars!!
Something new,I like the new and innovative idea. It started of a bit silly but after the second episode it all came together. I love the anticipation of what happens next. The fact that you cant figure out the whole plot within seconds keeps you binge watching. Hope they wont drag out the ending for 16 seasons. We already had our share of Lost.
Great series,I hope the show casts someone like Sydney Penny as the older Lottie Matthews. Decent actress and she looks just like her.Binge watched the first season in under a week. Best show I've seen since Westworld.
Good but not great..,"Wondering why people leave 'reviews' when the season isn't complete?Would you bother leaving a review 20 minutes into a movie, I assume these people do?Sadly leaving a 10 assuming the entire season will be like the first episode, these are the same people demanding a second season after that same episode!!"
Pleasantly Surprised,"This show has been a wonderful find. It gives off HBO's The Leftovers vibes which is exactly the kind of content I eat up.I honestly wish I discovered this show at the end if it's run because now I have to wait for it to come back. That said, I'm looking forward towards future consumption."
Watchable but not great,"Why did they have to go into an exorcism and possession? The character development could have been enough, the story could have been enough but once you start introducing spirits and demonic possessions, as they did in the latest episode, it becomes a turn off. Though, i will watch to the end as you simply have invested so much time into it by then."
Wow.. It's been a while.,"Incredible show. The soundtrack, actor lineup, story telling, everything..is so damn good. It has been a long time since since a show got me so hooked. It has laughs, suspense, drama, mystery, and some of the most graphic scenes I've ever seen in a show. It's been said before in many reviews but it really does feel like the female version of lord of the flies in some ways. Don't miss this one. Eagerly awaiting season 2!"
Very GOOD show,"I loved season 1 . I liked how the show plays both from the perspective of them as kids experiencing the trauma / showing them when they're all grown up . I think this is pretty unique and haven't really seen other shows do it like this .I think what really stood out to me in this series is the eeriness that was portrayed throughout the show . It definitely has a horror element to the show and you can't quite put your finger on it and I love it . Even when you get to the end , much is revealed, but you still don't quite know what to make of it . I am expecting for lots of questions to be answered in season 2 .Definitely a plus for Yellowjacket's . It's very addictive and have been waiting for over a year for the new season to air this month ! Season 2 can't get here soon enough !"
First season it's just the beginning,Starts amazingly. Then sometimes it may get a little slow. But every episode has its jaw-opener. The end it's painful and raw. I'm a fan. Let the theories begin.
The 10s and 9s are not reaI,"So disappointed watching this utter tripe.Really disgusted.Also the music choices are wrong and several songs outdated by 1996.The present day actresses young counterparts LOOK nothing like them.Totally different looking faces/eye/hair color/ AND personalities.Just a nasty and depressive show.Could have been good as a black dark comedy, but isntead just depressing."
a well done survival drama,"A wildly talented high school girls' soccer team becomes the (un)lucky survivors of a plane crash deep in the Canadian wilderness.From beginning to end I was completely enthralled by Showtimes survival drama, Yellowjackets. For the 90s flashbacks, it's clear that the series draws heavy inspiration from William Golding's classic, ""Lord of the Flies"", but with a modern feminine twist to it. While the present is a masterful character study on survivors' guilt and the midlife crisis. Both of these stories perfectly balance and complement one another. The writing is witty and each character is given an insane amount of depth and characterization. Yellowjackets also hold no punches back when it comes to the series gore. The series opens up with one of the girls being hunted and bled like a pig to be prepared for a cannibalistic feast. Talk about a messed-up opening.With the series' enthralling storying, you must also have some fantastic acting involved as well, in this case, some Emmy-nominated acting. Melanie Lynskey proves yet again that she is one of the most underrated actresses in Hollywood with her captivating performance. She masterfully portrays women having a mid-life crisis, but with some horrifying undertones. She definitely earned her Emmy nomination. Her younger counterpart, played by Sophie Nelisse also does a fantastic job. Nelisse's acting never tries to impersonate Lynskey, but you can clearly tell they are the same person. Ella Purnell and Juliette Lewis are also two big standouts in the series. My favorite performance easily has to be from Christina Ricci. She earned her Emmy nomination by playing someone who is harmless at first but is a sociopath under her unsettling smile. Overall, this series does a fantastic job with its acting.The series is hauntingly beautiful. They masterfully create an unsettling atmosphere with their camera work. Furthermore, the series uses atmospheric female whispers for the score further adds to the series' unsettling nature. With half of this series taking place in the mid-90s, it has a great soundtrack filled with female rockers of the 90s. My only real problem with this series is that some of the VFX look really rough at points. Secondly, some of the survival decisions and situations they make are unrealistic. For example, one character gets mauled by a wolf in the flashback and she comes out relatively unscathed. Obviously, she is deformed but there is no infection or anything like that present. Given how it also takes her over 24 hours to get some form of medical attention, I am surprised that no infection had begun. Other than that, I greatly enjoyed this series, and it's definitely the most underrated of this year's Emmy nominations. I highly recommend it to all. (First two episodes are free on YouTube).I am giving Yellowjackets (Season 1), an A-."
Intriguing Thriller with amazing Performances,"One of the best mystery thrillers on tv. Story is intriguing and the performances are amazing. So good to see Melanie lynskey getting her well desesrved leading lady recognition. Been waiting for this type of content. A must watch if you love gore, mystery and great performances."
Get on this crazy train!,What I love most about this show is also what drives me crazy. In real time we're watching everyone trying to get out from under the blackmail and left wondering what on earth they did so horrible to be blackmailed for. In the flashbacks we see their time in the wilderness progress and unfold into what I'm assuming is some horrible event or events. Two unfolding plots at once that are hopefully going to collide in the next two episodes!
"Started like Lost Season 1, ended like Lost Season 6","Started of so well, there was mystery, suspense, drama, romance, friendship. And then in 2022, it just turned into a teenage drama. The storyline completely changed to idiotic things. Just a waste of what could have been a great series."
CAPTIVATING!,Gotta check out the Reddit page for this show. Absolutely insane. Been years since there was a community like this built around the show and it's only destined to grow. Phenomenal writing and even better acting.
Lord of the Flies meets Lost meets Fear Street,It is original in its merging of genres. It is intriguing and presents a lot of promise. I think many people on seeing the subject matter and watching the trailer will want to watch this and want it to be good. Ultimately though you complete the season and realise it never really amounted to much. Not a lot really happens at the end of the day. Difficult to turn off but ultimately not that great. Not a complete waste of time but I think most will be rather disappointed because it looks like it has so much promise but never really delivers.
Finally a crack in its facade,"I was surprised that not only did Jeff think it was a good idea while under surveillance to call and tell about the police finding the body. Even stupider than that was that not only was the cop that had just been accused of stagitory rape on the raid on the raid of the house of his accuser BUT... was also left alone with the under age accuser in her room.. they really thought about that one. Can't help but wonder how much of that intricate writing has to do with the writes strike. 🤔 😆
It's an excellent show definitely worth the watch and maybe even watch twice I always realize new and understand deeper on the 2nd go around."
Ridiculous.,"This show is loaded with plot holes, totally unrealistic, and sometimes flat out illogical. I'm only watching it because of my family and friends.First of all, there is no way a plane load full of a high school female soccer team would go down, and nobody would come looking for them. Even though the one girl destroyed the black box, they had radar back in the 80s and 90s. They could track on radar where the plane went down. That would give them a starting point. But it's been months and we haven't seen one search party, plane or helicopter. These girls are building fires with smoke rising. They would have been rescued within one week. And what about all the parents? They just said, ""Oh well, our daughter's plane went down. I hope she's okay. What's for dinner?"" They would have been pressuring the authorities to keep looking.And wolves are not going to attack a group of 5 teenagers sitting around a campfire. They may circle the camp site trying to steal food. But they won't just dive in and attack. How many cowboys and pioneers slept around a campfire in groups as small as one and two people. No wolves were attacking them.And why was the stream or river red with blood?I have forgotten more plot holes than I can remember. I just stopped keeping track. It's just too ridiculous.But I've always loved Melanie Lynskey in everything I've seen her in. And who doesn't like Christina Ricci?I don't know what has been more fun. Pointing out all the plot holes, laughing about it being so unrealistic and illogical. Or trying to follow the ridiculous plot.My rating is for entertainment. Not for all the plot holes, unrealism or illogic. Now they are getting into the supernatural. Oh my goodness . . . Geez."
Truly preposterous with unlikable characters.,"Binged this in a few days at the insistence of my girlfriend as we weathered out a storm. Honestly would have preferred to be stranded in the wilderness, as far away from a TV set and this absolute disaster of a show as humanely possible.Where to begin? I don't know - I want to complain about every single choice / whether it be a horribly written line of dialogue, terribly framed shot, uninspired acting choice - you name it, it sucked.No mystery, no suspense, not a single character to root for or even remotely care about, and worst of all, toward the end of the season, the main characters end up committing a crime so heinous any shred of likability is completely gone and they all just become psychotic, horrible people.Not only that - it truly feels episode to episode is written by different writers who are not consulting with each other as to where the story is even going. Perfect example - at the end of a later episode a character dies in a terrible explosion, thirty minutes into the next episode not a single character has even mentioned this and no one seems to care.Melanie Lynsky is totally unbelievable as the housewife having a steamy, sexy affair. It's honestly embarrassing and makes you uncomfortable. Even the way she kisses is tight and awkward and there is zero chemistry. Juliette lewis is overacting so hard you can almost see her constantly thinking of ways to unnaturally contort her body and face and to be more tic filled. A grating performance to say the least. The teen actors are honestly all terrible. Not a single line of dialogue uttered by any of them feels real or has a shred of the stakes at hand. Especially the Travis actor - what a wet blanket. And for some reason all the ladies wanna sleep with him?The only redeeming quality of this show is Ricci - and even then - I have no idea what the hell her character is even doing.I can't wait for them all to just go ahead and eat each other. It will end the insufferable, inane dialogue you have to attempt to stay awake through.It is a travesty that this gets another season and countless others never even see the light of day."
fantastic pilot episode,"The show has solid cinematography, acting and so far writing. The opening had me hooked but it would take nearly the entire episode to fully wrap back around to a similar scene.Melanie Lynskey is great, as always, the music is well placed my only issue was the amount of sex in the first episode alone, I'm not prude but a few of the instances were highly gratuitous, with only one possibly being plot related.The dynamic between the younger cast is solid, and there were many tense moments in the episode, while the plot unfolded naturally.I will definitely be checking out the next episode to see if it can continue to remain this quality, if so then it's gonna be a good season :)if you're debating checking it out, I recommend you do, I also didn't think this held interest to me but it surprised me in a great way!"
Unanswered questions,Got to the last episode and had more unanswered questions than answered. How'd they get back? What happened with the pregnancy? What's going on with Travis?!
Love it,Its a bit of a slow burn but it picks up steam. Sit back and enjoy. Its excellent! Not sure why all the hate. Hoping there is another season. Really like the mystery element.
Don't miss this one,"A highly engaging and enjoyable series, each episode gets better than the last as you learn more about the characters.I found this show by accident, so glad I did as every episode is so good.Don't miss this one...."
Left with no answers!,"Season 1 on the whole was good, the first few episodes were great but the next few were very boring and I nearly didn't bother finishing, it however did pick up and the last few episodes were great, however the finale was incredibly disappointing leaving you with absolute no answers! I understand the need to have a cliff hanger to tie you into watching next season but this was infuriating, no answers, no idea where the show is going, doubt I'll bother with next season."
"Epic nostalgia, brilliant cast and wicked story!","Brilliant writing, acting, directing and the soundtrack is perfection. This show had me hooked from the first few minutes until the last episode. Point deducted for the gross animal stuff but that's only because I get bummed out by it not because it doesn't marry with the plot!"
Finally a unique story not done before.,"I hadn't heard anything about the show before I watched it because it comes on after Dexter True Blood. Immediately I was hooked after episode 1. The season was a slow burn but still had the ability to keep you interested. Episode 9 was the best & gave the most answers to season-long mysteries but the the finale (Episode 10) was the worst. So underwhelmed with the finale. I felt no emotions from a character death in the finale because of the manner in which the death occurred & the less talented youngsters of the cast reactions to the death (a couple of the young ones are really talented tho)
Juliette Lewis is NEXT level talent! She had a scene in a motel room and.....wow, just wow!!Christina Ricci is another top talent & her hilarious yet creepy twisted character is the craziest but the most fun to watch.The finale to me was my one gripe with this show! I love it but did not care for the finale. It was predictable, underwhelming and at most maybe answered 2 out of many WTF mysteries of the show & for such a slow burn of a season, that kinda soured it for me in a way. The cliffhanger was so mild & half of it I had already predicted but overall the finale lacked any shock or satisfying answers to really be excited about Season 2 or about having to wait for a year for another season. I don't think that is a great way to maintain momentum in between long waits in between seasons for a show that only gives us 10 episodes that finishes a season with way more unanswered questions than it gives us excitement to eagerly await another season.Other than the last episode, I really enjoyed this show. The throwback music, the excellent adult cast and their younger selves and how trauma can lead to complete lunacy that tows the line between where the mind goes vs supernatural elements but never actually crosses the line to supernatural, very well done storytelling, aside from the absurd finale.If I had known, I would of waited until the series ended so I could binge watch the series because I had more excitement from week to week between episodes than I have now, after that finale for season 2."
Interesting enough to keep going,"This show had an intriguing concept but I find there's too much going on at times making it hard to follow or believable. It's rated too high imo, I'd give it a 7 just based on it being fairly unique. That being said I did like it overall and it's certainly worth the watch if you like the premise."
Starts off really well. Doesn't come close to potential.,"The show starts off with a gripping scene and continues for most of the first season. As season 2 rolls in, suspense begins to wane.... Around episode 5 I'm questioning why I'm still watching.Episode 7 has just killed it for me. No idea why any producer would take such a great concept and make it this ridiculous.As Misty, easily one of the best characters in the show, begins her journey in the sensory deprivation tank, the evidence is shown that the writers have given up and are now just churning out content.It feels like a mix of Lost and Walking Dead. Starts out great, burns out into a directionless annoyance."
"Inventine, original and consitently engaging","I watch a lot of drama's and I have been so surprised by how much I have enjoyed this on so many levels. It's totally original, I am surprised at every turn and it is full of different emotions. It is so well executed.I love Drama's with multiple plots running through them, rather than slow/slice of life/ single character led drama's and so this really delivers. There are so many characters, and each is going through something different, and I found myself thinking about every episode between viewings, which for me is a sign that it's really grabbed my attention.I agree with reviews that it isn't hugely scary, but I don't at all think that's a problem, for me it's a perk. It's incredibly tense, and at times scary, but it's not a cliche horror movie. Its very clever with the fear and emotional whirlwind it takes you on. I also agree with the reviews that say it gets better. There's a feeling in ep 1 that it may go down too much of a cheesy high-school route, but there is so much coming beyond that. There is only 1 plot flaw in series 2 that I felt was weak. Beyond that I'm amazed at how much solid writing and characterisation they pack into every episode and the casting is brilliant. Loved it!"
Psyc or Supernatural? (SPOILERS),"There are many unanswered questions which I can only assume will be answered in the next season. There were indications that the behaviour was psychological but also strong hints at something supernatural. It is deliberately ambiguous. For example, lootie is prophecising many things that end up becoming true however it appears she is also off her meds. Are these predictions simply coincidences and she is just psychotic? Her remarks about it 'being inside of you'; are they the ramblings of a teenager experiencing trauma? We know trauma does strange things to the mind. The only example of 'it being inside you' is when the girls try to kill Travis. However, they were on shrooms in what remains a high stress environment and all it takes is one crazy person (ie lootie) to start of an episode of mass psychosis. This is not unheard of. People are susceptible to any ideas when on shrooms and have done things that they wouldn't dream of doing while sober. Lootie was speaking in French with a strange voice however it is stated that she takes French in school. It was then told that she was bad at French, however as a French speaker she was not exactly speaking long complex sentences.Bottomline: young minds in a high stress environment can lead to a shared experience of trauma that can manifest in different ways. I believe that mass psychosis is a manifestation of this and thr supernatural elements are a red herring.Also, why did nobody come when the plane went down? The black boxes last known location was exactly where the crash was as we know it was destroyed after the crash by one of the characters."
Not what I expected at all but ended up LOVING it!,I had watched the trailer to this show a few times and it seemed decent and I ended up forgetting about it and I had started watching Mayor Of Kingstown through Amazon Prime and when I finished that shows first season this was another recommendation from Prime. So I re-watched the trailer and decided to give the show a shot and I am so glad that I did! I was so bummed when I realized I had finished the season and now have to wait for the newest one to come out. I think I have re-watched this show at least 3 times so far.
Strong start but limps across the goal line,"One of the strongest pilots I've ever watched, truly, but by the end you just want it to be over. Too many weird twists with no payoff and the last episode is more of a yawn than a hook to come back for season 2. Strong performances all around but just too weird and all over the place to stay engaged."
Only partly what you think it!,"Much like the plane in the movie, wherever you think this show is going to take you, it won't. The acting and pacing are phenomenal. The setting draws you in as much as the dialogue and suspense. Oh and the best part, I found a new actress to crush on.... Christina Ricci. All the main characters do a great job but Ms. Ricci's role stole the show for me. I've always thought she was gorgeous, and now she's expanded her range as far as my experience with her goes.Too many required characters for these reviews so this section is just to burn up the raining digits.... 30 more to go, 15 more and....done."
Interesting show that eats itself live,"The show starts off terrifically, with an horrific plane crash and an increasing sense of desperation among the survivors. It feels like what the best of tv can offer: a character-driven show, and the characters who are presented to the viewers feel real, convincing, and are beautifully portrayed. But as the series progresses it starts to rely on plot, and slowly the characters melt away into mechanical devices to let the plot unfold. Also, the show begins to become way too tedious, overwrought, even, by the last episode, silly. Maybe the second season will return the series back to a character driven drama, but given the almost ridiculous ending, it might be too late to save this show.One other note: the actresses playing the young girls are much better than the veterans playing the girls as adults. Maybe the younger roles are easier but wow, the young cast makes the veteran cast look like newbies on the scene. Especially poor is Christina Ricci and the usually very reliable Juliette Lewis, whose performance is like something out of Grand Guignol. There's a reason that style is no longer in fashion. It's way too over the top."
Addicting,"I'm on episode three and so far I like it very much. One of my favorite things about it is it gives a large group of some of our best actresses, who have spent their entire work lives competing with each other for the same slim supply of roles, a chance to work together and create a terrific ensemble team. The storyline can get a bit convoluted at times, but that's what the rewind button is for."
Don't bother,Only a few episodes in and I'm ready to give up. The only good acting is done by Melanie Lynskey and Sophie Nellisse. It's also the only casting that makes sense. Think of it as a Euphoria/True Detective/Lord of the Flies mashup. Waste of time.
"Good idea, bad acting and bad plot","Honestly I think the idea is very good and if actual good directors and actors were involved in the development of this show, I believe something big would've came out of it. It is very sad to see so many good reviews and that it actually ends up extended to more seasons. I do recommend however that you wait before actually rating the show until you at least get into the second season. The acting of most of the actresses is below average and there are so many holes in the plot that a lot of things never make sense as if a 10 year old directed it. Needs better actors and better directors in my opinion, not just make the show about this nonsense and that nonsense."
I binged this in a day and a half!,"The acting is superb! A couple of the characters were definitely glorified extras. But I felt like everyone else, especially the main few, we're VERY believable and consistent. Christina Ricci might be at her absolute best here IMO. People can whine about boring subplots but you have to try and put yourself in these TEENS shoes. I feel like the side stories showed us why somewhat irrational decisions were made. The soundtrack was nostalgic for me, and the scenery was amazing.If I was going to nitpick, I would say that there were times I was more interested to find out about the past than the present at times.SPOILERS AHEADI would also say that for the first few episodes I was thinking they should just head in any direction to try and find their way out of the forest. Maybe they could've chosen a more secluded location, or had more animal attacks to explain why they had to stay put. I would've made the impending winter a more present threat as well. Previous reviews talk about them being clean.. they literally show a scene where they're washing their clothes. I also think they could've done better than having Misty destroy the plane's radio. One thing that could've made things more believable, the whole ""chasing down and almost slitting Travis's throat"" scene could've been a ""shared dream"" amongst the girls on their mushroom trip. That could've added more to the underlying ""supernatural"" mystery. I also would've not included the kidnapping at the very end.. Instead as the screen goes black we hear a loud bang that sounds like a gunshot, but in season two we see that it was actually the cultish figures kicking the door down..Overall I have to say I'm definitely looking forward to season 2. The acting, music, and ambience are amazing. I'm very curious to see where they go with the underlying mystery. 8/10."
It was an okay show but I expected more,"I loved how it starts but i felt like it was slow at times , it didn't keep my attention at most times but otherwise.i did enjoy watching it but that finale left me with more questions than answers during the season finale, I'm definitely going to watch season 2 to see how it goes after that cliffhanger towards the end, the actors did a great job though even though it was off at times...... I recommend yellowjackets for anyone who are into these kind of shows , the characters were annoying sometimes in the present and past. I felt like that I was yelling at my screen a lot while watching the show. Spoliers I was shocked on how Jackie died even though she was annoying at most times but I do feel bad for her and her family though... I was shocked when Lottie and Misty , Vanessa were on their knees at the end but I hope that season 2 will be bigger ......"
A slow burner that stands on its own,"Yellowjackets is a series that delivers good entertainment. I read that it is compared to the series Lost and the novel Lord of the Flies, but I think Yellowjackets stands on its own.It is still probably not for everyone. The first season requires patience for those of us who follow. The action also alternates between the present and the past, and at the beginning I had a little trouble telling the girls apart when the series switched between now and then. But eventually it worked out.If you have patience then you will benefit from watching the series. It is surprising, exciting, cool and quite different from the other series in terms of content. These ladies I wouldn't have unfriended LOL. I also think it is unpredictable and gives surprises along the way.Several people here are negative about the end of season one, and think it is weak. But it is clear to me that there is no end at all, only a transition of the new season that starts now. Nothing has been concluded, everything is set up so that we can see the development further.I still hope that the pace of the series will pick up somewhat, and that we as viewers along the way will be able to satisfy our curiosity to a greater extent than in season 1. Here there are many questions and events we are curious about...."
I can see where this is going,"I did not give this a rating yet because it is too soon after just watching the pilot. I am not sure I will even continue on as after viewing this so far one can see where it is leading. It seems that Hollywood is caught in a loop once again where most of the series are one type...this time it is horror...we have had horror/thrillers thrown at us lately with not much choice of anything else.I do see a major error right off in that it is difficult to believe that a group of girls would turn into a tribe/cult after such a short period of time. It is just not believable this would happen after only a year and a half...possibly if stuck in the wilderness for many, many years but not such a short period.There is also a huge geographical error. The setting where the girl's plane crashed has been described as Ontario. It is not Ontario. You can go as far up into Ontario as you like and you will not see a mountain range like that. Those are the Rocky Mountains in British Columbia which is almost 3,000 miles away. Also, while the girls are loading into the plane there is a voice coming over a speaker talking about weather and the Rockies... when Shauna looks out the window she is looking at the Rockies. They are not in Ontario, if the writers want us to believe they are they had better find different wilderness shots."
Best Shooters?,The girls should at least learn how to hold a lever action rifle if they're going to be supposedly the best shot. It's obvious they've never shot one in their life which pretty much destroyed the credibility.
Good yet unrealistic,"So, I have to agree with many others by mentioning that it started off much better than it ended. For starters, the fact that everyone slept on the ground one night with not even a chill and the next night Jackie just froze to death? Or the fact that a leg amputation with no antibiotics or surgery just magically healed properly with no infection? Or the stranded plane just coincidently had no big trees in front of it for it to gain speed. And what exactly caught on fire, the teddy bear? And why the hell is Tai eating dirt when she sleep walks? Does she even remember killing the dog? The whole spirit or wtv it's suppose to be was overly vague, like I understand suspense but this was just annoying. How about Shauna's husband that does not seem bothered one bit by her journals or that she murdered someone and disposed of a body. Misty, obviously is a total sociopath and I still don't get why the coach or everyone else take it so lightly that she keeps poisoning people. Or the reporter that can clearly see that she's crazy, injecting chocolates with drugs that could kill her father and is still stupid enough to smoke cigarettes or even drive a car that were in the hands of the nut job keeping her hostage.Anyhow, all in all it's got me hooked, interesting story, I just hope it won't drag along for too many seasons like LOST."
Wow So thrilling,"Just finished season 1 and i cant wait for the next, hope it doesnt take so long. Now i believe they are gona show us how friends started eating each other the friends who love each others sooooooo much, its gona be bloodyBetter make it better than seaoson season 1 and please dont make slow episodes cause slow episodes make a person second guess the showJust finished season 1 and i cant wait for the next, hope it doesnt take so long. Now i believe they are gona show us how friends started eating each other the friends who love each others sooooooo much, its gona be bloodyBetter make it better than seaoson season 1 and please dont make slow episodes cause slow episodes make a person second guess the show."
Too much draggy,"Just finished watching all 10 episodes. I was hooked and booked till episode 4 after that so many unwanted conversations, unwanted scenes makes it lengthy. In start of the episode 1 you will see something like Wrong Turn and you will watch rest of the episodes to know about that scene but after episode 10 also you will not get that what you were waiting for and you will have so many question unanswered. So watch it if you have plenty of good time and you have nothing to do."
Lord of the Flies with teenage girls,"I am loving this show so far. It's violent, it's so well cast, it's got mystery and secrets. I'm SO excited to see how this all plays out. Best new show on TV right now."
I'm not this show's demo but it's 100% worth a watch,"I'm a mid 30s guy who is open minded but my fav shows are probably what you would expect (BB, Wire, Succession, Sopranos, Fargo, etc) so when I saw something that looked like teenage girl LOTF I was skeptical at best. Nonetheless I've learned over the years to always give a well made looking show a shot and I'm really glad I did. This isn't going to be a pantheon type show for me but it is definitely one of the best of 2021. The writing is definitely above average as are the performances and if you're someone who likes to see different perspectives but without forced diversity for no reason this is a great example of how that can be done.I won't get into spoilers but take it from an unbiased guy who watches a good amount of prestige TV that this is def worth your time. After 2 ep I would give it a 6/10 but I'm at ep 5 now and it's now a 7/10 but if the story keeps going in the right direction as it has been I'll prob change it to an 8/10. Anyone can come up with a fun premise but this delivers on it and I've developed trust in the writers being able to take it in interesting directions which is sadly pretty rare over the last couple years."
You'll wish they'd all died in the plane crash,"What could have been good, became progressively worse. The set up is a tad formulaic, copying the theme of Alive (1993). Follows the story over 2 time lines - High school all girl soccer team whose plane crashes in a remote forest location and modern day where the survivors are 'troubled' by what happened in the forest (basically witch craft and cannibalism). Issue is you really don't care about any of them as the series progresses and most of the actors are just not convincing. Season 1 was okay - solid 6/10, but Season 2 absolutely stinks 0/10 - don't bother watching, imagine all the survivors bar 1 actually did die in the crash and it is just Misty's dream whilst in a padded cell - save yourself several hours you won't get back. Oh and a side note - who did the casting of the adults playing the teenage characters grown up? Did they pick them in the dark or something! Only 2 of them were remotely the same looking - 1 is so bad she should wear a badge saying who she is meant to be!"
A very good surprise!,"Honestly, I started watching this series without any motivation or expectation. I saw the trailer, found the idea interesting and decided to take a look.And I must say, it was a great surprise. I only give it a score of 8, because I know there are series above this one, and it wouldn't be fair at all. But this series is very good.From the characters, to the mystery, everything is very well done.The mystery left in each episode, especially at the end of each episode, always left me very curious to see the rest of the development. This coming from a person who hasn't watched a series in a long time, due to the fact that no series has that way of hooking you to know what happens next.In short, everything is strange, there are things that don't make sense but with time everything is answered in a clear way.Very good series, one of the best series I've ever watched."
Just brilliant!!,"Brilliant coming of age drama, amazing soundtrack to match. How can I describe this film .... clever, witty, dark!! Creepy!! Im literally going back to re watch to make sense of it all lol. I grew up as a child teenager adult watching Christina ricci she is amazing that girl is just brilliant. Love the girl power. Just yeah brilliant."
Can't believe I forgot to actually rate one of my top shows ever!?,"Yellowjackets is imo tv gold. I have never before seen a show written with such intelligence and with such emphasis given to individual character development. A psychiatrist would have a field day watching the personalities on display here. This show blows everything else out of the water in that regard. 'The wilds' is also a good show and will invariably be compared to yellowjackets given the topic, but yellowjackets has the edge, great acting, great loveable (and hateable at the same time) characters. TV doesn't get any better for those who like to watch complex and complicated personality types. I can only pray season 2 is as perfect as season 1."
Fantastic! Edge of your seat episodes!,"This show is so good, I started watching it by myself because I did not think my partner would be interested because they really don't like anything too scary, but they happen to catch part of one episode and said, 'I think we need to start from the beginning!I was ok with that because it's so good but so full of different characters and timelines.It's definitely keeping me wanting more."
Do they hold Nationals in Canada?,"Still trying to figure if the lack of realism is worth overlooking. The character development needs attention. The beginning shots showed potential in terms of developing the environment. However that was short-lived. There is no reason they would fly through Ontario, Canada to get to a National High School tournament, no matter where it was being held. Also, the shots were filmed in British Columbia, which is a poor substitute to Ontario. There's so much that is beyond realism so far that It's difficult to turn a blind eye to the story development."
Yellow jackets are awesome 👌,"To all the cast and crew, you blow everything else out of the water. I connected so deeply after my wife and I binged season 1 and 2. I thought about my military experience and even when your with your team you can feel alone. I was told once when I wasn't sure if I would come back that "" To exist is to survive unfair choices"". And thinking about it and comparing it to the show helped me to understand the deep emotions that were coming out. I rarely cry but it was overwhelming and felt so good to let it out. Thank you for this gift. I can't wait for 3,4,and 5. You are all so beautiful and very talented. I think, faith no more ""epic"" would keep us woundering, what is it! That is my question."
PartlyGood,"I found it fun and entertaining but it has faults.I really liked the flip between young and old, (thought old was better) and took me a couple of episodes to work out the links. I did find the young part a bit difficult to watch (parts were cringy not horrific just like I don't actually really want to watch this)...Up until the episode of doomcoming I probably would have rated this 7 or 8. But that episode was so epically stupid; the party and a stag hunt and when they started howling I just wanted to tear my own skin off; I may have switched it off and came back later. I mean if there were minus numbers - that would be that episodes score.Such a shame it took a such a complete bender in the wrong direction; up until that point it was a little like dark and from. Although with the body, crash, teddy bear, maggots, symbols, bone necklace - it is a bit slow to get to episode 8 with absolutely no links at all and actual understanding if theirs a paranormal influence, it's really lazy writing.The older actors absolutely nail their parts, all 4 are fantastic actresses and each of the four brings something different to the show. And each play their characters without fault, convincing, entertaining, and imo award winning, but I don't think the flashbacks serve to build character depth.The filming is really good too, I think the film crew and director did great. The sound effects and background music; some jump out like offspring, but then some soft tracks occur is the speech.So I guess it's the writers letting the show down for me; as it doesn't really know what it wants to be or where it's heading, it scratches on concepts like they will be used when the writers run out of ideas.So 6/10. Good but far from Great."
It's just so captivating,"One os those where you can't wait to see the next episode, even when you still in the middle of a episode.The fact that it feels like the series isn't really gotten to the ""point"" of the matter, is quite, well season 1, and it's not even startede yet. And i can't wait to see more."
A story around trauma,"I understand why people give low ratings. They are frustrated by the many loopholes and the show's focus on unrelated personal issues of the characters in the present timeline, rather than solving the mysteriesSo when I think about why I like this show in spite of all this weakness, I understand that I don't watch this show for mysteries. Because we already watched the best of that genre through many other shows like Lost as the most popular one (even though through the end, it was a failure).But apart from these, I like this show because of the way that it treats past trauma. I think it does a wonderful job in that with the help of great acting. So all those filler-looking present events happening to characters that seem like mostly not relevant to the mystery of the show are interesting to me because they show how the past trauma manifest in the present life of the characters.There can be a lot of loop holes in the plot but I think it does this trauma telling thing very coherently. Also I like how they include occult elements in the storyline."
Want to have a lot of unanswered questions?,"It's almost as if the writers read Alive and didn't realize there's already a movie then decided to make a mini series with zero plans for more than one season. Season two is an absolute mess with no direction.Even the finale was barely strung together with well, I won't spoil it, but in all seriousness this lacks good vision and seems to be a mixture of the Blair witch project and lost but I wish I had gone down in the plane or in the woods before trying to follow through.Apparently I need a lot of letters to make this sufficient to post.Really if they had wrote the season and gone back over the previous episodes it could have been a lot better."
Lord of the Flies With Hot Chicks,"This show is objectively good, if not great. The people who have left 1 star reviews for this show are all morons. For example, someone cited the implausibility of a girls soccer team having brought hunting knives on a plane ride as a reason for saying that the show is dumb; in fact, in Episode 3, they find the hunting knives in a cabin. The writing, acting, directing, casting, special effects, camera work, editing and music are all at least well above average; relative to the plethora of absolute garbage which never should've been made, this show is downright excellent.If you're an adult and you think the soccer players are hot, it's okay, because although the legality of the characters being portrayed may be questionable, based on the research I've been able to do so far, all of the actors portraying the hot characters were at least eighteen, if not well into their twenties at the time of filming; so, ogle away.The story and editing style is complicated and somewhat confusing, but it's interesting enough to want to put in the effort it takes to understand it. The confusion doesn't rise to the level of being frustrating and rather adds to the fun of watching. It's the kind of show you can watch multiple times and notice things you didn't notice before.It may appeal particularly to sub-adult and young adult females, but I think anyone seventeen or older might enjoy it. It's possible that it's intentionally designed to be a cross-generational type of show that middle-aged parents and their young adult offspring will enjoy together. However, it's not for everyone due to some graphic violence and disturbing subject matters."
Gripping... even if it's a bit gross,"I binged the first 2 seasons in 4 days. I was immediately hooked from episode 1.I have to say, I find the reviews that are disappointed by the show not living up to the opening scene a little disturbing... why are so many viewers so eager to see cannibalism?! Personally, I could do without those scenes entirely.I'm also a bit confused by the overtly high praise for Melanie Lynskey's performance here. She's fine, sure. But certainly doesn't steal the show for me... I'm trying to figure out if the character is a sociopath or if the actress is that disconnected from the character. Either way, it falls a bit flat for me and doesn't quite earn all the praise it's gained. Christina Ricci is fantastic as the adult misty, and Sophie Nelisse is phenomenal as the young Shauna. Aside from that, no one in the cast stands out as spectacular to me. Juliette Lewis is a great actress, but looks significantly older than her teammates on the show, which throws me off a bit.As far as the plot holes go, I'm someone who doesn't notice every small detail, so until reading some of the reviews here, I hadn't noticed most. I did wonder how they have yet to be found despite the black box being destroyed (wouldn't the flight path still have been tracked?) and did find myself surprised that none of those with serious wounds had acquired infections, but I can suspend my disbelief for the sake of enjoying the show.Those complaining about the gore and sex - this is SHOWTIME, not Disney. I'm not sure what you expected, but I for one knew to only watch once the kids were in bed.The quality drop from season one to season two was VERY noticeable. Even though I was bingeing and not paying attention to what episode I was on, I could very easily tell when it transitioned due to the drop in quality. Still, I found myself chomping at the bit (no pun intended) to start each episode.All in all, a very good, entertaining show that leaves me eager to see what happens next."
Love it!,"This show is right up my alley, binged it in 2 days. Huge fan and am waiting patiently impatient for the next season(s). While waiting I'm currently watching it again haha."
Great series,"This is a crazy story to start out for the young teenagers on a plane. It kept pulling me in to see what was going to happen next.every episode has you wondering what is coming up next, and not what you expect.Not sure what is on the island, would be nice to show us a complete picture of them. The girls play a fantastic part in the show, with a complete different personalities it really does work, and with them grown up they match up also. They do work together to survive by eating members, and fighting wild animals, doing surgery on a face ,having a baby
I'm glad they made a series 2. Hoping for #3."
MAY 2023 On season 2 episode 7-8,"I'm writing this review after getting close to the end of season 2. I have a feeling the producers and writers are going to drag this out as long as they can. They know the viewers want to see how and when they get rescued. They're going to keep milking the cow until it runs dry by going to flashbacks and adding drama with the current story situation. The stories are getting ridiculous but we're going to keep watching until we see then get rescued. Then, if they can they'll add some drama in after they get rescued. I can see them going back to society and having problems with other kids, their parents, and school. There will probably be some therapy involved and crazy stuff will happen.If you haven't started watching it, I'd recommend waiting until they complete it before you do. That way you'll know the answer to the big question is out there, and available to find out. Christina Ricci is great in this series and she's not the only one that shines. The chick from 2 1/2 men and Juliette Lewis kick some ass too. Also, the dude who plays Ricci's wannabe detective sidekick is good too. There's a film called 'I don't want to live in this World any more' or something with him and the 2 1/2 men chick that reminds me of their characters in this. I had such a crush on Ricci in the late 90's especially in the film 'Then and Now', or was it 'Now and Then'? It had that fat lesbian in it, I'm spacing her name but Howard Stern hates her. Anyways I'm getting off topic, but this series is pretty good if you have patience."
Amazing,Not even a single critic I can express. The only remark would be that we wanted to know more before the ending of the season but I guess it's also good to end things leaving space for the next season. Absolutely amazing entertainment and acting. Didn't rate 10/10 only because it's usually not really the type of series I watch. This one is a great exception. Don't hesitate.
Truly unforgettable series,"Yellowjackets is a gripping and intense drama that seamlessly blends elements of horror and mystery. The story follows a wildly talented high school girl soccer team who become the unlikely survivors of a plane crash deep in the Canadian wilderness. The film expertly builds tension as the girls struggle to survive against the harsh elements and unknown dangers lurking in the wilderness. The performances by the young actresses are top-notch, particularly the lead, who delivers a powerful and emotional portrayal of a young woman pushed to her limits. The cinematography and special effects are stunning, and the film's score is both eerie and haunting. Overall, Yellowjackets is a must-see for fans of the genre, and a truly unforgettable movie experience."
So tense! One episode at a time,"8/10. Unbearably tense at times and I could only watch one episode a night. But boy oh boy this show is addictive. So many people are complaining that it's not getting to the canibalism fast enough. But I for one am In no rush, I need to learn about the characters to see how they get there. I can't wait for season 2 and I'm so excited that they've cast Lauren Ambrose as older Van!As always Christina Ricci nailed this role! She is such a talented actress. She portrays it so realistic with her face expressions and even bodylanguage. Juliette Lewis is also perfect to her character. Keep it coming!"
It's Lost,"This is very similar to Lost. Starts out like it's going to be a psychological thriller then they introduce supernatural elements which go nowhere and detract from any character development. It's not very good, even though the cast give their best. It should have been good. But it chooses cheap scares and teenage melodrama (in both timelines) over any serious exploration of guilt and PTSD. Disappointing."
Very entertaining show!,"Season 1 thoughts.First of all don't watch it if you just want to find out what happens in the end. You know what happens in the end from the first episode. It's how it got there that's intriguing!Don't expect it to be very realistic or scary and don't let your expectations ruin a very fun ride of a show. I'd say it has a tasteful amount of horror but some would disagree just because it's not that gory. It's a great show for what it's trying to be. At it's core it's a drama series wrapped in thriller atmosphere and tied together with mystery.There is a lot of character drama (teen drama too) that is very enjoyable to watch since all the actresses and actors along with the writers have done a great job. It has a chilling atmosphere and mystery throughout the whole story with some very good humor that people mistakenly call ""unintentional"".Finally, if you have the attention span of a toddler you might find it slow paced. Sorry for putting it that way put just because it's not what you wanted or expected doesn't mean it is slow. I believe the show has great pacing that builds a lot of tension and keeps you guessing by constantly giving you bits and pieces of the story. It starts crazy and then tries to show you how it got to get that crazy.It's a really good show overall that's aware of its craziness and has fun with it in a grounded and fun way that got me hooked and wanting more."
Just a set up for season 2,"This show had a lot going for it - interesting story line - good flashbacks - good acting BUT it was basically a set up to make you watch season 2. The producers of The Killing learned not to do that the hard way - and I hope it is true for ""Son of Yellowjackets"" as well. I will not watch season 2 - what if they decide to string us along til Season 3? It's too bad."
Gives me nightmares but can't stop watching,"Maybe i'm just a weakling, but i didn't realize how gory this would be.. and it's not like outrageous gore, it's realistic and they leave the camera on long enough where you really get to see it so to me it makes it worse. Like watching this before bed makes it hard to sleep.. especially the ending of Ep7.. i kept having flashes to it. And it's not just the gore, it's also just suspenseful in general with the hint of supernatural elements. So if you don't like scary movies or horror maybe don't watch it. I just thought it was a suspenseful drama. Which is on me.. but just a warning. However with that said, i can't stop watching and I can't wait to finish. I really want to see how their progression to the cult arises and how they get rescued and all that.. but i know there will be plenty more gruesome deaths along the way. I just make sure I put on some comedy after lol."
Great Show,"Ignore the negative reviews, most of them are rating this amazing show badly because there is nudity and sex. It isn't a kids show, it is an adult show. The story is well written."
Oh god I love Misty,"Big fan of Misty; very smart, manipulative, and I found her very sexy indeed!! Misty by herself is a very good reason to give this show a shot. Other characters were also good except old Nat; I think she is very old for this role and I was not convinced with her acting.. Nat younger version was cool though and her acting was fine.The plot is not unique but it's ok. Also, I agree that the 2nd season is lower in rating than the 1st season. However, Overall,the show is very entertaining and addictive and sometimes funny. Totally recommend it for binge watching and can't wait till the next season."
Beware! No Happy Endings! Just don't proceed if you don't want to see this. Pretty creepy s**t. It's like to watch a descent into an impending doom.,"And way too creepy. I mean it's one creepy scene after another even creepier scene, if that's possible. All the characters are insane attached to a dark entity and doing even crazier things 25 years later.All the character lives are thrown into chaos and dark dragging their own families into this turmoil.And it's not going to have a happy ending, that's for sure!It's a creepy feminist series in their own terms.I need to take a breath with the end of this season. It's just too much to process, pretty suffocating at times, pretty dark. I really love horror and I have seen hundreds of films and movies but I've never watched something like this.BEWARE! NO HAPPY ENDINGS."
did it really just end like that lol....,"Why would u end a season with so many loose ends i was genuinely thinking ""oh theres gotta be 1 more episode i missed"" but no. Did the writers forget to add the end of the season or are u just that bad and ONE MORE THING if ella purnell isn't in season 2 there is no way i'm watching it."
SURPRISINGLY OBSESSED!!!!,"My husband always has his eyes out for new series for us to watch in the evenings while relaxing. It's not easy coming across series that really entertain you that you haven't had to restart a thousand times and rewatch just to have something good to watch.He watched the first episode of this and said it was OK and that he thinks it would be something that I would really enjoy. After watching the trailer and reading up on the show, I watched the 1st episode..... I was hooked. At this point the first 4 episodes were already available. I watched all 4 in the first day. I then rewatched them and learned you really have to pay attention to detail and I caught a lot of the things I missed the first time watching. This has made me watch the new episodes more closely.Horror is my favorite genre, followed thriller and suspense, for these in a good show, I am a sucker!!This is one of my favs. I am pleasantly surprised on how much I love, look forward to and enjoy this show!!!!IN LOVE!++++"
well-acted teen drama feigning mystery,"To be honest, it's easy to watch. The acting is solid and the dialogue is usually good quality (in that the characters are well-developed, have rich personalities even when a bit stereotypes, and actors rarely have to struggle with something out of character). And the way it pretends to be a mystery thriller or horror does make you want to keep watching to find out what might happen.That said, it's not really a mystery of any kind at all. It's more like two connected soap operas:
* One is a teen drama with a soccer team of girls stuck on an island with 2 boys and 1 man, and the crushes, and cliques, and jealousies, and in-fighting that all stem from that.* The other is an adult soap opera, centred on a few women with a supposedly dark past plus a bit of local govt politics, and the broken relationships, and cheating, and betrayal, etc, that stem from that.There are some twists and extreme situations that might superficially seem like part of the 'mystery'. But if you really think about what's normal for a soap opera, you realise it's just the kind of events that are typical of that genre anyway.Oh, the music is nostalgic for 90's teens and young adults, while also generally fitting the mood well. That's a big plus."
A dark thrilling watch,"There seems to be a lot of these kinda shows out on TV, however compared to the rest this is a bit more adult and twisty and at times shocking. All the actors and actresses are excellent in there roles and very multi layered. It does leave a lot of questions but looking forward to a season 2."
What was the Horrible Stuff?,"I watched all episodes and really didn't see anything too traumatic or extreme while they were lost. Ate wild animals, couple deaths, ate shrooms and tripped out. I guess it was supposed to be psychological trauma. ""I Survived"" has more disturbing survival stories."
"Great premise, poor execution","I am not exactly the bravest soul when it comes to watching horror films or TV shows, but this is about as scary as Goosebumps. I didn't need to close my eyes one time in the first six episodes that I watched.I think that the series would of benefited from being played straight up serious like a 'True Detective' or a 'From' as opposed to a watered down, teen comedy show (interspersed with their older version counterparts years after the events) with spooky elements added into the mix. All the characters feel forced to be oddball comedy relief characters with some pretty heavy movie land corny dialogue. I was already rolling my eyes into the first two episodes.. if you want to do great teen 90s dialogue properly, so that it feels natural, plenty of other films and shows have done it.Again, if they would've done this as a serious faced dark psychology horror show, with the characters who were truly scarred by what happened and the viewers wanting to have the events be slowly revealed episode by episode with a journalist or cop trying to uncover the truth, it would've been 10x better. The show struggles to find a solid tone and it veers from one bad comedy sketch after another to then serious topics like child abuse to then cannibalism. As a viewer, the cognitive dissonance kills the overall horror atmosphere and immersion that is wasted on a great idea."
VERY EXCITING!,"This is a fantastic, thrilling, well written show. If you want an on the edge of your seat thriller with plenty of juicy female roles then watch this. I cannot wait to watch the last episode today after work. The actresses are wonderful and the four leads all deserve Emmy nominations. Christina Ricci has turned into Kathy Bates in her wickedness. I just love this series and want the second season now, now, now."
Wow... so far all I can say is wow.,"I had very limited knowledge of what this show was going to be when I started. I read a few reviews, but this has by far exceeded anything I could have wanted. Beautiful, violent, gut wrenching. Every episode brings something to the table and I cannot wait to see what the ending brings! If this continues I will be changing my rating to a solid 10. I strongly urge you to watch."
Yellow surprises,"This was surprisingly very good, dark & heavy and bit hard to watch, but it was very good. Excellent plot and performance from all the actors. Loved all the twists and turns that added to the suspense that kept building up. Can't wait for the 2nd season to find out how the story continues, though I hope this won't turn into many seasons."
I LOVED IT,Love this show.it's been a really long time since I've felt this strongly about a show.I'm so curious to find out what's gonna happen next!The acting is great and everyone seems well cast.
Decent cast except for Juliette Lewis,"The premise is interesting enough to get you going and the actresses and actors do a fine job of portraying the trauma and dread of the situations both in past and present very well. Tawny Cypress, Christina Ricci and especially Melanie Lynskey have been so amazing in their roles.The story looks at first to be a re-hash of Lord of the Flies but I do not think they took too much from that story here. It has plenty of differences and tells the story well enough that I forgot about the similarities.Well, all actresses except one have been amazing I should say, really. Juliette Lewis has always been a terrible actress in my opinion and this show has further solidified that opinion. It has always confused me not only how she got put into movies in the first place but how anyone continues to cast her. Sophie Thatcher who plays young Natalie has been amazing and a stark contrast to when you see adult Natalie and it just feels like such a terrible decision to cast Lewis. It feels so bad and forced every single time Lewis is on screen.The rest of the cast and the story line itself definitely overcome and make up for the lows of Lewis. Looking forward to it's conclusion."
Hooked,"The first episode was good. I was definitely intrigued, but episode 2 was non-stop GREAT television! I've never seen anything I can compare it to, when you consider all elements as a whole. The flashbacks are seamless and help the story going without feeling choppy. The cohesiveness blends, while still being able to jump to a whole new storyline. Can't wait for more to come! I've been waiting for a badass show, and this is it."
Good but slow paced,"The show jumps between 1996 and 2021. Exciting premise but a bit slow, especially on the modern story line, slowly trickling out tiny details about each characters, which are frankly not that significant nor exciting. 5 episodes in, each of the main character in 2021 are just normal unexciting people with their mundane problems. Much more interested in the 1996 line where perky and pretty high school soccer girls turn into hannibal lecter."
Suspenseful and compelling,"Yellowjackets is definitely a slow burner filled with suspense throughout the entire series. For me I was intrigued from the first episode, wanting to learn more and more what happened. There is a very unpredictable dark tone to the series which makes it all the more compelling. The acting from both the teenage and adult actors did a fantastic job and they were paired perfectly, especially the actresses who played the young/adult Misty. Definitely worth watching all the way through."
"Amazing plot, but writers will ruin it if they drag it 5 seasons",This show DOES NOT need more than one season. The present day characters are just not interesting enough. Season 2 should focus more on wilderness and getting to the point. I skipped so much of season 1 present day character stories.
"Slow, incredibly painful to watch, but may have a very specific audience","I really wanted to enjoy yellowjackets, and conceptually its fantastic, on paper it looks amazing. But the whole back and forth from current time to past time sinks the whole show for me personally. The interesting aspect about the series is what happened after the crash, not what is going on in their current lives, they could have just got that part out entirely and made the show way better. The show is incredibly slow, and without any reward, sometimes you just watch 20 minutes straight of pointless talking and it gets nowhere. The aspect i liked the least, but might be something the bigger ""Drama show enjoyers"" like to see, is how incredibly difficult all of the adult characters are to watch, its just painful in some weird cringe aspect. The show is a smorgasbord of very heavy drama and psychological horror, but falls incredibly short on the horror aspect, more of a mystery show."
Awesome show!,"I was on the fence sometimes watching this, but couldn't stop! Binged in two days. The actors and actresses were awesome. If it didn't come together as it did it probably would have flopped. I'd recommend to judge for yourself."
From the very first scene- get ready to be consumed,"Yes the trim of phrase is on purpose considering some of the situations addressed in this powerhouse series
Also prepare to fall in love all over again with. Christina Ricci and Juliette Lewis who are both on FIRE with their roles
Melanie Lynsey is perfection as per usua.In fact - every single actor in this series is spot on
Well done to the creators and their production team to rockin out a hit
Cheers to season 2 - I'm counting the dayside closely as the gals did stranded in the past."
Can't stop Theorizing about what's Next,This show has a lot of star power. Theorizing about what's going to happen next is too much fun. Who is the Antler Queen? Who is Pit Girl? What happened to Shauna's first child?
Disturbingl,"The more i watched this , the more I think I've seen how far a movie can go, I think the writing was obviously good, however maybe I'm not an avid movie watcher , this movie was easy to follow, especially with the character flashbacks. Of course I've seen graphic movies before but wasn't prepared for a girls soccer team, doing what they had to do. I was engaged from beginning to end. I think only Ozark had me also hurrying to get home, Yellow jackets is not for the faint of heart, can't say what i wouldn't do facing a situation like this, but I do know if I starved to death what the other survivors likely do . Crazy but good movie."
Its too vicious to be fun and too predictable to keep our attention,"I've got little to write after my title but i wanted to like game of thrones in alaska, but like game of thrones i have zero happy endings to look forward to. Its sad and angry. Production is there but that's worth little if the rest is wrong. Maybe i'll watch it when i'm sober, that might make it palatable. I'm a sucker for production value."
Superb all around! (Season 1),"Top quality acting, writing. Creepy and delicious. The attention to detail is impressive with each character being as developed as they possibly could with such a long list. The cinematography is amazing too and the series has so far captured the essence of the mid-nineties so authentically. Well done team!"
A Thrilling and Frustrating Mixed Bag,"I was sold on this show on the premise alone. A group of teenage girls get stranded after a plane crash, and 25 years later someone is blackmailing the survivors. Its intrigue carries most of the plot on that trauma potential alone. The 10 episodes career wildly from completely riveting to rather tedious. It's a push and pull, which actually makes it compelling and easy to watch. It's incredibly bingeable.The characters are believable and well-executed, the horror is tangible and the impact of said horror is not underplayed. It is, however, not without humour. It's almost camp at some points, which is a tonal dissonance that actually really works for it as a twisted subversion of the high school flick subgenre.The standout is Misty Quigley, who balances both throughout. She's a delight to watch both in flashback and present day. Each girl brings something different to the group, which is really felt as they start dropping off. The soundtrack is good, and despite its bleakness, the show has a sense of fun that is sorely needed.However, it is difficult to care about marital problems and local elections when they're intercut with flashbacks to the most harrowing situation a teenage girl could live through, and I think this is where it stumbles. Episode 4 in particular is quite weak. I also am disappointed that the relationships between the girls seem fairly cut and dry; especially as what interested me in the first episode was the dynamic of Jackie and Shauna which I believe by the end of Season 1 has been greatly underused and loses a lot of the nuance that I thought the first episode promised.Still, it's different. It feels fresh. I love feral girlhood, and there is plenty of that. I hope in Season 2 they ease up on the women's relationship to men and focus more on their relationship to each other.Definitely worth a watch, if you have a strong stomach."
Sincerely Sensational.,"I cannot say that I've enjoyed a show as much as Yellowjackets this much since Game Of Thrones (excluding the final season). The stellar web of intricacies which flow throughout each episode with an incredibly cast and powerhouse performances, bring sheer joy. Juliette Lewis and Melanie Lynskey are phenomenal as are the younger cast. Astounded. What Lost could have been had it been run by these amazing show runners. Lord of the flies meets Alive meets early Lost. Cannot wait for each episode. Have re watched them. Glorious just glorious."
How does it end???,I liked this show early on. But was disappointed at the ending. Never told how they escaped unsure of completion of an end. Should have had one more episode tying things together.
As was pointed out,"The idea and geography make no sense whatsoever. An crash in southern Ontario (or even just north of Toronto) the plane would be located in hours. Other than that, this is just a really bad version of ""Lord of the Flies"" It's just a waste of space..."
Good show,"The show is good and keeps you intrigued, however, it's flawed as the writers expect you to believe that the 2 most attractive guys fall for the 2 most unattractive women in the show. I love Juliette Lewis who plays Natalie however they make her look like a drag queen and expect us to believe that Alex Wyndham who plays Kevyn falls for her although she is uninterested. Then there is Melanie Lynskey who plays Shauna and has the gorgeous Peter Gadiot who plays Adam fall for her when he is exceptionally younger and she is a frumpy housewife. I get it that looks aren't everything but come on! I chose to ignore that because I'm only on the fifth episode and it is a great watch. Also, in this episode the frumpy housewife and the hot guy went to a bar and they still didn't try to fix her up to where it might be believable. 🙄"
A brilliant work of art,"I hadn't heard of this show or any of the supposed ""hype"" surrounding it. It showed up on my Crave home page, I read the synopsis, and decided to give it a shot. I had no expectations of what the show would or should be like so expectations did not influence my opinion of the show.It seems like everything is intentional and the creators really know what they are doing. There are so many hints and connections everywhere and lots to think about. You can easily miss these if you are not paying attention but they are not essential to the storyline so you will still be able to follow along.Many of the 'unrealistic' aspects are quickly and easily justified if you keep watching past ten minutes or one episode (not saying anyone should do this, but many reviews didn't age well and are irrelevant considering many questions are clearly answered in the show).The (IMO very few) sexual scenes are not explicit or even sexy whatsoever. They help to understand the characters and their lack of boundaries, lack of interest, immaturity, etc.As other reviewers have said, it is dark and heavy and can be a bit much if you are sensitive to that."
Plot Holes the Size of an Olympic Pool,"I wanted to like this so much--loved the idea that the survivors reorganized into a cult. But wow, they don't even try to make it a bit realistic. For escapism it doesn't even come close to being engrossing enough.After the crash, one character has his leg amputated (where does that tool even come from? And then cauterized somehow?) and weeks later is tooling around on crutches as it he has a sprained ankle. In reality he would have been dead in days from sepsis. Also the wolf attack is hilarious--the mauled girl somehow ends up with just two red lines on her face that look painted on. No way could it have been stitched up.Then there's a cabin in the middle of nowhere that looks decrepit but later is clean and organized with tools hanging around. And somehow weeks into this life in the forest, they have clean clothes--a lot them--from pristine shirts, sweaters, and dresses, even formal wear, clean hair, etc.Somehow they have the time, energy, and tools to make a pristine runway for the prop plane.And at the start, how have they buried the dead into perfect matching graves with markers?Someone is always complaining about winter coming, but what are they doing to prepare for it? And apparently this dense, green foliage never gets any rain.There's zero explanation about how they're getting water and drinking it without contracting giardia. It seems to purport that they're boiling it, but no one is ever seen chopping enough wood or hauling enough water to do that. Somehow they have roaring fires everywhere. They never look like they're starving or suffering in any way except for some teen psychological drama. Jackie freezes six feet from the cabin. Inside the cabin everyone has padding and blankets for beds.And good grief, if there were enough berries to make gallons of hooch why weren't they eating the berries for food? As another reviewer noted, there is a lake but they don't try to fish.Ugh, too many of these details to list here, but they take the viewer out of the story.I was ready to suspend belief for the sake of the premise and moving the plot along, but it's too ridiculous--in the flashbacks and present day, too. Other reviewers commented on the sex, but it's quite restrained for a premium service so I'm not sure why anyone's mentioning it--there's nothing explicit and you probably see worse on basic network shows.So it is then ruined because it's one ten-hour long teaser for Season 2 and beyond, I guess. Not even tempted to look at another minute.Too bad, the premise is great. But if 10 hours answers nothing why would we wait for the next? So freaking dumb.Don't waste your time."
A masterpiece,"It's a fantastic genre mashup of survival epic, psychological thriller, mystery and coming of age drama, it's well written, well acted with stellar performances from the casts and well directed. The cinematography is superb with a great theme song and the soundtracks are so good as well."
All kind of genres in one series,"Excellent performances by every single actor and actress. Scenario is the combination of Lost , Pretty little liars , Haunting of Hill House and etc. Because in the series there are different kind of genres. Here include thriller , detective , action , adventure , drama ,romantic , dreadful. I loved the series. The final episode can be more interesting and there can be something for finalising accurately but anyway it was perfect and I hope they save the scenario for second season. Loved it."
Derivative Mash-up,"Imagine ""Lord of the Flies"" shot as a double flashback retrospective set in a Canadian forest isolation instead of a tropical island isolation. Now add mostly girls instead of boys and an '80's high school scene. Finish with crazy cult and supernatural elements familiar to anyone who watched ""The Empty Man"". In short, first season seemed derivative. Maybe second will be less so."
Best tv series I have seen it's awesome and addictive,"Best tv series I have seen it's awesome and addictive. It has a well written story with zero cliche and I love the way the cast and characters were building in the show. The crash scenery was the perfect spot for the show it was spooky, scary, heartbreaking, intriguing, and a thriller as it builds the suspense of the truth coming for them all.I can't wait for another season and I actually think this would make a terrific movie if you could fit it all in for an hour or two may not do the script justice like the series does.I recommend this show to everyone and no one has been disappointed yet."
It hooks you in but moves very slow for survival story,"I do like the series, but it lacks the thrilling suspense that the trailer shows bringing you to watch in the first place. The characters and acting are great, but not all the characters. It's too slow and does get to the point in my opinion. Still worth a watch."
the finale oh.my.GOD.,"This show was something i wasn't expecting,,, in the best way possible. Firstly, i absolutely loved the way it went back and forth from past to present because both storylines were engaging at the same time. I found the relationships w these characters to be amazingly complex and fleshed out, like i legit thought shauna was in love with jackie at first but when everything came out about the pregnancy, i was FLOORED. Then with shauna STILL being with jeff... bye she's the worst type. Then with natalie and trevor's whole thing, they almost made me sob when they told each other they loved each other like wahhhh. Anyways, it was engaging yah but that finale was what took the cake for me. That last 15 minutes was INSANE and i was left so freaked OUT like lowkey hyperventilating i wasn't expecting it to be that horrifying but it was so good, very graphic very intense very creepy and misty and natalie are deranged but the best <33."
Good entertainment but...,"First, the series starts strong as a mixture of different ideas seen before in series like Lost, or movies like Alive. Not original but interesting as the Pilot is pretty cool.Second, some of the teens part are annoying because of lack of great acting. Honestly, I prefer the Juliette Lewis than most of the younger cast.Third, looks like the writers got lost on the last two episodes. Kind of weird situations without any sense, and the worst is they don't solve almost anything in one whole season.So, overall a great potential series but somehow wasted by a predictable script, and without solving anything in 10 episodes."
A good idea ruined,"Here is another example of a good idea (though it has been done in various ways before) utterly ruined by atrocious writing, mediocre direction and very average (and sometimes embarrassingly bad) acting. The plot holes and errors are simply inexcusable.'Lady of the Flies'? They wish."
Yellowjackets crashed straight into my heart,"My god.. I've never stayed up this late losing sleep over a show. I could NOT stop watching it. You get hooked to the story straight from the start, and constantly want to know more about this amazing horrifying mystery.With spectacular character depth and development, as well as a marvelous portrayal by the actors Yellowjackets offer a fantastic coming-of-age plot mixed with horror that will send shivers down your spine. This is the show I've so desperately longed for to be created. I'm so glad I found this gem before it becomes a mainstream wonder, cause this show will without a doubt become a global phenomenon. 10/10 I can't wait for season 2!"
Juliette Lewis: a separate league,"Just like you have thousands of average singers, like Madonna for example, who rely on their looks and show, you have thousands of average actresses, for example Meryl Streep to name one.Luckily we also have geniuses like Amy Winehouse who can really sing and Juliette Lewis, a separate league when it comes to acting.For her alone: a 10. (But the rest of the series is definitely worth it too)."
Fantastic writing and characters,"The story is both compelling and mysterious, and every time you watch it, you pick up on something new. The characters are very well written and complex and portrayed by a phenomenal cast."
Lets see where it goes,"Pretty good show, moves slowly but lots of suspense. Kind of like Lost meets Lord of the Flies. Flashback structure is okay. Acting is good with the older actors. I will keep watching to see where it goes."
Yellowjackets gets a gold star 🌟,"A season of 10 episodes without one Woke moment is a very good place to start. A great story, an excellent cast and good, solid writing make for an entertaining black comedy. Can't wait for season 2...although I do hope it resolves and doesn't string us along for a 3rd season. Keep up the good work."
It's mildly entertaining,"A rather obvious blend of Lord of the Flies and Alive. The only difference is that it's full of poorly formed and largely uninteresting characters, overdramatized mostly inconsequential events and overall poor character development. In short, it kinda sucks."
Great show,"Great series! Been waiting for the second season but they just confirmed it! Has a great plot! I'm really not sure how far they're going to take it, but I did find out that they are making the second season! I mean they could go without a lot of the sexual scenes! I guess since most of scenes though are with kids that are in high school, the blood and guts kind of fits the series I am rating it at 10 because they are bringing back another season. The series also doesn't lack Special effects it did a really good job with all the scenes. I think next season is going to have a real good twist to it."
Not my thang,"Just watched episode 3 and after the second episode it was clear this wasn't something for me. Maybe if I were a woman I would have liked it, not sure. Juliette Lewis is wonderful. Most of the other actresses were uninteresting, boring to watch and / or hard to believe. Although episode 1 already made me wonder if I would like it, in episode 2 in the woods when young Misty out of nowhere grabs an axe I thought somehow they would have explained where it came from but they didn't bother. After a crash like that, to find something like that in a blink of an eye which is next to impossible to get passed customs is extremely lazy writing. Grabbing a piece of metal that came off would have made more sense but I guess they preferred the bloated drama take."
Dissapointment,"This show reminds me this meme with how the ad shows the game and how it actually is. It has an amazing first episode with nice writing, amazing talent in both timelines and an interesting mystery with the cult (?) in the Woods. And thats it, the rest of the episodes are teen and mom drama with bad writing.And i can guess that they gonna strech the mystery for as long as they can.Dissapointment."
Brilliant,Loved every minute of it. I didn't want it to end. Hurry up with season 2. Loved all the characters and binged watched it. I highly recommend and it was intense in places.
Very dark gloomy high-school drama,"This is a high-school drama set in a kill or be killed environment. You have to have guts of steel to down this kind of blood and gore, and that too thrown at your face out of nowhere. The young and the old version of all the characters are picked out meticulously and matches the tone of the drama pretty well. All in all a very good binge if you're into that!"
"Pretty good, crazy and unexpected","Obviously the premise is not a spoiler.....1990's girls soccer team crashes in Canadien mountains on their way to a tournament. This show follows two timelines.....one is the crash and what happens afterwards while they are stranded and one is the present day which follows a few girls who you immediately know survived the whole ordeal. What happens to the rest you have no idea. The first episode sets things up very well and makes you want to watch more. The middle episodes slow down for the current day timeline, but still tells a very good story of the 90's timeline. Then towards the last few episodes both timelines are very interesting and somewhat bizarre. The ending makes you want to keep watching more. You really only get more questions as obviously they are setting it up for a second season. The 90's timeline is some very good TV and far better than the storylines for the current timeline. But even that gets interesting. I will say Christina Ricci plays crazy very well! This is not like Lord of the Flies like I have seen some reviews mention, although I can see why they would say that. It does have a Lost kind of feel to it, but more supernatural in a way because some crazy sh** happens! I definitely want to know what happened in those mountains and want to know more about who survived. The actors are great in this show, again especially crazy Christina Ricci. Watch it for a crazy ride. You won't be disappointed."
Unique and suspenseful with girl power,"This show includes elements of so many entertaining genres and the way they are put together to create it is impressive. I love the flashbacks and the ambiguous suspense involved. The soundtrack is also incredible, as you would guess. And the cast! It's diverse and talented as hell. Have currently watched all episodes but the season 1 finale."
"Alternates between intriguing and, uh, ludicrous","So I binge watched the first season of this Emmy acclaimed series so I could watch the first couple of episodes of Season 2 and have some kind of a clue. Yet I'm already getting the vibe that I still might not have a clue. There's just too much going on--or as that master movie reviewer, Joe Bob Briggs, used to say: ""way too much plot getting in the way of the story."" I'm going to attempt to run through, at least some, of the themes. In so doing, I will spoil so many aspects of the show and its characters, well, suffice it to say: YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED *IN ALL CAPS* !Nominally, it's about a high school girls' soccer team traveling to compete at the national level whose chartered plane crashes in the wilderness (Canada?), killing their head coach and stranding them all for a mind-boggling 19 months. Slowly but inexorably their struggles to survive devolve into a ""Lord of the Flies"" sort of situation until something-let's say evil-has them in its grip. There are two timelines being revealed/explored simultaneously: one is the teen-aged survivalists and (some of whom will not make it through to the present-day timeline) as the adults now with PTSD.Three principal characters who appear in both are portrayed, in adulthood, by Melanie Linskey, Juliette Lewis and Christina Ricci. If I said to just ""guess,"" based on past roles we've seen these fine actresses play, you might peg a few details. Lynskey's teen character is cheating with her BFF's BF and as an adult who ultimately married him, she cheats on him too. Lewis seems like a wild child from the get go, fresh outta rehab as an adult in recovery, driving her black Porsche. And Ricci is called ""weird"" by so many others (and at all different points) on both timelines, her perky and peppy attitude (and copious blond curls) start to take on a kind of ominous tone. Do not let that girl near your food!""Minor"" characters, like Courtney Eaton's Lottie (who MAY have been demonically possessed out in the woods) and Liv Hewson's Vanessa (who definitely WAS attacked by wolves in the woods), turn out to be significant both for what they've brought with them and ultimately what happens to them. One thing that I can say about them all: I did find myself growing increasingly interested in these characters and their individual/team stories. So I'll report back here again after the much-anticipated season 2 has pounced and tried to knaw my face off, I guess."
Absolutely Engrossing.,"This series does not disappoint. I was never bored once, nor glancing at my phone.Yellowjackets is the story about a teenage girl soccer team on their way to the nationals that survive a tragic plane crash to be stranded in the wilderness for nearly 2 years.Though there are continual flashbacks and forwards in this series, they are definitely not confusing.The acting is absolutely amazing.Melanie Lynskey is mesmerizing in this series, along side Christina Ricci and Juliette Lewis.I can't wait for the next season of this series.It will definitely keep you watching, with some nice twists thrown in towards the last episode."
Entertaining...,"I didn't have any expectations going into this but was surprised by how good it was. To be honest it was one of the best shows of 2022. The writing is really good, acting is some of the best I've seen in a while, and overall it's just entertaining.I think Yellowjackets had potential to become one of the biggest shows, but due to the nudity and graphic scenes it feels kind of misaligned with the target audience. If the show had been more PG similar to other popular shows with teen casts (Wednesday, Stranger Things, etc.) the show would see more success in my opinion.I've also seen people complain about the pacing, but I don't have any issues with that.I have issues with a couple things in the show which heavily draw the rating down. The casting, relationships, and overall mature direction of the show (nudity/graphic scenes).If these issues were non existent I genuinely would rate this show 9.5/10, it's one of the best shows I've watched.Still overall really entertaining show."
Unsettling Lord Of the Flies,I went into this show with Low Expectations! There's been 1000000's of new shows lately .. this one is so good.. I found myself counting down the days till the Finale!! It's one of the better shows I've seen in the last 5 years that's not Game of Thrones lol.
Slow moving but intriguing with a nostalgic soundtrack,"Season 1: Near the end of season 1 you had to wonder what 'actually' happened though the first season. Show writers nowadays are masterful at delaying plot progression through the use of flashbacks, which actually make sense for this story. Hopefully it builds to more in time and the delay does keep you anxious for something to actually happen. I'm not necessarily the target audience (Gen-X and Millennial woman) but I thought the show had compelling enough characters, intrigue, and a stellar soundtrack that made it entertaining enough to watch.Season 2: More eventful that the first season and I enjoyed the pairing of Cristine Ricci and Elijah Woods."
Season 2 is too slow and too vague,"I have had to downgrade to a 5 as these series have lost my attention with Season 2. Season 1 was perfect and it paved way for a successful Season 2. But as we go dwell into Season 2, things are not so peachy. As everyone else notes; we as audiences, are no closer to the explanation of the wilderness, the strange behaviours the girls exhibit, or the events perspiring during their isolation (we get a couple of ""ooooooookay"" moments). I have persevered to the finalé in hope of some sort of resolution. But it left me feeling flat and disappointed. I feel this season can be successfully skipped if I knew that there was some conclusion in the third one. But I no longer care to find out..."
Haunting and layered,"I find myself still thinking about this show days after I've watched it. It mixes the gut-wrenching horror of the group's experiences surviving with supernatural elements and the emotional tragedy and turmoil that would come with being forced to endure this deeply traumatic situation. You quickly come to know and feel connected to the characters. It steers away from gore for the sake of gore and cheap scares/tricks, and is purposeful with each of its elements. The mood is well crafted and detailed, helped by a great soundtrack. The characters, the visuals, and the plot is layered and nuanced. It is striking and impactful."
Holy Hell! Totally invested,"Just finished binging all so far and honestly I am totally invested in this show, an incredible cast and acting is the real winner here, deserves every accolade. Series one was amazing but series two is blowing my socks off! I don't get 'stressed' or 'anxious' about tv shows, but this has me all ends up!I don't like giving away plot in my reviews and this is no different, I have seen that other reviewers have compared this the Lord of the Flies, and certain aspects I can agree with but this has so much more, the crossing between the 2 'stories' is so good, and in Some ways I agree that it could be faster paced but I hope it's building to something special, I hope it doesn't fall into the 'lost' trap and end horribly and leave us all wanting, but the feeling I am getting is it won't.I am a massive fan of 'Stranger Things' and this has the vibe of epic that I felt when watching this for the first time."
"Dam, i want more!","Brilliant and addictive show. One of the best series currently. The casting, the story, the scenarios, it's all strangely connected in a perfect way. I could watch this for hours, we got into it. Lot of good sense of humor, and that dark side of the story its so good. The mixture of the past and the present is very well done, it's not boring and it doesn't saturate, in my opinion it's that that makes this show addictive. Dont know what gonna happen, the story is not predictable, which is good because we never know what will happen, but dam, when i watch this, some part in me want to be part of that ""thing"" too!!I do a 10 easily. Can't wait for the next episodes."
Its really good!,"A fresh script, I loved it, I hope there will ve a second season, I recommend you!! I am sure Many People like it! Come on guys, trust me and give it a chance!"
"Not Lord of the Flies, but has NO ending","This is a slow burn. VERY slow burn.It can't be compared to Lord of the Flies, nor the guys in the Andes Mountains. At least not IMHO. So if that's keeping you from watching - don't worry. Plus - it has some excellent humor!It's something that a lot of people, me included, had to talk themselves into watching - and I had watched everything else - so decided to give this a go - mainly because I adore Melanie Lynskey and Juliette Lewis. AND you cannot forget Christina Ricci - who certainly fooled me looks wise.The first 8 episodes are the set up for the last 2. And it is at least 2 episodes too long. That brought it down a star.And the fact that there is information withheld cost another star.I'm not sure that if there is a second season of Yellowjackets that I'll watch. That said, I did fast forward A LOT in this season (when they were running around the woods) and I don't feel I lost anything ....."
It doesn't want us to leave.,"I cannot tell you the last time I watched a series that engaged me so much. I literally went back and rewatched the entire season right after the finale.The acting is fantastic, Melanie Lynskey really gets to shine here, and she's been doing amazing work for years. I bet Christina Ricci had so much fun with her character.The story!!!! I read somewhere (unsure if this is true, so take with a grain of salt!) that the creators made this show because they wanted to show that yes, Lord of the Flies could happen with young women. They set up what is most likely going to happen next season so well. You can see the pieces falling together perfectly, and yet you're still shocked at the end!It's harrowing and addictive, and I cannot wait to see what happens next."
I swear I've reviewed this???,"I'm going to put SPOILERS: First those complaining about the young cast being nothing like the adults??? They are even down to their voices. I figured early on this was not going to be like Lord of the flies or whatever. It was intriguing up until the last 2 episodes. Nothing points to them having done ""horrible: things while stranded. Now quit reading I'm going to theorize here..
I think Peter Gaidot ( Adam) is the kid she had in the woods and Jackie isn't dead. Somehow she's been raising him and perhaps recently died and he, going thru her stuff stumbled upon articles about what happened. Perhaps he doesn't know who he is and went searching perhaps he does. This would make for interesting viewing. My thought was her dream they showed where Jakie helps deliver the baby and it was a boy. Looks like he may be the age he's be. Whatever the car accident wasn't random. I hope it turns around because the last few episodes have been pointless! I also must add I love The intro and theme ""No return"". The female vocals sound like Lewis and she has a band."
This one is fantastic,"I hadn't heard of this until I was reading reviews of The Wilds, and decided to watch it. (For what it's worth, The Wilds is a *very* different show that just happens to have a similar -- but actually different -- starting premise. The Wilds is entertaining, adequate television. Not remotely on the same level as Yellowjackets.)This show is fantastic. The acting is absolutely wonderful throughout. The casting of the younger and older characters is supremely well done. The behavior of the teenagers is so well scripted and directed -- the side glances, the body language in general. I love horror and supernatural stuff, and I love how that element was integrated into the story of some teenagers traumatized by a plane crash.I really think the characters are all interesting as individuals and as part of the group. Misty is bizarre as a teen, and it quickly becomes clear that she's truly, evilly insane. The acting on her character is so good. Shauna as a teen doesn't yet have a huge personality, which is kind of the point -- she was always in Jackie's shadow. But the adult Shauna maintains that sort of bland exterior that hides some serious trauma and weirdness (but I'm not sure how I felt about her repeated insistence that she doesn't like her own daughter, who seems like a perfectly fine person). Natalie's back story may be the most compelling; I liked that it's clear that her self-destructive behavior (drugs and alcohol and promiscuity) started before the crash. I love Taissa for her strength, but she may be the character who makes me the most uncomfortable because of how she is hurting her son and wife.I could keep going but the point is I feel attached to the characters and very excited to see season 2. I think some people were disappointed that there weren't more answers at the end of season 1. Personally I think it was somewhat perfect as far as giving us just enough but keeping us hooked for the next season. One thing I really want to understand is what the heck was going on with Jeff -- clearly there was an ulterior motive behind his relationship with Shauna. I wonder if he was in some way connected to the cult-type people who kidnapped Nat at the end. It seems they are probably connected to Lottie, who was clearly developed as a cult leader out in the woods. And the cult must have killed Travis. So overall, I do think we have enough info to speculate, which is just where a show should be after 1 season.Bottom line: must watch show for anybody who likes mystery, horror, psychological thriller etc. I will probably re-watch before the 2nd season, which I have read is starting filming soon!"
Time to Finally Review this Blood Beehive,"I've been watching since the very second of the very beginning. This show did not disappoint or drag on, it got right into the nitty gritty of it with an opening scene that just started coming around at episode 8 of Season 2 and hasn't pulled the E-Brake yet. (I swear I saw episode 7's description state they were getting rescued back when 5, 6 and 7 dropped together on Showtime but you obviously still had to wait to watch the episodes. Then it changed. I wonder if the network wasnt locked in for a season 3 and had to be ready to wrap up 🤔). It is about time we get to the rescue portion of their journey though and I think we are all assuming the house burning down will factor into that. I've adored how it has weaved past and present throughout. The characters have been developed very well and of course there are girls to spare (Good forethought for the writers) for more storylines and/or surprises in later season(s) since it has basically cultivated and focused on just a handful. It's obviously a mash-up of the Andes flight and general insanity of survival through such a gruesome tremendous experience with enough witchy-woo woo entangled to really make you wonder ""What's goin on"". It's interesting that Coach offered for Nat to go with him where Javi had survived while he was missing and everyone thought he was dead on the same day she was hunted but allowed Javi to die in her place. If the house fire set by Coach leads to their rescue shortly thereafter then it also explains why even though Travis accepted Nat during the ceremony where Lottie elected her as the new leader (spot on timing to step down btw 😆), then Javi really did die for no reason and would explain why Travis didn't keep in touch and why he couldn't handle sticking around. I'm hoping Juliette Lewis isn't gone. I've laughed out loud since Elijah Wood entered the fold. He's added some levity and it's shined on the show. The cast has an actor for older Coach (Carlos Sanz) and older Travis (Andres Soto) although I don't remember seeing older Travis so maybe more storylines to come there too. Christina Ricci was built for her character. She's done an amazing job bringing Misty to life and I can't imagine that was easy. I don't mean to leave anyone out but this review is long enough already."
Just keeps getting more and more ridiculous.,"5 episodes in and just when you think it can't be more over the top, there's a freaking demonic possession? GTFOHCould have been a good show but they went the route of the ULTRA absurd, similar to Lost but somehow worse.None of the characters are likeable, either. Especially when they are adults. Just a bunch of narcissists and psychopaths."
So Lord of The Flies?,Yellow Jackets might not plagiarized but the concept certainly borrows from the William Golding novel Lord of The Flies. Instead of elite boys school we get elite girls soccer instead. If you can get passed that it's a good enough way to kill some time.
"Heavily derivative, saved by excellent acting.","This series throws every trope imaginable at the viewer; part teen romance angst, part survivalist epic, part horror, part supernatural thriller, part murder mystery, part blackmail story and part redemption tale, I'm surprised it doesn't feature a kitchen sink in one of the main roles. It even features that old melodramatic staple, amnesia; how could I forget that? Despite that, it works, largely because of intelligent writing and excellent acting from a very good cast, particularly in the central roles.The central idea, the grim inevitably of starvation with the arrival of winter, grounds some of the more obviously melodramatic tropes in a bleak overall narrative and is generally understated. Eight episodes in, this is engaging and entertaining, despite its obvious debts to other dramas, real and fictional."
Brevity is the soul of suspense - should have been a movie,"Interesting premise, well-acted but suffers from long format - this is NOT a five-season story. If they try to keep that cadence it will spiral off into Lost crappery.This would have been a really tight 120-min movie that asked a ""what happened to these girls?"" question for two acts and really explored what it means to be civilized and how survivors deal with re-integrating into the civilized world after being torn from it, but the side trips and ""featured performers"" will drag this into ""Is that still on?"" distraction at its current pace (don't say Walking Dead, don't say Walking Dead).Streaming services hunger for content is dragging short-form pieces like this into long-form drudgery."
VERY GOOD,"I liked this alot, I love survival stories in general, the acting was really well done, they left us with alot of questions not answered, but I heard they want to make this a 5-season show, hmm, will be interesting..........."
Love it,"Compelling, interesting, and so binge-able. Hard to stop watching. Don't want to give anything away, but you should absolutely watch it. One of my favorites this year."
Average but something new *SPOILERS*,"Ok im 5 episodes in and its ok, curiosity has got be watching further to see what happens.Few plot holes like clothes are still pristine, lots of energy despite us only see them eat on deer about 6 days in, not spooked by demonic activity, a coach who has managed to lose half his leg without hospital treatment but is fine etc etc.BUT I will continue to watch to see where it goes."
"Good, crazed tale a little let down by its dreary aesthetic","Does this series look uremically yellowish because it's called Yellowjackets? Who knows, but whatever the reason, it's no better as a justification than any other for the ugly, simplistic colour grading that pervades so many TV shows and movies nowadays. It's particularly noticeable here because of the contrast with the very well done opening credits, a punky, luridly coloured allusion to cheap nineties video. Like a lot of that era's actual media, those credits have a low-fi energy and immediacy you kill all hope of when you subject all your footage to a distantiatingly artificial tint. I think also especially here I want a bit more of that ragged, realist dynamism for such a crazed story. So much for media tech progress. Just because you have it doesn't mean you have to use it. As Milton Glaser said, 'The computer is to design what the microwave is to cooking.'The story's a little slow to get going and I nearly didn't stick with it, but it ultimately hooked me. A bit like 'On Becoming a God in Central Florida,' it feels post-Coen Brothers, a depiction of a world where no one is immune to madness, amorality and chaos. There might be just a bit too much going on and a slight tonal problem in the veering from comedy to straight dramatic horror or thrills, but, for the moment, I'm willing to go with it. Also, I didn't feel cheated that S1 failed to wrap everything up. There clearly just is more story to tell and it's fun watching it all unfold."
First two episodes has me real hyped...,"That's about it for this review.Yes I've just watched the 3rdf episode, and it was okay but the first two really hooked me. I was kind of hoping to let my life just rot away in it's endless mediocrity (not really but yeah) and watch the show but the 3rd episode was a bit less fun, just a bit less hetik for me.BUT BOY the first and then second episode. Left me on a buzz that I haven't felt in ages. Literally HOOKED.After the second episode there were SO MANY COOL DIRECTIONS the show could have gone, but the 3rd episode kind of put a damper on that, evidently the slight drop in script quality, perhaps due to different writers compared to the first two episodes. I take it the pilot had the highest importance, then the second episode, then they're going for the ""middle episodes"" strategy and for the finale they'll likely bring back the writers from the first/second episode. But we'll seeThe last time a show hooked me like that... well I can't rememberbut I've also not continued many shows that ia have liked...
I mean friends is one of them, also another one I need to watch.And also. TWD did hook me on and off, but that was like my first real show that hooked me apart from LOST. I feel like TWD gave me my depression, so there's that."
WAIT... THAT'S IT??????,"Ok, I started watching this and after the first two episodes I lost interest and stopped watching.After a break, I went back to it and just caught up on the two episodes I'd barely watched in the 'previously on'.I actually quite enjoyed the story between eps 3-9 and was looking forward to seeing how it would end, however the final episode literally ties NOTHING up.What about the spirit in the woods? Who killed the dead guy in the cabin? How could the supernatural girl predict events? How did the rest of the team die? Why did Tai kill the dog? Who really killed Travis and why? How did they get rescued???? SO MANY QUESTIONS.I assume that they are going to make a season 2? Either way I'm a bit disappointed as I thought this could have made a really great limited series and was expecting all the loose ends to be tied up."
Two major faults in the scrypt,"1) There are now flights paths that would go from New Jersey to Seattle via Canada. If the crash was in the American Rockies ( Montana, Idaho) then the crash would be valid.2) It would be nearly impossible for Misty to destroy the Flight Data Recorder from the air plane. These devices are designed to survive a crash, bomb, sinking in the ocean.The two writers did not do their research. PS there are other flaws in the show."
ADDICTING,"I am loving this show. The acting is great and the plot line is SO suspenseful. It's hard to even attempt to summarize this show, but if you like suspense and psychological type thrillers, give it a go! Christina Ricci is amazing, as are Juliette Lewis and Melanie Lynskey and Tawny Cypress. I binged the whole first season in two days."
Love this show,"Season 1 is great. Season 2 is amazing so far, dont trust people that don't like this show!!! I love the characters, I think the casting is great for both the young and the older actors. The story keeps me guessing while also leaving enough to figure out some for myself! Basically everything is important to the plot. The ""plot holes"" are because it's fiction television and don't pertain to the storyline. I'm curious to see how they are gonna fill 5 seasons, but we'll see!If you like a little bit of darkness and mystery, and if you have an attention span that can pay attention to detail (I feel like half these reviews are from people that aren't even watching and are likely on their phones) then you will like this show."
Doubted if I like it ended up loving it,"When I started this show I wasn't liking it at all. It felt to a housewife drama with some time jumps to the past not knowing what happened and who is who. Starting the 3rd episode I was interested in what would happen and started enjoying it more and more. After the second season I felt empty, I want more!This show is original and definitely a horror since it would become more and more disturbing when it continues. The character development is great, the visuals, the story. I can't wait to see what the third season would bring.Just try this show, it's possible you would love it as well!!!"
Surprisingly Good,"First season had me hooked right away with the opening scene. Admittedly gained my interest initially because of Cristina Ricci. After watching the first episode I was already hooked to the main characters and side characters storyline.However, the pacing is a little bit disjointed, although the acting is ranges from decent to supremely good with this varied cast of OG actors and new young actors, I will admit it's the younger actors who really shine, w/ the highlight going to the young actress who plays Misty and ofc the older version of Misty herself, Ms. RICCI.As of writing this I'm 6 episodes into season 2 and I am not disappointed at all. I'm hoping this show gains more popularity and has enough seasons to flesh out the intriguing and entertaining story being told."
Hmm,"Slow beginning gets confusing you can't do nothing but watch the show bc u will miss something but it gets better just gets u addicted haha 😆 I dk eating ur team mates is kinda f up hunt not oh hey I want Monica thigh for lunch barf An how coach dies sad but how they go back an fourth is Kool but u can't miss a thing!!! I had to
Re watch it a lot lol but I added show time to my paramount for this show but show time has a lot good shows we'll paramount has a lot shows I'm addicted too!!!! But it suck's takin so long to come back I hate waiting for it to come back!!! Stop 🛑 doin that to good shows or
Got to wait end of year to find out stuff bc how the heck they ended it like this show can't wait for march."
Hooked!,"This has been a refreshing new series to get hooked on between 'big shows'. With shows like Yellowstone, The Walking Dead & The Last of Us all either over or on hiatus this has been an unreal fix. The story line is so intriguing, loveable characters and enough twists and turns to keep you enthralled. The ol high school kids in a plane crash with teenage love drama to boot it takes a supernatural theme meet almost psychological thriller with hilarious bits in between. I feel like this show can appeal to all ages. *trigger warning* it does explore some pretty heavy themes but realistically and tastefully. Cannot wait for season 3!"
New Jersey?,"I finished the show, I have to say it was okay. The pilot wasn't the best but it got me intrigued to keep going. But I thought that the his show little more scary but it wasn't. In the past there were to many people. There was really no bond between any of the characters or the fact there are so many storylines that just spilt off. The future the whole Jersey location is a problem in it's self is a for me I know it's tv. But the present scenes have the same story line issues they couldn't focus on one character at a time and show those storylines happening with out the other character dealing with it. Also I didn't find anything scary about this show. Living in a town surrounding Middletown NJ looks nothing like
Jersey."
Excellent show- desperate for more,"Full of twists and turns and full of suspense.Characters are well written and plot is exciting.Season one has laid excellent foundations for several more series, there is so much more to be told about this story and I can't wait for it!"
Obviously not the Ontario wilderness,The show is good and entertaining but why say the series takes place in Ontario when its clearly not filmed there? One look at those woods and you know its filmed in BC or someplace similar.
Waste of time,"This show had a lot of potential but instead the writers decided to waste the audiences time with filler for 10 episodes. By the end of the season you still basically know nothing. Not to mention the fact that a lot of the story doesn't make sense. Spoilers ahead.First of all, I get that Jacky is annoying but you're telling me that everyone just lets her sleep outside in the cold to freeze to death? THAT'S how she dies?? Stupid.Shanna is a selfish and terrible friend both young and old. Speaking of which, the woman they casted as the older Shanna is dreadful. She has a miserable face, isn't attractive at all, yet her husband and random hot boyfriend both can't get enough of her. That's a miscast if I've ever seen one.The other actresses are very good though, which is why I'm giving it a 5/10. The show has potential but they just drag everyone out for so long.Something else that doesn't make sense is when Misty disables the flight recorder in the beginning of the show. Why? Why was it never revisited? I guess she just wants them all to be stranded out there forever so she can be the hero? It's stupid, and I don't care.You know what else is stupid? How everyone follows Laddie, even though SHE is the one that gave them all shrooms and tried to sacrifice Travis. If I was in that situation and had a troublemaker like that in the group, she'd be the first to be eaten.. just saying.Also, how does a plane just catch fire like that? Like it takes off but catches fire out of nowhere and explodes? Not likely.Did anyone think to write a sign for a plane to see?Legs getting chopped off and faces ripped open by wolves. No antibiotics needed.Travis is a weeny.There's my review. Pretty much what I expected from a Showtime series. Sub-par TV."
Amazing audio and soundstage,"I'm not going to write about the storyline, the dialogue, and everything that everyone else has already said. What I want to point out is the incredible soundstage, audio, and music in this show. If you have access to a decent home-cinema audio setup you won't be disappointed. The soundstage is incredibly immersive, audio tracking is excellent, and the soundtrack is phenomenal. If you were a teen at any time in the '90's then the soundtrack will take you back in time immediately."
invisible,"Before us is a series with fifty shades, but not of banal gray, but of prosaic mysticism ...And the story begins like this...1996 ...A promising girl's football team, with the biting name ""Hornets"", loaded onto the plane and went to some competitions ... The plane, as it turned out, had pronounced weakly volatile characteristics. And from that, he took it and fell, in some particular wild forest ... Well, they offer us to watch how those girls will survive in the bosom of the wild, when they use up the only tube of face cream (for all) and drink up the last can of *Pepsi*, with a large bag of chips, as the last NZ."
Addictive and suspenseful!,"Only on episode 4 yet I don't want to stop watching, yet bedtime calls! Hope it maintains the suspense! Lots of side stories yet easy to follow! I hope another season is approved!"
Has a few issues but overall a damn good show!,"Great cast! Good story and very intriguing!I'm just wondering about the huge plot holes in the story, like starvation being an issue right next to a huge lake, passage of time at points throughout makes no sense, and no one considers making a raft to follow the river and find rescue. Also people lose weight from long periods of no food and most of the characters don't even seem to be at any point.Also kinda messed up to have the spiritually sensitive who got visions just happen to not get a vision about the flight and only mentioned once.Despite those kinda things, it's very captivating and fun to watch especially since they actually gave women actors complex characters to work with and intense situations."
teen drama,"It does not look like a horror movie but more likely teenager drama, one boy among many girls, the story back and forward very tired too watch anyway some actress doing good acting especially missy character."
Pulls you in,"I gotta admit, when I watched the first few episodes, I was sceptical. Because Yellowjackets mixes genres that don't fit together: we have coming-of-age, teen romance, murder mystery and horror elements and the whole time I asked myself: Who the hell is the target audience? Turns out, me.Once you accept that this series transcends genres, you have to appreciate how well it weaves together all the themes of friendship, love, grief and mental illness, just to name a few. The performances of all the lead characters (old AND young) are completely convincing and manage to pull you into their life. You never know where the storyline goes next, and that's something I really appreciate about Yellowjackets. The look is great, the characters (especially Misty) are complex and interesting and the writing of the show with much attention to details is what I would like to see more often in modern television. I like where the direction of the series and I just hope that they won't drag it out for season after season.One of the few things that I didn't like was the end of the first season. Too many questions are just left in the open, without giving any satisfaction for the audience. Nevertheless, I'm very curious of what awaits us in the second season!"
"Good,weird good and surprising",Actually it's the first time i see a good tv series and I don't like any of the main characters. I waited for something to happen but nothing really happened we don't know what really happened there..did they eat one another? Or they had to make human sacrifices to survive? Was it a dark spirits thing or a weird cult? It was kind of disappointing for me unitll i saw the last five minutes of the last episode.then i had all the answers and excited to see season two .Recommended!
Visceral. Intense. Spooky. Thrilling.,"Lord of the flies meets Lost meets The Exorcist.You're not ready for a series like this, believe me. But if the first scene doesn't grab you and sit you in your chair to watch the entire series, I don't know what will.The acting is superb, the teens and the adults actually have the same cadence and facial expressions. The writing is in the format of ""This Is Us"" that frequently does time travel scenes, constantly keeping the audience on their feet.This is truly one of the best series I've seen ina long time."
"Great story, terrible storytelling","The premise and the story arcs are very good, but the incessant jumping from the past to the present and back is very annoying. And they stay on the past for such short periods of time that it becomes frustrating. It's like watching hundreds of mini-tv shows, each ending with a cliffhanger. No one likes that."
From Great to Awful in Two Episodes,"Episodes 3-7 are the most boring and cliché episodes of anything you'll ever watch.Seriously, even the ones raving about it, IF they are honest, cannot deny that you can honestly watch the first two episodes and then skip ahead to episode 7, (episode 8, preferably), without having missed a THING.In fact, you would save yourself countless yawns, and more so, the monotonous yet screechy sound of Juliette Lewis's blackboard-scratching voice emitted from a face that looks like it was mummified at age 642. (As a fan of hers, it pains me to say that, but it's true). Every time she is on screen it is an experiment in how long you can hang on before skipping ahead.In short, the fan boys and girls 10-ing this based on two episodes, have apparently lost their minds."
Brilliant series,Really enjoyed this series right from the get go. Great acting and interesting storylines. I hope there will be a season 2 as it ended on a bit of a cliffhanger and we still didn't figure out the whole story!
Overuse of Flashback Scenes,I gave up after watching the first episode. The plot goes back and forth between the present and the past at break neck speed. I loathe plots where flashbacks are used as much as in this series. The series might have been better if the plot would have picked one time period and stuck with it.
I love it!,I love this show but the camera work kills me. You can tell it's someone standing there holding up a camera on their shoulder because it shakes every time they take a step. I know this is so nitpicky but it kills me! Other than that perfect show. Great story. It's like lord of the flies meets clueless. It's nuts. I love it.
Not bad..,"Overall, we enjoyed it. My only gripe is Juliette Lewis. Nothing against her as an actor... it was just an odd choice for the ""adult"" version of Natalie.Definitely worth watching though."
Lord of the flies with women/girls,"The main thing you take away from Lord of the Flies, is that we're all animals. That young boys create packs and hierarchy, and become barbaric. If you're a boy, you've probably experienced this growing up.Well...all is fair. Women can be just as brutal.And so Yellowjackets says ""ok, what would women do if stranded on an island with no adults?"".There are some slow parts, but eventually you fall in line and are hooked. What happened in the past? What is going to happen next? Blood and guts. Murder and mayhem. Demons and witchcraft...If you're into the Black Mirror or twisted horror movies, you'll love this."
10 hours of pure nonsense,"WTF? I wasted 10 hours watching this garbage. Nothing really happened in 10 episodes. I heard they are making 5 seasons of this, who cares? This show doesn't make me want to watch any other seasons even if they make 100 of em. Wasted potential."
An eight as a cube of a pair,"I am a little hungry, mad about life and such, so, why not an eight?I just didn't see it all, (45 min. Ep 10) so I ignored, as a blessing, the degree of monetization...
Or pretend not to know.You did a great job over a theme one thousand times in the TV or movies.Interesting characters, explained by a belonging to a team of above average people.Yes, cannibalism is not so taboo, satanism, of voodoo like stuff, cults, sacrifices, are they?Maybe if real people were more problem solvers than inertial values, society would progress strongly.Having seen so so many plots over the years, this has been a watchable season.Rare at this state of my life.So, congrats, I always said women have more angle to do interesting characters.A scrip, an interpretation, things we have intended to do, at least once?A recipe above average. With a grain of salt.That's all folks! 🦄"
Backstabbing b#tches turn into witches,So you take a bunch of selfish winning Karens and and leave them to fend for themselves in the woods after a huge airplane crash. They dont stick together and work as a team they instead set each other up and they get sucked into a poisonous witches spell and canabilize one. Then they come home and start a freak ole cult. Great story great acting but i didnt care or worry for any of these people. I just saw this as part of the mass psychosis culling training our minds to actually think this way.
Don't like the canablism but this is a show to see,Okay so I just started watching this recently and I'm on. The second episode while I'm not crazy about the idea of canablism I absolutely love the show and I love the way it's put together there's no other way this show would have been a hit without the right recipe.pun intended. But it's one of the best shows I've seen in awhile so fulfilling and enjoyable there's action scares everything you want to see in a show like this not to mention good character development.
Fun but could be better,There's a lot I like about this show. But there are some really easily identifiable parts that need tweaking. Like how convenient finding the abandoned house with unlimited bullets was. Or Mindy being able to physically smash the black box that just survived a plane crash.If more things like Mindy spying on Juliette Lewis and saving her by eating all her coke and Juliette Lewis smashing up the hotel room scene happened it would really bump up that quality.
Bait an Switch,"Where do I start, I feel a bit of the old bait and switch happened here. Decent acting by the young and older versions of the girls, the issue lies with the story. Showtime sold this bill of goods like it was a Lord of the Flies / Alive reboot with an all Female cast stuck in a similar situation. What we see is not even close, sure the plane crashes but these girls do not really suffer the elements. They have a cabin, airplane, never seem to be hungry, everyone gets a pillow situation. Some of the girls on the trip are somewhat Bad Eggs, crazy and dangerous even. Some the the crazy things that go down are drug induced, along with some sort of para-normal activity were supposed to believe. This is closer to the show LOST than the above mentioned movies. This all plays out like an after school special in some episodes about drugs, God, teen angst about sex, having a period, feelings for the same sex. I am not sure I will tune into Season 2, I am not sure I really care what happens next. 4/10 for the acting, 0/10 for the story."
Actors in their mid to late twenties playing high school students,"It seemed like an interesting premise, but I couldn't get into this show. Early on, we're introduced to a 25 year old female lead and her 28 year old boyfriend. I thought surely she must be a teacher or maybe the coach, but it turns out we're supposed to believe they're both high school age teenagers. I'm sorry, but this simply doesn't work anymore in the 21st century, the golden age of realistic TV.Hollywood movies and TV shows can do better and have done better in the past. Take Saved by the Bell for example, or the 16 year old Molly Ringwald in Breakfast Club. If the production company is unwilling to accept the limitations of teen labor laws, simply change the premise to college students or an adult soccer team. Pretend-teenagers going on 30 look ridiculous to audiences outside of the US and pose a major problem for the self-image of actual teenagers, who see these mature actors waking up in the morning with perfect hair and makeup during a time in their lives when they're already feeling insecure and overly body-conscious. It's time to stop accepting the tiresome Dawson casting trope."
so good,"Great characters/character interactions executed by amazing actors, juicy drama, and some hilarious moments. I see some people comparing this to Lost (my favorite show), but apart from the premise this definitely stands on its own two feet. The mystery keeps you invested from beginning to end, albeit some of the questions are still unsolved (not that this is an issue, I want the mysteries to marinate for a bit). Looking forward to season 2! The showrunners are on to something great here, keep it up."
Fascinating but slow,"First episode was really slow, felt like a teenage girl type of series around dating and school. I can understand the need for character development, but a little too long here. Once they get into the woods that's when the pace really picks up and becomes excellent. The pacing for me, let's this series down, they could have reduced the timing or episode count as there is too much nonsense included. Hopefully season 2 can pick up the pace and removers the dead wood elements."
Something went wrong in the last 2 eps but still great,8 was glued to the screen for most of this!Thrn....not sure how but it feels like the writers forgot they needed to write for more seasons or they got this message too late from 'upstairs' and they weren't able to cope. Anyway: the last 2 or 3 episodes didn't feel as cool as the rest. A bit too much Fargo-wannabe-ism in the present day storyline.But! Still great entertainment with really solid acting by all (although Juliette Lewis went a bit overboard with her angry facial expressions imho).
The updated Lost we all wanted,"Yellowjackets delves into the lives of teenage girls stranded in the mountains in 1996, and their adult counterparts decades later in 2021. What makes this story so engaging is the simultaneous stories from both past and present, and the incredibly dark and mysterious story which unfolds.The main critique I see about this show is how slow it is, which is a fair point because it started to drag at times. This is however not because the story has slow pacing; Yellowjackets actually has perfect pacing. The issue comes from the story taking twice as long to be told from both timelines. Despite this fault the first season gains momentum nearing the finish line, ending the season on a strong note.Besides this one gripe Yellowjackets boasts a fantastic cast full to the brim with terrific acting, a beefy soundtrack, just the right amount of mystery, and character building that is next level."
Ashley Lyle & Bart Nickerson did an amazing job of it,"I finished S01. Been watching since it aired, but got busy these last couple of weeks and I finally finished it today. The last 3 episodes were my favorite of the season so far, to be precise, the last episode.In the last episode we finally get to see some of what is hinted at through out the season. And it was my main reason for watching the show in the first place as a horror/mystery fan.It has potential for greatness, sometimes it gets a little too much into a kind of weird ""housewives"" mood for me, but overall, I love the drama so far. It's the right amount.The characters have depth to them, and sure, it also feels like ""edgy"" and ""emotional young-adult"" drama at times but, that is understandable. So, not much of an issue. They are high-schoolers stuck in an unknown land with virtually no skills of how to survive out there.If you love mystery, horror, the unknown... then you will enjoy this. Whilst it can feel very slow at times, I love the way the show deals with its ""darkness"", it's like there's sprinkles of it but not much at once, you get a taste of it, from time to time.I liked the ending and am looking forward to what S02 will bring."
It's all coming together,Up until the last two episodes I would've called this show a 9/10. There were some just unbelievable twists and turns out in the wilderness I couldn't sort. It genuinely felt like bad writing. And THEN you realize the genre mashup here is essential.Perfectly acted by both the teens and the adults. Definitely worth diving in.
Lord of the Flies Redux,Admittedly I'm only a few episodes in but the series looks a lot like William Golding's Lord of the Flies. I'm willing to give it a try and hope it takes a different twist.
cannibal schoolgirls and secrets,"A high school girls soccer team is flying to Nationals but crashes in the middle of a wooded area. 25 years later, the survivors return to remember the dark secrets that they thought were well kept.The adult cast is monopolized by the 90s universe: Melanie Lynskey (HEAVENLY CREATURES, TWO AND HALF MEN), Christina Ricci (ADDAMS FAMILY, CASPER, SLEEPY HOLLOW) and Juliette Lewis (CAPE FEAR, NATURAL BORN KILLERS) who are joined by Tawny Cypress (HEROES, THE BLACKLIST), they play the survivors who 25 years after coming back to relive their secrets, because nobody has a clean ass here.What is clear is that something happened there, somehow they survived more than a year and a half in the middle of impregnable forests and with little it is assumed that they sent the great VIVEN but in a slightly more sectarian way.The series alternates two temporalities: 1996, the year of the accident and with the characters in their adolescence in high school, and 2021, when the anniversary of the tragedy is celebrated and mysterious postcards that reach everyone and an alleged suicide bring them the dark memories that they believed buried by a pact of silence and the years.The young cast includes Ella Purnell (ARMY OF THE DEAD, Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children), Sophie Nélisse (THE BOOK THIEF), Sophie Thatcher (THE BOOK OF BOBA FETT, PROSPECT), Jasmin Savoy Brown (SCREAM 2022, THE LEFTOVERS) and Liv Hewson (SANTA CLARITA DIET) among the best known.The combination of survival + mystery + horror + sense of humor + good characters, with ingredients with some LOST, some LORD OF THE FLIES, some ALIVE! And the student-oriented adolescent narrative, but with a touch of gore, led Stephen King to award it as the best series of the year.Far but sooo far the best is Ricci playing Misty, that raving madwoman but who ends up causing tenderness, followed by Lynskey who fits right into Shauna's skin, the chubby girl who never raises her voice and is impassive even when she has to dismember a corpse, finally Lewis who, emaciated and wrinkled as he is, suits Natalie, a recovering drug addict who drives a Porsche with a shotgun in the trunk.Luckily they have already renewed for the 2nd season because they do not expect answers to all the questions raised in these first 10 episodes."
Completely unbelievable,"I don't believe any of this would have happened. I don't believe that a single one of these kids would have survived in the woods for a week. They're all running around screaming like a bunch of idiots with period blood hanging out everywhere... no way they wouldn't attract predators pretty much instantly. And then it somehow devolves into cannibalism?That is the only reason this is even watchable; trying to figure out how the flip these idiots wound up being a bunch of cannibals. Most of the nonsense that happens after is really not very interesting to watch at best, annoying and fast forward-worthy at worst. I think the writers knew this going in, so that's why they showed their hand right from the get go. They knew they had to lure us in with something interesting because the show itself is rather boring.This show is pretty much unwatchable without fast forward in the later episodes. So much nonsense that either relates to nothing or we have no clue what it means because they've shown us nothing that it's just unbearable.Nothing happens in this season. The biggest event was a group mushroom trip which for some reason ended in them all thinking the dude was a deer and they should slit his throat. The big reveal at the beginning is just a carrot on a stick to keep you watching while absolutely nothing of interest happens.And that stupid crazy girl who keeps seeing things and can magically tame a bear and kill it with a single knife stab... I want nothing more than for her to have never existed. Her character is basically the sum of what this show is. Absolute nonsense."
"Female horror, should come with trigger warnings","The first thing that came out of my mouth when telling someone about this show was something I barely even noticed until I said it out loud. The female characters are actually believable and realistic. It's funny how you don't even realize that they usually aren't, because you're so used to it. Women in TV & movies are either empty robots or over-the-top exaggerated superheroes. These characters, though, are completely believable. They're flawed. They make choices like real people. And, they're actually intelligent and capable human beings.That being said, that makes Yellowjackets completely and utterly terrifying. This is pure psychological horror. And, to be frank, each and every episode should have come with a warning of depictions of mental illness, addiction, suicide, and trauma. It seems like a negligent oversight in this day and age. Personally, I would have appreciated it, especially toward the end of season 1 when things take a darker turn.What really makes this so unsettling is the uncertainty of what exactly is happening. Some have complained that the opening scene is never explained, but I completely disagree. That scene sets a tone and precedent for us to make connections. How did it get to that point? At first, we expect it to be a pretty rapid descent into madness. And, it is a bit annoying to drag out the initial wilderness plot, I agree. But, these girls are surprisingly tough, and it ends up being a much more complicated journey.One thing that makes it so interesting is their age, which is also depicted somewhat realistically. They aren't portrayed as older kids or yet mature adults - they are truly at that in between place where laughing around a fire while a gravely injured person lies nearby, is normal. They do not yet have fully formed identities or capacity for moral reasoning. So, in some way, I think it could be seen as an exploration how that time in one's life shapes one's identity, in this case an unimaginable tragedy. How would anyone cope with that? However , this seems more relevant if they were slightly younger (a couple years), as seniors in high school are practically adults. But, that also would have made several plot points more unsavory.Female identity seems to also be a main theme. We have a good variety of women who clearly drive the plot. The male characters are secondary and background to the women's stories, for once. From periods syncing to pregnancy, women's issues are there, and none of this is toned down for the delicate sensibilities of the patriarchy. The writing is unsympathetic to the benevolent sexism that often is culturally endemic, requiring women to be ultimately pious and guilt ridden for each and every mistake and deception. In some ways, this is the root of its scariness - lifting the veil of bias to reveal the true psyche. Maybe this is more terrifying if you are a woman, as we are so used to being hidden behind bias and innuendo. Being seen is the most terrifying thing of all.The underlying theme developing, entering into the winter and season 2 is a formation of a social hierarchy in the group. Ultimately, women are more social and can be more complicated in their relationships. This is excellently demonstrated with Shauna and Jeff, with Shauna having multiple loyalties and perspectives, while Jeff ends up being pretty straightforward in his intentions and behaviors. It becomes Jackie's undoing, who is ultimately at a disadvantage as a simple popular girl. She is used to being spoiled and surviving on good looks and favorable attention, which having given her the social advantage in high school, does not prove useful in the wilderness. I disagree with this writing a little bit, though, especially if Jackie is a narcissist, as implied. I think a true narcissist would adapt their approach, and I don't believe that they'd go out and starve or freeze to death over hurt feelings, either."
Ok show,This show has a good start with great acting and story line but boy is it SLOWWWW!!!! 8 episodes I'm and not much has happened yet... I'm going to finish it but I hope it picks up the pace with only a few episodes left. Fingers crossed!
Attention to detail lacking,"Though they have been stuck in the wilderness for months .. but still have immaculately clean ,ironed clothes. And perfect hair Every episode. The storyline is quite good though . But i hope it does not drag on for years on end as seems to happen with american dramas."
A lot to like but some of the acting is sub par,"Episodes 1 and 2 done. I really like the concept for this programme. It creates good female lead parts in a credible way, rather than crowbarring them into stories where they just don't work. It looks good, is well edited and has a good plot. The scenes 'today' as it were are much stronger than those set in the 90s, though. And that is down to the older actresses being masters of their trade but the younger ones frankly lacking any screen presence and looking like a bunch of extras given leading roles.This Isnt enough to put me off and I'll watch on because I love the modern day passages( Ricci is fab) and the story of the crash and what will unfold intrigues me."
Starts incredibly good but episode after episode turns out to be as bad as Lost,I don't understand why Hollywood keeps adding stuff over stuff to take all the demographics from impotent granpdas to desperate housewifes and also to fourteen yo with identity crisis. And in doing so loosing the good that could come ut of a good story. I'm not a fan of UK in general but HBO would have done it way better.
3 episodes in,"Ill watch anything with Christina Ricci, that bird is a trip. Great concept for a story but there are no characters so far that Im feeling the warm and fuzzy sympathetic vibe towards."
"Season 1 good, Season 2 terrible.","Season 1 was fairly good but season 2 was shockingly terrible. It was so outrageously unrealistic. The plot was all over the place and that made it difficult to watch. Big named actors can't save this show, it's done for (for me that is), I won't be wasting my time on season 3. I'm shocked it's been renewed. So many great shows get canceled and this gets renewed.... SMH. I guess I shouldn't be surprised by the adults behavior in this show, there doesn't seem to be much self responsibility. How do you teach kids to be responsible for themselves if the adults can't even own their behavior. Yet again though, a TV show is teaching morals or lack thereof, should we expect anything different. TV is nothing but predictive programming and propaganda nowadays. It's such a shame that season 1 started with a bang and season 2 has ended with barely a whimper."
An interesting mix...,"If we remove the supernatural and mystic, it's interesting how the show deals with themes like guilt, trauma, blocked memory, supressed feelings, PTSD,... and, in general, with its characters who just refuse to deal with their past that is constantly haunting them.It's an interesting mix of ""It"" by Stephen King and ""Lord of the flies"" by William Golding. In a way, it's says a story about ""what did happen to those kids, who were stranded in the middle of nowhere, after they grew up and had to deal with their nightmares?""If anything, for all its bad sides, it explores the dephts of human heart and mind, trying to explore how far are we ready to go for our own survival, and what will we do to justify/rationalize our decisions. And for me, if we look inside all the added crap (cult, Yellow-king-like mystery (True detective), call of the wilderness,...), the gem that's most valuable to obtain is the human psyche. Which nothing can really beat, it's enough to write a psychological thriller/drama in this case, exploring the dark and twisted dephts of our very souls, where humans can reach in the times of despair..."
It's intriguing,"Overall, I like the show. It's pretty twisted, as a horror lover I dig it... Good acting for the most part, pretty girls, some blood. The pace the plot is being uncovered is pretty good.Only thing that bothers me about this show is the usual.. stupid decision making in horror shows/films, I refuse to believe even 18 year olds can be as dumb as is displayed in this show. You can discount some of it to age and desperation - but definitely not all of it, I would give some examples but I'm trying to keep this spoiler free.But... this show still is suspenseful, interesting and .. fun, if you like horror. I hope they don't ruin it when more is uncovered."

Wow. Terrible,"Astonishingly bad storytelling. This was a complete waste of 10 hours. I'm angry that I stayed with it. It was almost comical. If they rebranded it as a Lost parody, ala ""Wrecked"" it might be worth something. But, sadly, I think they are playing this straight. I do love the fact that the main character straight up murders what seems to be a nice guy, and it results only in opportunities for comedy. Depressing stuff. Anyway ... tough to want to come back for a second season. The late addition of some supernatural stuff is more weird than alluring. Sadly."
"My rating is a 7, but...","The acting in this seriesis so believable and impressive! However, there are just some things u can't Unsee. It goes from weird to downright demonic and maybe I don't have what it takes to process this level of vulgarity. It's gonna be a NO for me. I have watched enough of this kind of ""entertainment."" What has the world come to?"
It keeps getting better,"Yellowjackets is one of those shows that requires patience. It is kind of slow at parts but As the story progresses it keeps getting more and more interesting. There is a lot of mystery that keeps you hooked a really strong cast and good performances. There are definitely a few issues though. There are scenes that they could have been done differently, sometimes things happen that get you hyped for like a big climax and at the end nothing happens so it feels a little bit underwhelming. Or sometimes they give you a few characters just to have them in the screen for a few seconds and that's it. And that's unfortunately something that a lot of shows do.Now don't get me wrong, I really like the show and I think that it has a lot to offer. And I'm excited that we are getting a season two. I just hope that they pick up the pace for the next one."
Great acting and imaginative! But ....,"As a Juliette Lewis fan and Christina Ricci fan, I enjoyed watching them in a series together. I like the show.... the acting is great! I got thrown off by some of the scenes that seemed unnecessary. The story has an engaging mysterious, but my attention would get diverted by some weird scene that felt awkward. The show is a rollercoaster, but not necessarily in a good way.... but at least they got to take mushrooms thanks to the gal that cooked dinner for them using Misty's shrooms. I can't imagine a worse situation to be in and be shrooming!! Lol. Love Juliette Lewis and Christina Ricci!! I think the show was pretty lucky to score them as main characters."
Doesn't make sense,"Watched all 10 episodes, extremely disappointed with the ending. So many unfinished plots and unexplained circumstances.Scary, not scary. Unrealistic survival, sex or almost sex, bondage and pycho behavior with no reasoning.Convoluted to say the least."
Season 1 is good set up for how the rest of the story will go,Season 1 is good set up for how the rest of the story will go with how fast everything changes in tv right now I often fear that my favourite shows will get the untimely axe but this show is confident enough to leave a lot hanging by the last episode. It has been set up as a solid foundation for the characters. Misty could appear as an annoying character for most but she has been the best part of the series for me. Christina RIcci was amazing!
"A solid survival series, notably for the whole sorority feel.","I had fun watching this series. Juliette Lewis was a bit stronger in S1 than S2, with her performance seemingly losing momentum in S2, disappointingly, however, Sophie Thatcher, a beautiful young actress who played the younger version of Lewis's character, remained fascinating throughout, and was more or less one of the two strongest characters on the show, the other being Christina Ricci, who gave a virtuoso performance herself, legitimately one of the finest performances I've seen from an already impressive career.The story is basically a high school girls' soccer team whose plane crashed in an unnamed northern wilderness on the way to a state championship, and the girls have to find ways to survive. This leads to extreme situations which lead to extreme consequences, and fast forward 20-30 years or so and you can see these same characters living with many of those consequences and the ensuing mysteries that enshroud their lives. A great female ensemble cast, even if the writing seemed a tad forced at time."
Interesting and Has Potential,"Overall I enjoyed this. I didn't know what to expect when it started. There are dopey moments, and there's definitely a few brain cells missing in the survivors, but it has kept me entertained over the season and left me wanting to watch a second season - always a good sign. Give it a go."
2 timelines where one is interesting and the other is a chore,"Without spoiling too much. I am 4-5 episodes into this tv series and I'm half interested and half not.Basically there are two timelines. The past timeline is interesting and suspenseful. A bunch of kids surviving a planet crash on an island. The future timeline is a bore, buttered up with tons of random mystery. I couldn't care less about the future characters and the plotline is just endlessly a bunch of puzzles.I suppose there will be a conclusion but the show is getting really hard to watch at the moment."
Hotel Caligula,"Not a horror, not quite supernatural, not quite a coming-of-age. Adult-Misty alone makes the show worth watching though. The way she handled everything was amazing... from the naughty patient at the beginning to her guest at the end. The rest of the show is heavily padded; had to hit the skip button quite a lot, except during the wilderness scenes. There were enough survivors in the wilderness to fill out the series, but instead the show mostly focuses on the mid-life dramas of just 3 of the characters.Sets, lighting and CG were unremarkable. Young cast mostly looked too indoorsy & well-fed to be starving in the wilderness.Things start to get strange close to end, quickly setting it up for a 2nd season."
Intriguing series that got ruined by hollywood,This series gave me serious lord of the fly vibe. Had me really excited and then it turns out to be some Hollywood influenced manuscript. I really wish they left out the supernatural stuff. The series had insane potential.
slide to ridiculous,"I liked season 1. It was unique, weird, engaging, kept the storyline interesting and moving along, terrific actors (besides Juliette Lewis, what's wrong with her now? She seems so twitchy in everything she does lately), etc etc..so all worthwhile. Sure there were parts here and there that didn't make sense, but it was so interesting it was easy to overlook, plus there was more interesting parts than ridiculous ones to have to overlook.That's just not true of season 2. They've gone completely off a cliff of any kind of sense and most episodes are spent by me trying to justify it's gonna get better. It has to, because it was already so good! Right? Wrong.It hasn't and here I am on episode 7 of season 2, Burial. Where some eejit thought it was a great story to let Shauna beat the crap out of Lottie. I'm not talking just a slap or two. This is a straight up beating that can kill a person only halfway through what this beatdown included. And she did have physical issues afterwards but it didn't really add anything to the story so it got brushed over pretty quickly it seemed.But this is a huge problem. They throw in vignettes of scenes that just don't need to happen and/or don't add ANYTHING to the story. It truly feels more like filler than truth to the story. And to choose one person literally kicking the snot out of another to the brink of death is a glaring neon sign of WTF are you people thinking? You're ruining what was a good show. Ruining it!Are they letting different people write each episode? There doesn't feel like much continuity of some ideas being followed here. I'm on episode 8 so I'm going to finish this season, but I am not planning on watching any season 3, 2 yrs from now. This has become crap and the only reason I was still engaged so heavily was Christina Ricci. She's still terrific in everything she does."
Interesting but so so slow,"The premise is interesting enough. But some of the plots are a little weird. It gets supernatural at times but it doesn't feel...natural? I don't know how to quite put it but it feels like the show doesn't know what kind of genre it wants to be. It all gets a little convoluted. You can also watch 5 episodes and next to nothing new happens. It's definitely a very slow, slow burn. Sometimes I'm hooked and I can't wait to see what happens next. Other times I find myself wondering when the scene will end. Overall the show is a decent watch. But I can't see myself rewatching this time and time again."
4 eps in and nothing remotely horrific aside from the stilted dialog.,"Oh well. Iv'e wasted more time on less entertaining endeavors, but I would like my 4 hours back, please.This show spends more time plodding through boring, anti climactic flashbacks and tedious subplots than exposition on what this show is purported to be about.It is becoming obvious that modern writing technique is tantamount to making sausage. It mainly consists of taking a mediocre storyline, filling it with loads of fluff and scraps while tossing in random sex and violence as a cook does cayenne pepper or smoked paprika, but only enough to keep the rubes coming back for more. It is how they turned The Walking Dead into little more than a afternoon soap opera with zombies.I had hoped for a rework of William Golding's Lord of the Flies with an added contemporary horror angle. I guess that will emerge in season 2. Sadly, I won't be around to find out.On the positive, if you are a huge fan of 90s pop and the ""F"" bomb, you will get plenty of both.....
Enjoy, I outta here."
Lost a good psychological thriller to a mediocre black comedy.,"Starts out with an interesting premise: Lord of the Flies with teenage girls, the display of human primal nature in a survival situation. The characters are watchable and we're curious how each of them deals with life and death dilemmas and their effects on relationships. Also, the story moves between the time in the wilderness and 25 years later, looking at how the impact of the trauma and the actions they took fester in the psyches of these adult women.But then . . .Seems psychological drama not enough. Story just had to introduce lame supernatural elements. Yet it gets worse, what seemed to be a decent thriller is ruined by pivoting to ghoulish black comedy, so now, not a particularly good thriller or black comedy.Too bad, a premise with such potential."
Ridiculous,"So many plot holes and people doing stuff no one would ever do and not doing stuff literally everyone would do. For example How in earth no one thought of fishing ? They are starving and living next to the lake in cosy little cabin that somehow turns in to 5 bedroom house where everyone has their privacy when director needs it for some stupid scene or other. Cabin is of course fully stacked with bullets and tools but they never thought of fishing. Also speaking all the time that forest is empty of animals is ridiculous. That thick forest in deep nature with lake and everything and without human settlement near would be full of life and with their unlimited suply of bullets they would be eating like queens and be making dry meat for winter. Also first stupid thing from beginning - they crashed in forest and never thought of making big fire with a lot of green leaves to make smoke and be visible from miles and miles away and from any aircraft flying in even near proximity. Any sane person would even when chilling in cabin spend any free time making and maintaining as big fire as possible because they were many kids in plane and literally all country would be searching for them day and night. Also with big fire and smoke if there is any human in area they would see it and come to examine it so girls wouldn't have to take a risk and try to find help like they did. Also 2 and half man lady is still sitcom level actor. I am sorry to say that and i love to see her and i am happy she is getting some work but i just can't buy any emotion or serious face from her. They tried in Last of us, they tried here but just can't do it. Rest of the cast is also B list but they are watchable usually. They just have little to work with, except overly exaggerated closeups of gore and flesh trying to shock us in cheap way even when cute girls are eating well baked meat they made it look bloody and disgusting. On the other hand after month in the wild with little or no food all girls are always perfectly dressed with clean clothes and hairs and everything. Just so much unbelievable stuff with lame mysteries and plots that go nowhere. Lame show by any means
."
"Really, everyone is squeaky clean out in the woods",I tried. I kept trying to kinda make sense of the plot but it went nowhere fast. All of these young inexperienced people out there in the woods with their clean clothes and clean hair. Nothing makes any sense. I tried but it's a hard no on this mess.
Self serving and goes nowhere,"After the first few episodes, I had high hopes for this show. The premise is interesting enough and the story has good hooks in the beginning. But all you get is mystery boxes and it seems to go in no particular direction. This is the type of writing that gets on my nerves very easily. When you have the creeping feeling that the show is wasting your time and the writers make it up as they go along. Character moments happen here and there, but it's mostly filler and I lost my patience pretty quickly. You can't dangle a mystery (in this case several mysteries) in front of the viewer and not give an answer to them sooner. Remember how Lost turned into a major farce? That's what I'd expect from Yellowjackets if I kept watching. I looked up how long this series goes on and was shocked to see it has 3 seasons. I was hoping for a tight 10 episode story, with a clear arc, not a convoluted, directionless mess. I hoped tv learned by now, that this storytelling style is just plain irritating. I like slow burn, but this is not that. It's a ""we have a time slot and we have to fill it"" story.The great actors in this show deserve better. And so is your audience."
Shaggy Dog Story,They get stranded in wilderness but don't try to attract the attention of passing aircraft with a huge sign or a fire? Somehow wolves only attack them when they try to venture off away from their cozy cabin. They have a big party essentially the day after one of their group dies in a flaming plane crash. What happened to the spirit who wanted blood? It just took a vacation? What is with the dozen or so subplots and endless tangents? Are they planning on sewing it all up in the very last episode? How is that even possible? I totally lost interest by episode 7.Terrible writing.
Could've been amazing but fell flat,"This show started off so promising... an amazing cast and creative storyline, only to reveal nothing of substance. Lazy writing, plot holes, unrealistic dialogue. I'm left feeling like I wasted my time hoping that something would happen when nothing really did. A few lazy jump scares, hinting at something that was never confirmed.What teenage girl would sleep alone in the woods? Why would a mom not explore her child's demented drawings? So much of the story just doesn't add up. I wish it would've taken the time to take itself more seriously. First episode was a 8/10, it just we t downhill from there. Could've been an amazing show, ended up being a disappointment. Don't waste your time, just read the spoilers instead."
It doesn't go anywhere,"The first episode was great, every episode after that was leading up to the next season. You start with a very intense scene and then you never reach that point for the rest of the season. There is no catch up. There is no parallel. You don't even know which player it is because she doesn't matter. But by the end of the season it could be 1 of the 10 who hasn't even reached that point of crazy or magic that hasn't been fleshed out either."
"Yes, it is Lord of the Flies","When a group dressed in animal skins, howl as they chase you down, and then later make an offering to a tree shrine, you are in LoF. LoF was about the break down in social norms when people are isolated.The pacing is dreadful as was the constant switching between three different timelines in the same episode. You see pre-crash, post crash, and current day all spliced together.I am hoping this show improves, the last episode was the best of the lot. Let's see how they develop the supernatural element along with the cunning but disturbed Misty (the only interesting character).No rescue for 19mo's?This is the weakest plot point. Ground control would have the revised flight path from the pilot. Yes, the Canadian Rockies are treacherous but a low fly over would spot the uncovered, plane wreck.A search party would use that as a starting point to track the survivors. 3mo's is believable and plenty of time for people to get desperate, but 19mo's is over the top."
Those Who Stay Will Be Disappointed,"I just went through hundreds of reviews and noticed that most of the 8's, 9's and 10's were from users who haven't finished the show yet. It started off strong, a lot of cliff hangers presented early on, and definitely prepare to be strung along. Most of the questions you want answered will not be answered and will become cliff hangers for season 2. I have never written a review for a movie or show but I felt compelled to because I really wanted this one to work out! :-("
Meh,I liked it at first and was especially excited about the cast. But with each episode my interest is dying. Plus the woke references here and there are tiring. Why does every new series feel obligated to interject politics into the story line? I will continue to watch but not holding out much hope for it to pick up.
boring teen drama,"Nothing happen in this show. I gave it a chance for the survival part but after 5 episodes i have to accept i've been fooled. Its just a teen drama in a different environment. The first episode might make you think its gonna be great but it wont.2 time lines, the first is about teens having dramas in the forest and the second is about those same teens now being old ladies doing some kind of investigation.If you don't need to fall asleep don't watch this."
Interesting Concept but Unbelievable,I thought the concept was interesting. I am struggling to get though the first season for a couple of reasons. 1) I am still trying to understand how they could be lost for such a long time in North America. The flight recorder was intact for a few days. And can you really just unplug it that easily and turn it off? 2) The characters are unlikable and I just don't care about any of them.
This train derailed for me half way through...,"For the first 3 or 4 episodes I was pretty intrigued. Unfortunately, it didn't last, and by episode 7 I called it quits. The pacing seemed to get slower and slower. The genre mixing got more and more extreme. One minute it's a supernatural thriller, then it's teen drama, then it's goofy adult comedy/drama, etc. If you enjoy that kind of thing, then this is the show for you. I also didn't care about any of the characters. After looking at some of the other reivews, it sounds like even most of those that liked Season 1 did not care for Season 2. On to the next series...hopefully one that knows what it wants to be..."
"Initially intriguing but ultimately tedious due to silly plot developments, much filler and being never-ending","(Reviewed after Season 2).1996. En route to the national championships, the plane carrying a girls high school soccer team, the Yellowjackets, crashes in the wilderness, several hundred kilometres off course. How the survivors managed to survive is the source of much speculation, even 25 years later. Those that are still alive still live with the events and others' speculation.A series that is initially very intriguing: the dynamic between the girls, the crash, what they did next, what the survivors are doing now and how they're handling the trauma. There's also an element of Lord of the Flies meets the true story of the Uruguayan rugby team whose plane crashed in the Andes. In fact that's why I initially didn't watch this because I figured it was just a retelling of the Uruguayan rugby team story, a story which has already been told in 'Alive' (1993) and other films and TV shows.However, after the interesting start the show proceeds to go nowhere, slowly. The survival aspect, the centrepiece of the show, is only one of many strands in the show and it develops at a slow pace. There's also a degree of predictability about it.Unfortunately, the majority of the series is devoted to the survivors' present-day lives and this contributes very little to the narrative. It could have been a great examination of how the survivors are dealing with the trauma of the experience but instead is simply a vehicle for silly, implausible, style-over-substance escapades that have very little to do with the events of 1996.By meeting the modern day characters you also know who survived the ordeal, removing some of the mystery.The only positives from the modern-day side of things were the characters of Nathalie and Misty. They're both quite extreme characters, played extremely well by Juliette Lewis and Christina Ricci, respectively, and the dynamic between them is chalk-and-cheese, making for some very funny moments.All this just makes the whole thing quite tedious. Two seasons, 19 episodes, in and the survival aspect hardly seems to be half-finished. The modern stuff has gone off in wild, stupid, random directions. By about three episodes into Season 2 the show was a chore to watch it was so tedious and half-baked. Clearly the producers are drawing out the series to the nth degree - more money in that!This is all quite sad as this could have been a great mini-series. A tighter plot, no random tangential stuff in the modern life, no filler, and the use of the current time to examine the impact of the experience on the survivors would have made for a great show.I won't be back for Season 3."
A waste of time,"NOT what it promises to be.I came to read the reviews to see if this show gets more interesting and starts to explore its darker Lord Of The Flies set-up only to realise it's clearly just another joke on the viewer, stringing us along to a season conclusion with a thousand and one unanswered questions so they can cash in on future seasons. How on earth could anyone enjoy hour after hour of unanswered questions and ooooooo mystery on this level? If this show was a person, surrounded with all this tiresome mystery and enigma, you'd soon be rolling your eyes and keeping the hell away from them. There's a great original premise here yet the writers have crow-barred in this ridiculous present-day murder-mystery/politics/affair/drama nonsense just to fill the whole thing out. There's barely a hint of the effects of the extreme circumstances faced by young adults stranded for months in the wilderness. Just a series of head-scratching mysteries surrounding the survivors 25 years later designed to manipulate an audience into binge watching to the baited conclusion and set up for season 2. That's all this is. There's no generosity of clever, thought-provoking narrative and storytelling. No original concept. Just another idiots' guide to stringing-them-along into a second season. I honestly doubt any of that mountain-horror epic storyline they hinted at was even fleshed out or fully conceived when this season wrapped. Just a weak attempt at a shocking idea to stick in the trailer ultimately hacked on to some mum-murder-mystery. It's an absolute joke that the number one priority of these shows is to simply stretch out a whole hunk of nothing in order to justify 5 seasons. It should be avoided."
Teenage drama,"I Just saw statistics for this series... US viewers rate this show more than non US viewers. Also Women rate it more than men. So it speaks a lot for me.Characters are very very Unlikable. Teenager versions of characters are even irritating. Dialogues sounds bad and forced as a result of lazy script writing.Some things are very unbelievable, How long would it take to locate plane crash in Rockies and assemble a search party? 3 days max?Also it is advertised as a Horror Mystery, bat as for horror part there in a zero suspense.To be fair first i thought it was about ""the Gilets jaunes"", french movement Yellow vests."
A waste of time..,I really wanted to watch this i wanted to know what will happen in the end but so disappointed by this coz nothing really happened this whole 10 episodes are full of unnecessary boring events just to lead us for another season. Why???
What is this exactly?,"I watched the first four episodes, trust me from episode one I had my suspicions that this series wasn't going anywhere, and after 4 episodes I was right. I kept thinking something was going to happen or be revealed that would make me want to keep watching the series. Nope. This just made no sense and was boring. The dialogue meh. Giving this four stars was me being generous. This show is over hyped. I did like Christina Ricci's weird character but it's like this series doesn't know what it wants to be so it ends up being a bunch of nothing. I think 4 episodes was 3 episodes too many for me. I'm out."
Please don't bite the mysterious vibe of the beginning!,"Yellowjackets has an impressive, intriguing pilot and overall a promising season 1 for many many viewers and that's the only reason of such a high rating on imdb. Enthusiasm leading to wrong conclusions with generous reviews and misleading everyone this way. And it's getting worse and worse changing the genre from mystery to black Comedy unsuccessfully by changing the plot so much as they don't even know what to write next.Thumbs up: 90s atmosphere, good soundtrack, Cristina Ricci, pilot episode.Thumbs down: Unlikable characters, bad script, Juliet Lewis, covered up misogyny, pointlessly brutal, boring, slow, shocking and disturbing just to impress.I really hope it will be canceled. Make yourself a favor and don't watch Yellowjackets."
Disappointing,"There's a good film in there but WAY too thin for 10 hours.First two episodes good but it was downhill from there. Kept watching, hoping for a return to the early promise, but wish I hadn't bothered."
A lot of build up for a let down.,"I kept watching because I had to know what happened and it was really good up until the last two episodes. Seriously though, the ending left so many questions unanswered. I hate shows that just build up all this suspense to get you to keep watching another season."
Interesting story but...,"Almost every character in this show is unlikeable I get it they're teens but I honestly just think it's poor writing because every decision the characters make will definitely leave you asking why am I watching this, is it based on reality or is it satire I try to laugh at the bad parts but it's hard when you really felt the potential in the very beginning. A lot things involving sex n relationships which makes the show just a teen drama that doesn't try anything new sure you don't know where it going at times but when they reveal the truth it's disappointing. Had my hopes high cause of all the good reviews but now I honestly don't know what they see, Good try though maybe the 2nd season is better but I'll probably won't see it."
Extremely Slow,"I agree that the show has great potential. The plot is good but not great but the series is just so dragging. So many random hints and thrillers building up and it never reaches to the point or whenever it does, it lasts for like 15mins and moves on. Nothing ties together well, it's like the directors' vision is to tie everything on the last few eps of the entire show or something. At some point, Im gonna have to turn off and move on because the suspense is just going away the more it drags on. Such a waste of time when this couldve been excellent 1 season 10 eps show instead of 3 seasons with 30+ episodes."
"80% boring adult stuff, 20% what actually happens after the crash","They tell this movie in two parts, constantly jumping from future to past where the past is the plane crash and its aftermath.The future (adult) portion is boring as hell with nothing interesting going on. Whenever they flash back to the plane crash, some of the flashes are literally 15-20 seconds long before going back to the future timeline.You take into account this fact, then the fact that they show you how they end up after 19 months stuck out there, you lose all mystery of what is going to happen to the kids during those 19 months.Does the future have a mystery? Yeah, a tiny bit, someone is sending them postcards with a symbol they saw when stranded.I only finished the 3rd episode, so 3 hours. But what this feels like is someone wanting to create a 10 season show by making everything go so painfully slow, it will take that long to tell the whole story.I'll revisit after it finishes airing, maybe it turns around."
Mostly for female audience,"The tittle of my review pretty much sums it up. And it is not necessarily a bad thing. Watchable, Versatile, Full of Drama and even coming of age type of aspects at some points.My personal humble opinion is that TV series are almost divided into 2 separate TV shows. While I did enjoy the crash in the wilderness part, the all-female drama of the present day narrative was a bit boring to my taste.Series deal with shadows selves, survival and repercussions of past actions.After watching 2 episodes i decided to quit this show. The main reason was that the ""adventure"" part of it is very miniscule compared to the main present day narrative. I simply find it irritating to watch a standard drama only hoping to see more of the ""after the crash"" scenes.I liked the idea of the show, but for me personally it does seem like a wasted potential. Good acting, good budget, great actors. Bad narrative building.I do not hate this show, but it is not to my liking unfortunately. Despite it's shortcomings it is well received by the female audience (and not only) so it must have some charm."
I'm just watching season 1 to see how this train wreck ends,"The premise of a modern female-centric Lord of the Flies and what happens after the survivors were rescued intrigued me. But it quickly turned into a boring and very poorly written teen soap opera. It's unbelievable that none of the plane crash survivors work towards actually getting rescued. One of my biggest complaints is that we never see what their families were doing or going through during all the months the girls were missing. A private plane was chartered to take a soccer team across the country. Didn't the owner of the plane or families of the crew members and passengers bother looking for them? The survivors manage to stay well groomed, one character (Nat) somehow keep her roots touched up, make no attempt to be rescued, while poorly imitating Mean Girls. All of the characters are annoying and unlikeable,Another beef: the surviving coach teaches the girls to use a hunting rifle stating he hunted with his father. Didn't his father teach him how to track animals, too? If he's ""the only adult"", why isn't he being more proactive in getting everyone rescued? Hasn't anyone thought about the plane's black box? Was there no first aid kit on the plane?We are going to watch the finale for closure, although my husband just told me he saw an article indicating the show's concept was for 5 years. Big nope for us. The series Lost started out ok, but got worse and much more ridiculous as it dragged on. This show managed to be ridiculous within 3 episodes. In Lost, the island didn't want the plane crash survivors to leave. Someone from the Yellowjackets team says the forest doesn't want them to leave. Too many plot holes, bad dialogue, and unanswered questions. Not willing to waste any more time on this bomb.One positive note; Melanie Lynskey is a realist middle aged woman as far as body size goes. It's refreshing and in no way meant as a negative comment."
Predictably Lame: This contains no spoilers. There's nothing to spoil.,"Great cast wasted on a lame script. The thing about suspense thrillers is that it's essential for the plot to, you know, build suspense. Unfortunately everything about this stinking extrusion is predictable."
"Boring, dull, characters you can't stand","The only characters that are either so terrible you like them or are cool are Juliette Lewis's broken Natalie and Cristina Ricci's sociopathic Misty. None of the other characters are likable in ANY WAY WHATSOEVER and it is painful. So painful. This is not an original concept to grace us on Amazon either, let's remember just last year this same show was out almost word for word to the point that you could mix the trailers and no one would know (teen girls plane crash island lord the flies etc....). Bottom line is that it does not live up to any hype and the character writing is a massive let down."
slowly but surely,Maybe the writers didn't expect a second season.It was disappointing to say the least.Come the finale this show is a complete and utter mess.Balancing horror and comedy/farce takes skill and this show doesn not have it. A lot of this season didn't have any plausability. The cannibalism element was just so badly handled. I think the actors gave their best but the script was pants and got progressively worse as the season went on.I won't be waiting for another season.Maybe the writers didn't expect a second season.It was disappointing to say the least.Come the finale this show is a complete and utter mess.Balancing horror and comedy/farce takes skill and this show doesn not have it.

Does not live up to the hype,I was struggling to find a reason to continue watching after the second episode. Using sex as one of the main connection to the characters fails in this show. Episodes were felt dragged out. The acting was good but overall a big swing and miss.
Freakshow,"I have never left a review on this app before, but I have to for this show. This show is so overhyped and so cringe worthy. The acting is over acting, the plot is dumb, the characters all dont have a single redeeming quality, and what the hell even is the mystery? Just walk out of the freaking woods!!! If you like watching high schoolers have sex for 30 out 50 minutes for an episode and up close gore shots this might be for you, but your probably a weirdo in real life if you like to watch those things. Me personally, I dont find that particularly entertaining and enjoyable to watch. Most overhyped show i can remember in a while."
Boring..,"Nothing happens and season one is over... this is lost over again, building up like something exiting..and then crashes into nothing or something stupid.. i dont even think the writer know ehat is going to happen, its like writing a book whatever falls into your mind...i dont get how great series like timeless or the OA can get cancelled and this can go on..."
Was expecting way more!!!,"When i heard about this show and then seen the critic reviews I was very excited, these type of shows are right up my alley but man it's mostly a snooze fest. I'm 5 episodes in cause I started it and unless a show is Brutal I'll finish it but really nothing special at all. Then the timeline jumps are not done well at all (Lost) did it great, you get confused and I didn't even know who was who until a couple episodes in. Big letdown for me."
Sprinkle of entertaining plot,This show shares the same premise as the book Lord of the Flies but what makes it more interesting is the older and more mature characters that get stranded in the wilderness after a plane crash. There aren't peculiar themes such as those found in the book I mentioned. Instead of exploring the edges to man's rationality you get teenage drama but it is well acted.I would remove the first episode all together. The supernatural element of the series isn't explicable touched on until half way through the show. This being a 10 episode show that are an hour long you spend 2 movies worth of time vague to how this show stands apart from other similar stories of survival. However I would have been pleased with a simple story focused on the young adolescents.Starting from the moment you are introduced to the opening credits you should stop watching this show. The opening credits consists of annoying music and incoherent snippets of the show on the style of VHS playback. The consistent but unexpected jumping from the modern day story to the past is an uninspired trope that I remember from the show Arrow. The adult characters are all losers and degenerates. Nobody is worth rooting for.This show has nothing to offer other than the mature exploration for survival from a teenagers points of view. While the performances are great for that aspect the rest of show faulters to a slow and boring pace. Uneventful for most of the series. Needlessly long and too many episodes. It is a hard but disappointing skip.
Very optimistic start but then the writers put it on the auto-pilot.,"The first season was undoubtely a blast. This TV show had a very promising start. The intriguing story of female, plane crush survivors fighting for their lives back in the 90s. I mean. WOW. Every episode of the first season was captivating and interesting, leaving you wanting more. At the very end of the first season you could see a very optimistic potential of developing and exploring the show in many different levels.But then came the 2nd season.I couldn't stop wondering ""What the hell happened to the writters of this show? "" The whole second season was a terrible, never ending loop of not getting anywhere with this story. Even with some small ups and downs in the development of the story, during second season, we get back to where we started from.The end of the second season was dry and predictable; an insult to viewer's intelligence."
Gilligan's Island meets Goosebumps,"Watchable, if you muster up all the credulity you can. Yellojackets reminds me of more of Gilligan's Island (where food, potable water, etc. Were never a concern) than Lord of the Flies. Despite these essentials (and no survival skills), they seem to have plenty of time to romp, swim, write and bicker at each other. Oh, that's right, they bagged a deer - well, everything is OK now! Almost time for a sing-along!As others have already pointed out, it's difficuly at times to reconcile the ""young"" and ""older"" versions of the characters.Could have been much better, it's a shame that Juliette Lewis and Christina Ricchi didn't have more to work with."
Chomps down on itself after the first few episodes,"This show had an interesting premise but nothing after the first two episodes convinced me that this shouldn't have been a miniseries or a film instead.I struggle with this show because some characters have meat (especially Jackie and Misty) and the actors are some of my favourites (particularly Christina Ricci, Juliette Lewis and Melanie Lynskey). There are also some engaging moments in spurts and the end credits music is a certified banger.However, the fact is that the central premise doesn't lend itself to a story worth telling over multiple seasons. There's no reason to be interested in the present lives of the adults. The past meanders more than it should and leads nowhere new. The ending to the two biggest mysteries (Jackie in the past and Adam in the present) were cop outs.This is a perfect case of a show relying too early on fan culture and theories to keep it going. This can't be manufactured by just witholding information, it has to be organic. It has to be FUN. I won't be surprised if the show nosedives in the second season. That being said, I do hope I'm wrong and it does make me reconsider everything I'm writing here.But if it weren't for the positive reactions on the internet (which I wonder is because most Americans grew up on Lord of the Flies), I wouldn't have gone past the pilot just to see what the fuss was about.Turns out, I'd rather watch Lost again instead.Or critics and the internet folk should be watching the other show with Yellow in the title."
Episode 6 and still nothing happened!,If you want to waste 6 hours from your life just to see girls in the woods doing nonsense go for it. Nothing make sense and nothing happens. 2 starts maxim. I dont understand the hype🤷‍♂️
Season one good season two poor,"I really enjoyed season one and was looking forward to season two. However I have never been so disappointed with a second season as I have with this show.I don't know what the writing was about and lost interest after the first few episodes. I have now watched the whole season and wish that I hadn't wasted my time. I for one won't be bothering with the next season as it looks like it's going to be another ""Lost"" where the end is never really explained.There are plenty more better shows out there. So if you're are like me an impatient with the storyline I wouldn't bother starting it. Re watch one of your old favourite shows rather than wasting your time on this one."
Why am I still watching this horrible show?,"I'm almost through season 2. And I still can't figure out why I'm still watching this dumb show. It just rambles on without providing any answers to the mysteries that it presents. Oddly one of my biggest pet peeves is with the character, Thai. She was elected senator at the beginning of season 1 and now here we are at the end of season 2 and she just keeps going down a rabbit hole of exhibiting a split personality. Doesn't she have any government duties she needs to attend to? Her wife is in the hospital after car accident that she caused. And who is taking care of her son while she takes off to join her friends cult with her ex-girlfriend. This is a tiny example of how silly this show is. Jokes on me though I guess. I'm the one still watching it!"
So Sloooooooooow,"First two episodes were good enough, but for those following I started dozing off. If it were just one season comprised of 10 episodes, I'd still be bored. Knowing, however, that there will be multiple seasons is unfathomable. It should have been a six episode mini series (aka ""limited series"") to keep the story tight and interesting."
Boring and slow.,"This show is so slow and nothing develops in the entire season. The writers are awful. Don't waste your time like I did and watch a different show. It was actually painful to have to sit through to the end of this season. It has two stars for christina ricci as her acting was great. The high reviews are from people who have only watched the first two episodes, it is gripping early on but you as you get to about episode 4 you realise they're not developing any story lines and keep going off on boring tangents. Pacing is bad , it's just all round bad."
Why am I watching this stupid show?,"This show started out okay. Not great by any stretch of the imagination. I am now on episode 4 episodes and this show is absolutely ridiculous. I am curious to see what happens so will probably speed watch the rest but I am not really enjoying it.The dialog is awful. Lewis deserves a Razzie award for her performance. Yikes.The mechanic guy, Adam, is really easy on the eye so I enjoy his scenes. Sadly, that shallow observation is about the nicest thing I can say about this show at this point."
DISTASTEFUL. IRRITABLE. AND IRRELEVANT. I AM AMAZED AT HOW ANNOYING THIS IS.,Not one single likable character or actress. They are all distasteful and uninteresting. How did such a foul and irritable show become made? And how did such actors/actresses get cast? There is nothing original or new. Garbage! Absolutely garbage. Yet so much praise.. am really confused. Is it me or are shows getting worse and worse and how did characters become so unlikable?
Seriously ? So much Food in the Wilderness. Why resort to Cannibalism ?,"Pure BS. Seemed like brain cells were damaged in the process of creating the script. Weren't there any thoughts that there are an abundance of food resources in the wilderness?Another survivalist movie that is pure nonsense for the generation that has no idea how to even change a light bulb in their home.With current misinformation agendas, I'm not surprised by today's narratives and programming. Whatever happened to our human spirit, even today's films are echoing its slow demise of the initiative to survive in dire situations.No wonder our new generation is doomed to fail even without a plane crash to motivate them."
Even the pilot is a grind,"I had to fight just to get through the pilot, I'm really trying but try as I may, I can't seem to find any reason what so ever for the good reviews and rating the show has. It's not that it's bad, it's just so boring and bland that I'm struggling just to stay focused on the show.... yikes."
No thanks,"I see teens. I turn it off. Also, episode 1 sucked. Tired of teeny bopper dramas where something serious happened. Teens are exhausting to watch, well at least the Hollywood version are."
Garbage,"I guess HBO thinks adults like to watch kids have sex. No plot, terrible acting, boring and a waste of time. Just watch Alive. There is nothing original about this show. We're supposed to believe that a group of girls who got on a plane for a soccer match also packed their hunting knives and suddenly knew how to make pelts? Trash."
Total trash show rips other books and shows.,"This show is all female cast of Lord of the Files only did that to even be up for any awards. I watched about 20mins of pilot and it was sad. Only 2 well known members of the kids cast the adult are all has been. I never liked showtime shows but this is over produced bad writing. This show is full of wrongs like girls soccer really i live on east coast was in school in 90s girls soccer was not that big it was track and field, field hocky,lacrosse. The writer looked at top girls sports 2021 pop got soccer. This show flip flops all over time the pilot should be a start to what is happening but it is so all over place you cant even get into show. Lets talk now about the critcs on rotten tomatoes they must have been paid being no way it could get a perfect score read watcher reviews and you will see that this show it total garbage. I give it 5 👎...."
total lack of credibility,No one has ever bothered to light a signal fire? An airplane black box that can be destroyed by banging it twice against a rock?...a grizzly bear (in Ontario!?!?) that is killed with one stab of a knife? Magic mushrooms that turn everyone into homicidal maniacs? A younger brother that the writers keep forgetting is part of the cast?
I feel cheated that I wasted time on this,"I'm on episode 7 and there has only just started to be something happening in this right at the end. I thought it was only 8 episodes long but I'm very sad to say it can't be unless they cram everything into the last episode. I'm too invested in it now to stop watching though, but I'm annoyed that I have wasted nearly 7 hours of my life on it so far! They have dragged out the storyline so much & with the switching back & forward to the really boring present day where nothing is happening, it's taking too long to see what's happening. I do think that I have figured it out though but won't put any spoilers. If I'm right I guessed it in the 2nd episode. It reminds me of Lost or Manifest that just went on & on & was quite boring. I will watch the last few episodes & then I will update this if I change my mind from saying that you shouldn't waste your time on it."
Can't watch it anymore,"It's all a silly girl power drama without any sense. Girls in the wild looking fine and great hair and clean clothes. Nonsense. I was hoping for something better, maybe some naive teen girls would find this appealing."
A show with superficially boosted rating it does not deserve,"With a classic suspenseful opening, the show was promising until around the middle. Then it started to struggle. In order to entertain audiences, a lot of side plots and twists were introduced and at around episode 9 I began to think the finale would be great, as everything would come together. Imagine my surprise when episode 10 not only did not tie anything, but introduced a couple more twists, completely sucked out of one's thumb. I mean, who needed this? There was already material for *at least* another season just the way it was. Why would you throw another ton of unnecessary twists out of the blue, just to make sure there is enough controversy no one really needed, while leaving at least 5 burning plot holes unpatched?"
I wish we could give negative scores,"Not only is this extremely politically biased but in addition it's also terrible.The sound design is all over the place and the first three episodes feel like some sort of student project.The only thing they got right was the continuity between the actors as they age which is not exactly an award-winning achievementIf you want to watch some really interesting and mysterious thriller, I can recommend ""from"" instead with far more action packed. Yellow jackets feel like they had no clue where they were going with that story and still don't by season 2.A disaster in every way imaginable. Holy weird strikes again."
What a let down,"Started well and went down hill from second episode. Nonsensical and illogical twists, full of holes and stupid reactions. Wasted 10h of my life. I really recommend you to rather focus on the OST this is the best you can have from this show that will of course get a second season."
Can't bear any more,"Managed to stick it for 4 episodes as it looked intriguing and the reviews on here calouldnt be wrong....could they?I must have watched a different show to the '10s' on here, It's a 5 for me at the absolute best, and that's probably generous.For a show that is supposed to be grounded in reality it treats the viewer as a dumb child. I cannot bear being treated as stupid by shows like this, expecting us not to question all the ridiculous goings on , plot holes, cheesy dialog, lazy writing and terrible sets.Oh look a cabin right next to the plane crash. How convenient . Oh it's all dusty and decayed. Next shot , wow that cabin sure cleaned up nice, all the interior wood looks like new now. Oh and everyone has endless supplies of nice crisp clean clothes. And beds. And pillows. And are master hunters. And flight recorder destroyers, and Axe conjurers. The list just goes on.I can suspend belief when a show doesn't attempt to be grounded in reality , but when it is , don't treat us like mugs with lazy, unresearched writing and plots.I mean why was that girl trying to scrub off a deep engraving in the wooden floor with a cloth??? It's comical how bad some of this is .Oh and some random blobs of wax on the floor are supposed to make a symbol ? Loool I could have connected those dots into any shape you wanted ....absolutely dumb writing that treats the viewer as a fool.So disappointed."
The Pacing Sucks,It's like Lost all over again. People get trapped in the middle of nowhere but instead of focusing on that half the runtime is dedicated to their boring lives back in civilization.
Almost Impressive How Pointless and Dull This Is Given The Premise,"Where to begin.... So the show really hooks you in with an exciting opening up in the mountains, let's just say a young girl is having a very bad day, then that's pretty much the last interesting thing to happen until the very last episode of the season.This show just kind of meanders slowly and pointlessly through the 4 main characters lives as adults, while teasing small snippets of their lives after crash landing on the mountain as teens but always cutting away back to their lives as boring adults before anything interesting happens. There's a bunch of super uninteresting sub plots with all main characters, there's some random violent imagery for shock value but ultimately nothing that ever pushes the plot forward... Just skip this one, I'm not even joking it does barely anything at all until the very last episode.Side note that I have to add: I could not stop laughing during the last episode when one of the main characters passed away after falling asleep outside and just not waking up when it started to snow... I know, I know, hypothermia makes you tired but she could have gone back inside at anytime... Who willfully falls asleep outside just for the sake of the drama of being found dead? Like this show is so dumb and disorganized, it truly was a waste of 9 hours for me."
Bad script and bad acting,"When the acting is bad, it's really hard to get into a series or a movie. It's too unbelievable and fake to me. I couldn't even finish the first episode. I won't be wasting my time watching any more."
Booring,"Had a good start but now nothing ever happens, you have to wait for the end of each episode where something happens.Couldve been a 1 season movies but will turn into a 10 season one."
Don't waste your time,"Boring. Lacking any really connection between scenes, vague, not captivating. The closeups of people eating is also disgusting. I thought with the cast it would be more interesting. Could barely stay interested for longer than 3-5 min at a time."
What a waste of time!,This went all over the place. Poor writing. I will NOT waste time every week watching this. I'll just wait until they have the marathon day at the season finale to watch and see if it actually goes anywhere or makes any sense.
"Lurid, mean, and way too long","Christina Ricci and Jenny Lewis carry this entire ill-conceived series on the backs of their respective (massive) talents, but that doesn't mean they can make it good.The truth is, this series is lurid, it's grim, it's unreasonably mean (every character has the meanest possible reaction to every plot development, constantly) and totally contrived. It is also *far* too interested in the sex lives of all of our characters when that really has nothing to do with the central mysteries playing out at a glacial pace across the season except make them even slower.This should have been a one-season limited series, not truly having enough meat on its narrative bones to sustain interest much longer than that.If you insist on watching this show, I recommend taking a metaphorical shower after every episode - personally, I would watch something with adults behaving reasonably and treating each other with a baseline element of respect. This crap can rot your brain if you live in it too long."
Not that good,A good idea but not that good of a final product. Biggest disappointment was the horrible acting of Juliette Lewis. She's usually great but horrible in this show.
Don't Waste Your Time.,"Yet Another angsty, past v. Present, millennial and Gen. XYZ feelings-fest that started out with a bang, literally, in the first episode and is, par for the course, dying under its own story-less, talentless weight.Another Showtime Stinker. Five skunks out of five. I suffered through 5 episodes, Showtime. I gave you a chance. Yellowjacket's offers the following:
*Simply abysmal script writing and acting - by sad, dysthymic people who should not be in the entertainment business at all. The people involved with this series clearly don't like people or life, and they think an audience is for THEM to relive every traumatic splinter, hang-nail, or C- grade, or knee-scrape they ever experienced. No one in modern television or movie production can tell a good story anymore...all Yellowjackets does is throw new-age dreck at the viewer by the buckets.*The series makes attempts at suspense that are inane and terribly boring. After 4 episodes, no story exists at all. Apparently some angsty, vacuous script writers can't get out of their own stoned heads, and figure out how to simply tell an interesting story about some girl athletes who managed to survive a plane crash and actually survive for months in the wild. That isn't STORY enough? No sir, we must be regaled by some whiny, self-pitying, coach's kid as he goes on and on about poor him and how he got called ""Flex"" as a nickname in junior high....Yeah. Life's real tough, Flex.*There's not just a bad guy or two that the viewer will dislike; Nope. ALL the characters are totally un-likeable. Even the minor ones. Even the occasional child!* Nothing but wall-to-wall explorations into poor behaviors, selfishness, self-absorption, self-pity, and enough depression for an entire large city.*ZERO positivity in any form whatsoever in any of the episodes - despite the actual fact that the majority of them survived! A flipping PLANE CRASH unscathed.* Even the dialogue for the teenagers is way off, causing total unbelievability of these teen characters lost in a woods. They don't act, talk, or remotely behave like actual teenagers in a scary situation, but more like angry, foul-mouthed, disillusioned, Gen Z'rs who hate their lives, and are sitting in a bar sipping their third-double after a very bad day at work. Inauthentic as heck.Honestly? This series is SO bad, that Showtime needs to fire it's entire staff and crew involved with this sad flop. The two-star rating is only for the interesting premise that lured me in in the first place. Too bad Showtime 'talent' killed it before it had its first breath."
Slow or what!!!,"I really don't understand all these good reviews, maybe we just accept anything these days?Some reviews mention it's slow, well.... 'Yes', it's like watching paint dry.This series could have been much better, by halving the season length. I recently watched nos4a2, that was a much better show, but that only gets 6.6 when I last looked.Basically I gave up on this show at ep8... and I do like Juliette Lewis.Sometimes I can't help to think that some of these are paid appraisals, pushing up the score. My first review was declined???And although it may have elements of Lost, it's definitely nowhere near the good presentation or quality of Lost."
Seriously chaotic un-watchable,"Like trying to listen to jazz. Chaotic bouncing around between now and then who the hell thought this was a good thing!? If anyone states ""are you sure"" again I will explode. How on earth no one thought of fishing!? For real! They are starving and living next to a lake in little cabin that somehow turns into 5 bedroom house where everyone has their privacy when director needs it for some stupid scene or other. Cabin is of course fully stacked with bullets and tools but they never thought of fishing. Also speaking all the time that forest is empty of animals is ridiculous. That thick forest in deep nature with lake and everything and without human settlement near would be full of life and with their unlimited suply of bullets they would be eating like queens and be making dry meat for winter. Also first stupid thing from beginning - they crashed in forest and never thought of making big fire with a lot of green leaves to make smoke and be visible from miles and miles away and from any aircraft flying in even near proximity. Any sane person would even when chilling in cabin spend any free time making and maintaining as big fire as possible because they were many kids in plane and literally all country would be searching for them day and night. Also with big fire and smoke if there is any human in area they would see it and come to examine it so girls wouldn't have to take a risk and try to find help like they did. Also 2 and half man lady is still sitcom level actor. I am sorry to say that and i love to see her and i am happy she is getting some work but i just can't buy any emotion or serious face from her. They tried in Last of us, they tried here but just can't do it. Rest of the cast is also B list but they are watchable usually. They just have little to work with, except overly exaggerated closeups of gore and flesh trying to shock us in cheap way even when cute girls are eating well baked meat they made it look bloody and disgusting. On the other hand after month in the wild with little or no food all girls are always perfectly dressed with clean clothes and hairs and everything. Just so much unbelievable stuff with lame mysteries and plots that go nowhere. Lame show by any means ."
Lower your expectations,"The high score brought about a substantial let down. Some of the acting is way below average... see for yourself. Numerous script contradictions, such as State Champions stated in thecshow as ""Elite athletes"" which is simply ridiculous given they are a drug using, alcohol abusing, backstabbing, bickering, divided group. In one outdoor party scene at a particular camera angle it's raining but at the same time from the next angle its a fine clear night.The plane crash... as the plane is almost at ground level, all the passengers are sucking oxygen from masks. Rather unnecessary.The worst part is the poor acting. Second worst are the totally contrived dramas in some scenarios."
"Season started strong, but ended badly","I actually really liked this show up until the last two episodes of the season, the season finale being the worst episode. The show started tarted off strong, but the amount of truly unrealistic things going on became too distracting, such as the young Yellowjackets looking way too clean, sane, happy, and with an absurd amount of outfits, considering they were only supposed to be at their destination for a week and are supposedly ""starving"" in the wilderness. I think the wardrobe department could have done a better job of portraying true survivalism and not just a bunch of teenagers camping. Cutting up animals as if they've been doing it their whole lives. Also, the fact that someone could get by with getting their leg amputated or getting their face mauled by a wolf without access to antibiotics or proper medical care is just so stupid.The last episode was just absurd, with adult Shauna all of a sudden being a total sociopath who is casually sawing somebody up who only a day before was her lover, as if being out in the wilderness makes you a wacked out serial killer, same with Misty, how many people has she killed in her day? I didn't think that was appropriate for Shauna's character, like the writing and acting of the last episode was so off the mark... And we're also to believe that Jackie froze overnight when just the night before they were traipsing around in spaghetti strap dresses? She wouldn't have tried to get back in, and why did they kick her out in the first place? Cruelty just for cruelty's sake. Anyways, the show had potential but by the last episode of the season, I completely lost interest because of of absurd it got."
Lord of the flies rip off,"Mostly about teenage girl angst, girl/women power via flashbacks. Doesnt get tonthe point until the end. What a waste. If you were looking for mystery like lost etc skipp this failed monstrosity."
Boring and uninteresting!,"The first episode was a bit ok. After that, there was that scenario like abc, cbs, like lost and other stuff like that.I don't want to reveal anything from the action of the series, but I can only say this: in critical situations, like this, some teenagers cannot behave as the ""heroes"" of this show do. Everything is ""calculated"", ""unrealistic"". I'm sorry but I really lost my temper watching the second episode. It is not at all captivating, the action takes you back and forth in time, every 2-3 minutes. Even the sinner has a decent fluency compared to this typical and so boring series.Only the soundtrack can save it!"
"Well-made for what it is, but","Don't expect anything remotely close to realistic.I got intrigued when I read the plotline and the that creators were inspired by the Andes flight disaster in 72.That, along with a pretty impressive lineup of talanted actresses.However, everything becomes over the top pretty quickly and impossible to take seriously. The emotions portrayed at some of the horrific events that unfold are straight up silly.But just because it wasn't what I expected doesn't make it bad! It's an interesting mix of genres and a unique spin on it.The show does a really great job of portraying the different personalties of all the characters."
Boring,Focuses way too much on taissa who's storyline is boring as hell. I've started fast forwarding thru her. Everything else just drags. And still haven't figured out why everyone is so obsessed with Travis. That seems to be all anyone wants to talk about.
"Slow, captivating story - could be better, but decent cast","At the end of each episode, you can reflect knowing that you've gained another 2% of knowledge on what's actually going on. So it can be VERY frustrating has the story hops from past to present with mostly useless drama. However, if you're binge watching it then it's not bad. Like if you have nothing better to do, the characters/actors will keep you going.. and it's captivating enough where you want to know what's happening so you stick with it."
"Though interesting, ultimately too slow and boring","I was really excited to watch this show. I was a fan of Lost and I heard this show was its spiritual successor. I did appreciate some aspects of the series, including the mysterious symbolism and occult aspects of some of the flash backs / characters. That being said, there just wasn't enough for me to justify continuing the show. I completed season 1 and to be honest, it was a slog. The episodes had too much filler and I was clearly more interested in what was going on with the kids on that island compared to anything they were trying to do with the adult characters... and that's half the entire show. The actress who plays the adult Shauna, Melanie Lynskey, gives such a boring and wooden performance. I wasn't interested in her character arc. I thought that this would be the next show that I'd be watching, but honestly, it was too boring to binge. I won't be returning for season 2."
Surviving Tropes and Boredom: A Yellowjacket's Tale,"Embark on a journey where survival instincts and Hollywood tropes collide: men are as useful as a wet matchstick and women are mysteriously adept at overcoming every obstacle.The boys are portrayed as sexist, uncontrollable, aggressive, and sex-crazed, while being push-overs to the main characters. The girls, on the other hand, are stunning, brave, and always right-even when they're wrong.The scenes that stand out and excite are the ones in the wilderness, offering the best meal this show serves up. But beware, the girls brave the wilderness through their cunning use of survival sk-uh-magic. Yep, magic.There's a catch, though: it's like two TV shows running simultaneously. One follows the girls lost in the woods, while the other focuses on the girls grown into women, with the only change in their characters being their age. The women are depicted as narcissistic, shallow psychopaths and this aspect just plays out as boring.The only silver lining was Jackie, and for that I give a 5/10.In summary, it's character development that got lost in the woods and never returned. But aren't all girls great??"
It started out fairly well,But it has slowly degenerated as the episodes have worn on. If not for Christina Ricci's character I would have tuned out a long time ago. She is the only thing likely to keep me to the finish line. By episode 5 it becomes an angst filled whine fest.
Flashbacks,"I'm happy I gave it a chance, just to find out how overrated it is! Present day storyline is so boring that I just watched the flashbacks. It could have been so better if it was a single season containing just the flashbacks and it had a proper ending. I bingewatched it waiting for a mind-bending ending but that also did not happen. Another thing is that it was not obvious if it was all about Shauna or not. Like you keep revolving around her trauma and her past and her talking to Jackie after death and her hallucinations but she is still NOT the main character! I mean come on make it clear are we here for them all or just for Shauna? If it was to be about all the survivors it literally failed, because most of the time, whether or not intentional, it was Shauna's point of view on everything."
A rewrinting-cocktail of already told stories.,"Great cast, but apart from being hyper predictable, there is nothing new in it, or at least not in the part where they get stranded in the wilderness. Get the real tragedy already told in ""Viven"", add three quarters of the craziness of ""The lord of the flies"", but don't turn most characters into girls (because Hollywood needs to compensate so much male domination in and out of fiction), shake it and serve it extremely cold with a bit of ""Murder she wrote"" and ""Nine perfect strangers"" on the side.The best: Christina Ricci & Elijah Wood.The worst: the whole ""couch"" story line and behaviour.It is fun to watch but, you just know everything is going to happen, well, almost. There was one death that I found particularly surprising but totally unnecessary and that transform the whole series in a comedy."
Not that good,"Let's be honest, episode were dragged out to the max and I lose interest after the second episode. The acting was good other than that it was an mediocre start."
They could have done it better.,"Season one should have been the preservative of the teenage versions of themselves meanwhile season two could have been older them. The flashbacks and flash forwards are kind of annoying. I would have liked it better in the style of The 100, watching how the girls survived all of it not just glimpses. Otherwise it would have been a much better show and they would have captured a younger audience."
Struggling 5,"The people rating this show must be either on crack or teenagers. Or teens on crack.Not even worth my time to remark on the storyline, writing or acting."
"maybe interesting for young teen girls, else just garbage","It is really bad and full of clichés. The girls behave like cliché teen girls and everything else is just really bad scripted. This pseudo ""we are a football team"" nonsense, then this one girl that doesn't fit in the ""captain"" role at all, pseudo pep talks just really so bad.Example, coach tells one girl ""only reason you are the captain is because you have influence"". She is literally the least influential person in the team. Just ridiculous.Might be interesting for girls, but for me, a 28 year old guy, nope, i just get aggressive of all the stupidity watching this."
It reminds me of the endless Lost tv show,"First episode ok, second acceptable and from there let's go to boredom as nothing happens and switch from past to future like ""LOST"" with useless conversations for episodes and episodes.You think something comes but never does, I will finish the season but it will likely be empty as hell. As IMDB already says there is gone be a season 2 , I know already nothing will happen, or not enough to keep me watching."
"Please, dont waste your time.","If you watched the trailer, you know this was SUPPOSED to be about survival and cannabalism. Sadly, this does NOT deliver. Not an ounce of cannabilism.The reviews all over the internet are 100% botted.The only reason this show deserves 3 stars remotely is because the acting is kind of strong when it comes to some adults.The kid acting is campy and half of them i'm not sure are good actors. Sure, the're a few but it doesnt make up for this big plotless mess of a tv show. Its premise is grounded enough, but someone they managed to make it ridiculous.My main problem is they didnt deliver on their promises, but even if they did, this show would be FAR from perfect. I wouldnt reccomend a watch at ALL. It is a huge letdown."
"EXTREMELY BORING, IMPOSSIBLY SLOW, VERY MISLEADING TRAILER, AND LAZY WRITING","The trailer made it out like it would be a fast paced tv series, but it is impossibly slow, and it doesn't make you care for the characters at all, as they constantly do things that are very hard to believe.Far fetched doesn't even begin to cover it.For example, SPOILER ALERT, in episode 8, why would they set fire to a girl that had been mauled by a wolf, without checking that she was really dead?So many plot holes it is literally unbelievable.The whole show is so preposterous."
Best production value but possibly worst story development of any Stranded-teens TV series.,"Proves that just because you are a show about 'exciting' things (plane crash, wilderness survival, being stalked, investigating murder) doesn't mean you will be an exciting watch...Starting with some positives: This show has the best post-rescue/back in society segments compared to the handful of other stranded-teen shows. The casting was mostly great, matching the younger to older versions of the characters.The writing does deliver on some decent laughs but overall it feels shallow and the pacing is crawling SLOW. The show seems to be setting up more and more screen time for the present day timeline in the season(s) to come, but still hasn't shown us anything great in the stranded timeline.Writers went wayyy too heavy on pre-crash drama & too light on any gritty survivalism that would be required to survive as long as they supposedly did. The survivalism overall, including the interaction with environment & animals, is very inaccurately done.Worst problem is overall story arc getting practically nowhere. So slow it feels like this pace will take 3 more seasons to wrap up everything they've started but kept hanging.The finale failed, miserably, to impress, lost 1 Star for that alone. Later seasons need to really ramp up the reveals/action/realism to get an above average rating and prove season 1 wasn't a waste of time..."
Overrated,"I watched all episodes cause of the great reviews. I will get to the point Ep1 & 2 Boring. Gets interesting from EP3 than goes boring again in between EP5-8. To much flash back and forward crap. Leaves more questions then answer's. Completely overrated. Silly in some parts as don't make any sense at all. You need to realise that the kids don't have no antibiotics at all. What happen to the young boy? Wasted my whole day for this crap, don't really care about season 2. Rather watch something that has an answer not to many sub plots. On the positive note there are good meaning's through out the movie (Just be nice to one another)."
It was going so well until it wasn't,"I was really enjoying this until the final episode. Nine episodes of decent plot and subplots, character development, acting, etc.Then nothing! A minor character throughout the series suddenly becomes the key to what's going to happen next, and then it just ends.It's all just been a buildup to what will presumably season two.Nothing resolves. Nothing.It's just a lazy ending and you feel that your time has been washed."
A show about middle-aged women nagging,"If you're a middle aged woman with childhood, dating and or marital problems than this movie is for you. The only interesting bits of this movie are the flash back scenes that annoying jump back and fourth. I wish they just made the flashbacks into one long clip and turned it into another series. Then take all the non flash back scenes and made it a different series because this show punishes you for watching it. Constantly switching between the good action and house wife drama/middle aged woman drama.It's clear this show was written for women because every man is a villain or inept. All the women are sympathetic characters even when they're completely in the wrong. There's one couple I truly loathe watching when they appear and that's the lesbian couple and their future serial killer son (where is the boys father?). The most boring banter/side story in the entire series revolves around every scene involving them. I actually gave up and started fast forwarding through all their scenes after episode 6.The other couple the boring house wife and her inept equally boring husband with their beochy daughter. There's nothing more exciting than somebodies Lifetime drama marital problems.Each episode is an hour long I think. Feels like every episode is 3 hours long though. It's slow and the dull scenes last way too long. Can't imagine a more boring idea for a show than one that revolves around middle aged women and their problems. It's like being trapped inside Kohls at 4pm on a weekday.----------------------UPDATE!--------------------------I continued on to finish this show and WOW was I wrong this is a great! Exciting show! Just kidding. It literally made me drop the rating I originally gave it. This show just gets worse and worse. It's like at the production meeting they took everyone's ideas and put them all in a hat and then just decided on using everyone's ideas and not picking a single one to stick with.You want teen drama? We got that! Want baby drama? We got that! Lesbian drama? We got that! Junkie drama? We got that! Marital drama? We got that! Broken middle aged women? We got that! Crazy religious girl? We got that!, Crazy cat lady? We got that! (we gave her a bird instead to make it new and fresh! Though) but wait there's more! We forgot to make a male character gay! Now we got that! We need to spice it up with the supernatural and have a psychic that sees not only dead people BUT the future too! Now We got that!What? One person seeing dead people not enough? Well we'll add in someone who sees both ghost AND sleepwalks AND morphs into a crazy person when they do! How do you like that!?But wait there's more!Let's also throw in a detective! A murder mystery! And... dunn dunn dunn a cliff hanger season finally! Yaaaaaay!!!!!!!!This series is a cluster bomb of suck. The ONLY good thing in this entire show is Christina Ricci. She makes it worth watching. All of her scenes make the show tolerable. I have to admit that Juliette Lewis seemed so miscast for her role that it was distracting. She'd be great if this were a standalone movie but playing the older version of a young,beautiful and talented actress just wasn't buying it for me. Unless you have a role with a character that needs to constantly be overly dramatic she's just not a good fit."
You are being programmed to eat a human.,"Sick shows that uses a subtile mechanism to turn cannibalism into a positive and socially accepted light. You like your neighbour so much that you want to eat them, sure you have the green light to do so. How low and sick does it have to get until people realise how they are being played and manipulated? But some of them are just consuming every sick show that is thrown at them and they loved it after being previously hypnotised by other brutal and violent shows."
Stupid and boring!,"I watched the 1st season when it came out (mainly because I was Juliette Lewis fan, in the 90s) and thought it was ok, not Great, aggravating that they never got to what they really did in the woods all season and the older versions of the characters were kinda boring to me, their storyline and what not, except for misty, now this 2nd season, is real bad, feels like it's trying to be funny at times and it's not, misty went from quirky, to super annoying, as is Elijah Woods character, I feel like it's one big, stupid endorsement for cannibalism. I really don't wanna see them eating people (especially their dead friends) every episode. It's too much. We get it they ate people, we already knew that before they showed it! Melanie Lynsky, is so boring, sure she's a good actress but she's boring, all of it is boring and really dumb now. I had to forward thru most of season 2, episode 2 & 3, also theres not really any characters to root for & imo, none are very likable. I'm done with it, just left a bad taste in my mouth ironically!"
Too Predictable. Pointless Plot Riddled with Holes.,"You can pretty much predict the entire story with just these 4 phrases: high school girls, shock value, deserted island, shrooms. There are only a few possibilities given those terms and you have now guessed what this is about.The show goes back and forth between their time on the island and future events as adults. The trauma they suffered carried over and because there isnt a single working neuron between all of them (yes that includes misty and the politician... both dumb as knobs), you can imagine the possible events.I found the characters down right boring. In a lot of ways this is like The Boys, which has a similar target audience (immature adults with low IQ). The entire show depends on shock factor to keep your attention and when that doesnt work, lets sprinkle in some sex. Its so boring.The events that took place are riddled with plot holes as well. For instance, you want to know someones background so what do you do? 1st thing any person would think of is pull a $20 background check right? Nope... not these people. They will google them and if they dont see anything there, its panic time because as you know, everyone is on the internet right? (lol).Next, you are out in a jungle somewhere and you are low on food, so what do you do? Hunt and gather right? Well its a group of about 10 girls and 3 guys... and yet only 2 go out for food and half the time they spend boinking. The others were just waiting around to die of hunger while they washed bloody rags because their mincies (did I spell that right?) synced. I am not even kidding... that happened.I will say this however. Its better than Lost because... well everything is better than Lost. I do think that there might be potential here but the writing... oof its so bad."
"Transparent Plot and Unlikable Characters, unfortunately.","This show suffers from a very common problem in shows nowadays, which is this: Not a SINGLE ONE of these characters is the least bit LIKABLE!The main character here (Shauna?) is so blah and dull and lacking in energy and personality, it's a chore to watch her. Plus, in the 2021 ""version"" of her life, her daughter treats her like total garbage, and the woman just allows this...plus, she kills something in her garden which totally turned me off, right from the start.We have other characters, like Christina Ricci's character Misty. We discover she is a pretty awful person as well, when we see how she treats an older woman who is sick in bed.Then we have Juliette Lewis. Normally, I enjoy her acting. In this story, however, her character is totally bland. Plus, she looks nothing like her ""younger character,"" so that's just weird and makes no sense.I'm confused as to why these girls are on the airplane. Did I fall asleep and miss something crucial? I'm guessing they're playing another soccer team somewhere, but why are those boys with them? I don't know. And the worst part is, I don't really care!Yes, I can guess what's going to happen after The Crash. Some ""Lord of the Rings"" cannibalistic scenario with creepy costumes will ensue.The thing is, in order to actually ""care"" what happens to these people, you should at least like some of them. At least one of them, maybe? And I just don't! And the stupid sex stuff they toss in doesn't make everything more interesting, sorry.I can see how some people might enjoy this...if they're bored and have nothing else to do. But honestly, I don't have a real desire to continue watching, and that's not a sign of a good show."
very disappointing,"1 star because I like a lot of the music. 1 star for Ricci and Lynskey. 1 star because there's one cute guy in it for a while. Took that away because it wasn't really deserved. There's only so long and so far I can suspend disbelief, and watch a show that mostly moves at a glacial pace. Plot holes abound. Puerile nonsense for the most part. Kept trying until halfway through episode 8 as my friend wanted to discuss the series with me, but I couldn't waste any more of my time. Oh I have to write more, but I don't want to include spoilers! So what I'll say is that I will watch Better Call Saul again a few more times rather than this tripe."
So Many Useless Story Lines and Scenes,"Why all the masturbation? It adds nothing to the plot or to the characters development. I would love that time to be filled with something more important or interesting. Why go through and show the middle-aged couple's sexual fantasies? Does not add anything to the plot. This would be so much better if they just had focused on the plane crash. Plenty of story could have been told there that was not. I would have much rather seen the victims of this crash than watching the 40-something people and all their problems that I don't care about. In one scene a decent looking guy is rear-ended by one of the 40-somethings... she is overweight and although for 40, she is not bad looking, she is certainly not anyone a man like that would EVER ask out or flirt with, yet he pursues her. It... makes... no ... sense. That also added nothing to the plot at all. It also goes a bit ""woke"" sometimes, which seriously takes away from the plot. Showrunners need to start focusing more on plot and character development and less on checking boxes and putting in messaging... like in one scene, the gay spouse is concerned with their child in school... and the other spouse replies that no matter how bad it is that we must ""Support the public schools."" So, she is willing to sacrifice her child's education for politics... What does that have to do with a plane crash? And no... we should never support schools that fail our children. We should each ensure that all children get a good education, regardless of politics.The premise and idea of the story could have been really good. We need to get the politics and messaging out of our TV."
Heavily borrowed,"There's nothing new here. Heavily borrowed Alive (1993) then the list runs long - Blair Witch Project, I Know What You Did Last Summer, Sixth Sense and whatever else. Also not new is the lecturing on sexism, patriarchy and racism. The worse bit is not even the back and forth flashbacks of two plotlines but the marital breakdown/affair, a murder, a blackmail, political ambitions, a disturbed child - if I haven't left anything out - are all thrown in there.The three stars are for the storyline of the adults - Ricci, Lewis, Lynskey and Cypress who deserve more screen time. The younger actors are good but with the ridiculous loopholes in their part of storyline, they are out of their depth, struggling to make it believeable.For one, how did the writers think a bunch of crash survivors could be stranded out in the wilderness for 19 months? Strange that there were no sounds of helicopter whirring around in the first week or so, especially given that Lottie's (Eaton) dad hired the private plane and also the plane was on fire, there would be smoke seen for miles. That's just crazy plot even for the sprawling Canadian Rockies, we're not talking the ocean here or a remote island in the South Pacific. But gore, sex and the scare factor are top priorities in this series. It could all be done very well but each episode is more convoluted than the previous one.If the next season improves, it will be because the writers stop trying too hard to be edgy and stick to one or two storylines. They just have to remember that simple is good."
Are we watching LOST x a bit of GOT?,"Are we watching LOST x a bit of Game of Thrones?What the F with the ghosts and the visions and the fire?The first 2 episodes were good, then they went into an unrealistic fantasy directionAlso, if we are going at this pace, are they expecting 13 seasons like the walking dead? I am quitting this now because it's BS. The writers are too ambitious and aiming for too high."
What a load of steaming manure.,"Season 1 started off with intrigue and a good story. Then, as with most everything else Hollywood spews forth of late, it descends into a drawn out, hobbling, badly written assembly of sub-plots and irrelevant mush come season 2. To say I am disappointed would be an understatement, but I suppose Hollywood does whatever it can these days to get the eyeballs and draw out a story for as long as it possibly can. What I see happening here is very similar to what happened with Lost, way back when TV became more about binge watching than delivering a story that is actually crafted with intelligent humans as the target audience."
A great storyline but fell well short,"I won't give you all the fancy critique words but after watching 2 episodes I'm out!!!What i believed was going to be a good story line with hints of the well known Andes survival story, Lord of the Flies etc just fell way way short of anything decent.Cheesy, corny, low budget, C grade immature college culture and just not believable...,,
if you get to the woefully unrealistic plane crash scene in E2 you did well and know what I mean.If you want to waste your life on this stuff good on you and don't forget to give yourself an uppercut while you are there.Harsh I know but don't waste your Saturday night on this lot."
More of the same,Everything here has been done before. Some sex on the first chapter is no original way of getting the viewers attention.The back and forth on time is kind of annoying and has been done before so many times in movies and tv shows.I lost interest in the very first episode but watched the second one. And before the end of the episode I was pressing the pause button and looking for something else.
overrated,"I've seen few episodes, 5, 6, don't remember. It seems like it has a good premise, it seems like it could be something, but it boils down to story about lame housewives who all distrust each other but are forced to spend time together. I don't know who would care to watch that.But, I've seen multiple people who are supposed to be cultured, sing praises about this telenovela. And now looking here, it has a rating of almost 8! I have no idea what anyone could connect to in this, it's a complete failure to use really good premise, to tell really engaging story, it's just boring and flat, and characters are off puttingAlso, the age difference between some actresses who are supposed to be older versions of same generation teens who experienced something decades ago, is glaring and pulls you even further out of the experienceit's just all around bad show that for some reason has high rating, but really doesn't deserve it."
Nothing happens,"The first minute shows a girl running through a forest then falling on spikes in a trap , pulled out , had her throat slit and the other people who are dressed up eating her l that's the last time you will see or hear about it in the whole series , we kept watching as we thought it would be some sort of lord of the flies scenario but all that happens is a slow stupid boring story of middle aged women looking back at 18 months of their lives when they were trapped after a plane crash , what happened to the people dressed in bearskins eating people l I realise it's set up for a second series but after wasting hours and hours on the first we definitely won't be watching."
Disgusting,"Really, the behavior of the teens is horrible even before they crash. What reactions are you trying to get from viewers. Bottom of the barrel premise."
"Sex, sex, sex and no story.","First episode, five minutes in, and two bouts of sex. Sorry, need a little more than cheap tactics to intrigue me. Deleted all episodes and won't be going back. I had high hopes but I felt like I needed a shower and could not care less who died, or how or why."
I want to like it.. but,"So much potential. Acting is good, it's just the probably the small things that make you suspend belief, and I feel like it's a production issue or a director? For me I knew I wouldn't watch season two but would finish off the first season was when the girls face got eaten by a wolf, horrifically disfigured, but A Mere two episodes later she has instead a scar on her face instead of a half eaten face. It just feels when TV shows or movies do this kind of trope it's insulting to the viewer because they obviously think the audience is stupid enough to notice and not ask questions.Also the episode where they have the prom, they've just survived a plane crash nearly been killed multiple times but hey they are American girls and nothing is gonna stop them from having a prom. It's just so cringeworthy and these are the examples that happen throughout the TV show that which is expected to go along with to me and over looking the glaring flaws. To me it sounds like lazy storytelling on the writers part. Other than these things, it isn't a bad show the acting is good. I watched the rest of the season, but I won't be returning for season two."
poorly written poorly acted terrible cast,With the amount of fur and horns etc etc etc they wear i find cannibalism to be quite a stretch......and that is just 1 example of the many holes in this.
Soooo slow,Omg this show is painful. It's so slow. There is no suspense where one episode finishes you just have to watch the next one. Even so I preserved because the beginning of the whole shoe teases something worth watching is coming. But it's so slow getting to that you have moments of wondering why you are still watching. Great cast. Terrible writing.
Slow,"I don't know if this is considered a spoiler but I marked it just in case.I really wanted to like this series. The trailer and first episode made me want to know more. Unfortunately, after just finishing the last episode we still know NOTHING! I get it they want to drag it out to make more season but come on! We waited 10 weeks to not know what happened in the woods!"
Lord of the Flies but zzzzzzz,Great if you love a show that is 2 minutes dialog and 5 minutes of music after every scene. Gets pretty annoying.Not only that but after the crash there is like 15 people but they appear and disappear so frequently.In 2001 there was a movie called The Hole. The one character hides the key to get out just do she can stay around her crush while killing her best friend and others dying. The one character smashing the box reminded me of that movie. Also how did no one hear her banging loudly on this metal box in the woods? At this point though they would have already recorded their location.I think it's hilarious that these girls with ZERO hunting skills are running around in pelts from animals killed. I've watched Alone and they are skilled survivors and they couldn't do that.I turn this off. If I'm going to watch a show about a plane and people on an island who crashed I'm going to watch Lost. Way better character development.
Episode 2 was enough to know not to bother,Utter nonsense. The writers obviously didn't research the Andes crash. A Porsches battery cable is removed but you hear the starter motor turn the engine twice- not possible. Black boxes are designed to survive a crash and can't be opened up by a teenage girl. That single piece of bad writing allows this farce to commence. The lead follows her husband suspecting hes having an affair but doesnt confront him when she sees him with another woman. A dried out dead body sitting in a chair in the attic - it would need to be tied there but wasn't. Travis hanging at his work. He or a mannequin is obviously wearing a harness that the chain rope is attached to as its not around his neck.
I think I'll pass,I really love the cast but this show doesn't seem to live up to the hype. Two episodes in and we learn that one of the characters destroyed the black box so these people will be left stranded. Such an incredibly dumb plot twist. This is definitely leading to cannibalism. Next.
Why the bad reviews?,"That's what I thought when I started watching this show.I liked the cast, the premise, the way it was set up.I thought wrong.It took me a couple of years to get as far as watching it - because many of the reviews sounded so bad.And in most cases, the negative reviews are the ones to read, as they usually are the honest ones.Unless it's a fan cult thing; comments such as it's not like the book written by some obsure SciFi hack, that star wars character should not have a haircut different from what it was in the original garbage filmed in the 80s; in that case most reviews are nonsense.But I digress.I was intruiged initially, only to realize a few episodes in that the story wasn't going anywhere.Just like this posting, it struggled to meet it's minimum character limit, and apart from that produced nothing but aimless and meaningless filler material.It's a tease, promising to deliver, but as usual you get less the longer you stick with it.Avoid."
Too ambitious.,"Just finished the second episode and everything is still so unclear. Looks like nothing has developed since the begging but the story itself keeps falling a part. The plot is trying to be so ambitious but as for now that's seems like nothing thrilling either important stands behind that. However, it might change in future episodes. As for now, it's solid 3 which is not must watch for sure."
only three episodes in but nothing is keeping me,This show sounded wicked cool when i heard about it and so i tried it and it starts out pretty cool. The 90s indie music gives the 90s scenes a good aesthetic and i enjoyed that but so far the adult part of the story is so so boring. I like all the actresses but their plots are boring me and the world in which they live don't feel lived in. I might stick w it but idk.
It's ok,"I really like shows/movies with a survival premise- I loved The WILDS!! I just finished watching the amazing HANNA so I was a need of a new show... It's not that this is a bad show but I feel like it missed the mark.The cast is pretty talented and the scenes with Juliette Lewis and Christina Ricci are my favorite. The show moves very slooowly. The survival stuff is good and interesting but there's not enough of it. I'm assuming they're trying to drag it out for a season 2(3 and 4).The downfall for me is that the show takes away a lot of suspense when we basically already know who lived and who died. The pacing is weird too. For instance: we as an audience didn't even get to know ""Travis"" or see his relationship with ""Misty"" until after his death as an adult!Another downfall is that the character of ""Shauna"" (both teen and adult) is SO unlikable, selfish and manipulative that I just don't want to watch her at all and that character gets waaay too much screen time. Poor Jackie! :(
Just give us more scenes with Christina Ricci!!"
Really disappointing,"Casting is awful, the story is very weak. The directing is poor. I'm surprised this series exists. I like Juliette Lewis, but I don't like this role for her. Christina Ricci is probably the best character. One of the main characters is annoying and kinda ruins it for me. I expected to be wowed by the end of the first season, but it fell flat. The whole build up was good, but it just went nowhere. I put it on to fall asleep because I know I won't miss any decent content. I could probably rewrite this better and more meaningful. I thought fluff pieces died before the sopranos. Yellow jackets is a waste of actor talent, and every other industry talent. I think it started with the terrible writing."
Incredibly disappointing...so much potential...,"This series starts with an intriguing plot. The soccer team, stuck in the woods, survives via cannibalism and tribal warfare.Then it goes back to the present time (or whenever 25 years after the plane crash was)...just bad acting, poorly crafted story and complete boredom. This show makes you want to like it and then comes to a standstill...maybe you stick around for episode 2...get right to another interesting part...boom...stand still. By the time you get to episode four you're almost watching it just because you've already put in 3 hours of time.The good parts of this show are a moot point because they are farrrrr over ridden by the tedium. It seeks like they didn't have enough content to actually make an entire series, and the show should have been a movie...or a 4 part mini-series (kind of like ""the patient"" with Steve Carell).After season 1, I won't be returning for season 2. My ""sustained viewing guilt"" has far passed.In summery, HGG HMMMM (throat clear), some girls get into what seems like an interesting situation, but most of what we see are their boring lives 25 years after anything interesting happened. Sadly, it is very much like real life...in that interesting things only happen to us in like, doctor's offices or some ish.Save yourself sometime, drive to a restaurant you love on a day it isn't open...feel the disappointment...then go home and eat your meal pepper chicken breast."
Not gripping enough for me,"Started watching YellowJackets with high hopes but unfortunately it's just wasn't for me. It's not gripping and it's not very realistic with its acting either albeit a great cast. There no real connection with any characters and overall just fairly boring. Unsure how it received 8.0.Also I'm fairly sure if was 16 in a plane crash in the middle of a forest I'd actually shed a few tears, not this lot who just ran around screaming and taking pills."
Dissapointed,"I have a feeling I watched completely different series than other people who are rating it. I love the acting of most of the actresses. But the story is so illogical and weak. At the beggining of first season it sets you up with some scenes that are not even in the first season. It was very dissapointing because it promised to be good survival story and somewhat horrory, meanwhile almost every death or injury in the wilderness would be completely preventable if they used their brain. I dont think I will be watching 2. Season. If i wasnt sick in bed this week I wouldnt even finish the first one."
"""We hate Ted Lasso so we made this show""","Terrible reason to make show, horrible mindset of creation. Overall it's just the b*tch high school cheerleader trying to gain attention when the nerdy band kid does something cool. ""Look at me!! Look at me!!"" 1 star is too high."
Bored to Death,"I tried to watch this and give it a chance. After 5 episodes I'm done. Everything is predictable, and there is no point whatsoever to this nonsense. The acting is decent but really nothing interesting has happened in any of the 5 episodes I watched. I fell asleep during the last one but watched enough of it support a 2 out of 10 star rating."
Great show... if someone else wrote it,"I guarantee you've seen this show before in some kind of variation. The writing is predictable. The pacing is slow.That's not inherently a problem. But, when you add poorly written dialogue and poor acting to a show that's predictable and slowly paced: you get this drab affair.This show is so underwhelming that it can't even make use of its ensemble cast: Christina Ricci, Juliette Lewis, and Melanie Linskey's efforts to raise the stale atmosphere of this supposed-to-be thriller, are all foiled by shallow direction and unimaginative writing.Overall, the shows problem is: these are not characters that you want to know.The show has spent a good amount of time, so far, bringing in characters who are curious about the infamous events of the ladies' past. But it fails to deliver the same level of curiosity to its audience because it doesn't to give you characters to which you can connect.These kinds of shows are tv shows of tv shows. They poorly attempt to write real humans through the lens of television characters.The flashback scenes exacerbate the dullness. None of the young actors give particularly captivating performances. On top of the poor writing, the show quickly collapses into itself.It's an interesting premise and it could've been done well by people who could actually write dynamic characters."
A slog going nowhere fast.,Tedious slow progression with little to like. The first few minutes of the first episode alluded to how wild I imagine the end of the season will probably become. But we are now 6 episodes in with little to show for it. It just keeps going nowhere. Characters are very grating and no one to like or root for. Only committed to finishing the season because I've wasted so much time hoping it'd get interesting.
maybe i'm missing something,"Idk this is exactly what i look for. Lord of the flies, cast away vibes. I can follow any story but this one is all of the place, casting is a little disconnected; especially with Juliet lewis, literally did not know her character till like 3rd episode. Idk seems disjointed, much like The Leftovers. Maybe i don't get it but i was present."
An entire season of nothing,"After seeing the trailer i thought this would be a great show, something new and interesting, but i ended up disappointed.The show starts on a slow pace, very confusing, but that's ok, the problem is that by each episode the viewer ends up with more questions than answers, the whole plot is filled with holes that don't make sense, they had a great opportunity to write something interesting when the characters were in the woods, instead all you get is girl drama, extremely boring situations, and of course, a crashed plane that took of in the middle of the woods (you can't make that stuff up).Basically you can see an entire season and feel like nothing has really happened in the show, the only good thing about this show is Christina Ricci acting."
I only cared about 1/2 of the show,"Half of this show takes place 20 years in the past and the other half takes place in modern day. The past portions are very interesting and really well done. The modern day part is utterly boring though. Also, episode 1 was by far the best episode. It kind of slowly gets less and less interesting each episode after that. Still, it's worth checking out and I still found it okay overall."
Sub par wilds,"I really wanted to like this show, I loved the cast and the plot description but it just fell flat. This show was so slow and spent 80% of the season in the present. I kept waiting for something to happen but it never did. Reminds me a lot of the wilds just not as good."
A show full of dumb or irrational decisions,"Episode after episode I was more confused as to what was supposed to be going on. We hardly ever get any traction on progressing the plot, and the decisions made are often times dumb. Most scenes that take place in the woods are not very believable at all. I understand they're teens but if you're living in the woods with no food, I find it hard to believe that they would be trying to run off and have sex. I only kept watching to see what the point of it was and what actually happened in the woods. By the end I was extremely disappointed."
A dash of everything but originality,"This show is like a love child of everything I've seen the last 30 years. X files, Lost, Blair Witch, Twin Peaks, anything from the CW. Just a buffet of things.Sometimes the show works, sometimes it's just boring, sometimes it's just really odd and disjointed. I get disinterested in the storyline, zone out. Never good for a tv show. Way too many storylines interweaving. The daughter storyline is confusing.The acting is good...sometimes. Other times down right awful. The cinematography is ok, a bit distracting in parts, a lille to artsy in others.Season One. Ok. Better than most Tv. Season Two. Stupid. Very convoluted."
Pilot is awesome but,There's no more element of surprise after episode 2 as u can already know where it's going. I was hoping the suspense dragged a little bit longer but it didn't. Great actors but storyline is Meh. There are many series like these so I'm gonna pass this one out.
Dire,"I felt quite proud of myself that I managed four episodes.This really is set up for little girls well, teenage girls at nestAnnoying characters, ridiculously slow pace and average standard of acting.If you like shows made for children like Stranger Things or Marvel comic movies, this will be right up your street.If you're an adult with a mature, intellectual brain, then this won't be for you.The premise of drawing you in that something has happened in the past goes on and on with no real end in site.If you're a 15 year old American cheerleader, you'll love this.If you're a British adult- steer well clear. Total garbage!"
Just no...,"Plot is hollow, casting a flaw.Anyone with half brain know that women are not dumb the way the series made them look! For a show made by a woman, this is pretty lame.This is Lord of the Flies with something from Ravenous.And the cast (older and younger) have no ressemblance at all!Just a big fail."
Requires complete suspension of disbelief,"I really wanted to like this show, since it featured the charming Melanie Lynskey from 2017s I Dont Feel At Home In This World Anymore, and I had been told it was an adaptation of the famous Golding novel Lord of the Flies (it isn't). To be clear, the USP of the Lord of the Flies is that the characters are all basically children whereas in this series, many of the characters are older and therefore thedyname and subject matter is completely different, in my opinion.In particular, i struggled to buy into the initial episodes where actors are wearing bearskins and other animal skins. Tonally it felt off, and the, actors at times seems to all be vying for the spotlight rather than playing inside an ensemble. I watched 2 episodes and gave up."
Oh Dear,I should have known this was going to be awful from the opening scene.I'm not sure any of those girls have ever seen a football let alone play football.This is just a saga of nothing happening. I'm 3 in and it's very poor. Ok I guess if you're mid late teens and not very bright.
"Devide rating in half, and watch it prepared to be dissapointed.","Show is unfortunately below average despite having good actors and good music.Main problem I see with it, is that the show itsef doesn't know exactly what it wants to be.At first it seems it's going to be a horror, then drama, then teen-drama, to reveal at the very end that it was a grotesque-teen-cringe-dark-comedy. And none of it works.It's hard to describe my disappointment in detail without revealing parts of the show, so the only thing I can say is that it is beyond me why at the time of writing this review, it has above 7 rating. Beware that if you want to watch a 7 stars show, this one might not be it. I for one, won't be watching 3rd season when/if it comes out."
"8 for first season, 2 for second season","If only i could rate separately for each season...
The first season very good with multifaceted mystery, nice balance between past and nowdays story plot, interesting use of parallel stories (although the story with Shaunas adultery took too much time and was quite boring...) and left expectations for something very good.Now the second season... Sloppy!!!And honestly im too kind... i mean really? Did the director or the screenwriter of the first season got ill and put someone completely useless to coninue??The escalation of the mystery drop instantly from 9 to 0,5.... the explanations of the ""mysteries""(there wasnt really any mystery...) was so cheap. All the season was a pointless back and forth reminding a cheap soap opera. The motives and the actions of the characters most of times was so stupid without any consistency on the character (propably thats the reason the acting of the actors looked so bad too), just to show a pointless rupture or a death etc... Completely lack of cause and effect. (and believe me i like David Lynch...).In few words a dissapointing sloppy series!!!"
Abysmal.,"Without a doubt the biggest capitulation in television history. Season 1 was brilliant. I've never been more angry about an episode of television than the finale of season 2 even after all the warning signs in the previous few episodes. Such a garbled mess wrapped up in convenient little plot twists with enough signposts to rebuild the shack that Coach Ben managed to successfully burn down (sorry, spoilers but literally the only good thing to happen. Just a shame everyone inside managed to escape). At least Game of Thrones had the benefit of a few seasons worth of George RR Martin literature to spell it out before the TV writers ruined that. I think the writers here lost their minds even before their own characters did. Seriously it's a train wreck. Don't waste your time. I'd give it half a star for the aforementioned shack burning but one is the minimum and the soundtrack was good too I guess."
Check some more boxes,"I'll review again later, but so far, I find this sickening. I'm very disappointed that great talents put themselves into this kind of lazy crap that has been done over and over."
very boring and annoying series,"The show keep jumping back and forth every 5-10 mins. The director must have ADHD, extremely annoying. Watched 4 eps and really nothing exciting about it. This is very old type of plots... stranded, no food and most likely end up eating each other. Then the left over got recued and they got really mess up afterward! Bla bla bla..."
What a waste,Did you guys just forgot what they've showed us in the beginning of the show ?!If jackie was frozen then what the heck was that in the beginningand also this couldn't be a real tv show cause they've show a lot of meaningless scenes that they can just cut it in the editing.
Disappointed,"While I get this show is going back to the plane crash and fwd to present day, it's SUPER CONFUSING! It would be nice if they let you know.what the time span is. I'm still trying to figure out which characters were which from past and present!!"
Hilariously bad.,"I had high hopes for this, not enough good horror tv shows anymore and the 90s vibe with this kinda story looked really promising but it clearly was more into getting multiple series by stretching every little thing, making every episode pretty uneventful or stupid. It was so forced in places, the writing is genuinely terrible and most bits seemed just cut/copied from other films.Ignoring the face the cast a really poor lead, the woman from two and a half men was awful in this, genuinely poor and it hurt the show a lot, she had one face for every emotion, most of the adults except CR were poor actors but the characters were all pretty stupid anyway.They just lazily make jumps and expect viewers just to accept and go along with it, one girl has magical powers, one girls suddenly so stubborn she'll freeze to death, one can get ravaged by a wolf and randomly survive when her friends start cremating her. It's idiotic.Not a chance I watch series 2, that Lottie character is abysmal and ridiculous but the one plot that was even worse was the kidnap one, senseless, plus she let her go then she stayed anyway only to get released again and meet her demise, it was awful.The reveal of the psychotic behaviour was no shock but I also don't believe people can live in a house unaware of a room that size. The relationships are easily broken. They're all brittle and have no chemistry.The Adam character sucked. The child was really weird about how she chose to deal with it, the leads just a complete piece of trash in every way, there's not one person you'd route for, except maybe Natalie, but her adult version is too hard to like.This would've been better with one long series, 15-18 episodes and done. But instead we get this unfocused directionless mess with awful characters and no real pay off. Just idiotic bears.It's not a thriller, it's not a horror it's barely 90s style.It's one of the worst shows I've ever seen."
Go watch The Wilds instead,"Seriously, I am confused as to why this has a better rating than The Wilds. The characters feel a lot more generic than in that show and also less believable in some cases. Misty is the biggest weak link for me. It's only two episodes in and she is already shutting off the distress signal just because some people complimented her wilderness survival skills, really? She's part of a champion soccer team, this can't be the first time she has ever received external validation. I don't know what motivates her. Is she a traumatized bullied kid or is she a violent sociopath who has always longed to be free of the confines of civilization? IRL usually sociopaths are the bullies, not the bullied. Making her both an awkward loser we are supposed to root for (maybe?) and also a villain feels like stereotyping of awkward nerd kids as secret psychos who deserve all the bullying they get, which isn't a healthy message to be sending. And also, is the show really trying to pass her off as ugly, or are they trying to parody the put-pretty-actress-in-glasses-and-call-her-ugly trope that I would think society should have moved past by now? And she is STILL calling herself ugly as an adult who looks like Christina Ricci, what??Her character really ruins the show for me.The other characters are ok but I feel like I have seen them before. The Wilds used a lot of these same character types but gave them more depth. This show just takes the most basic archetype version and expects us to care, why? I don't know, but I'm not sure I will be continuing."
"Good premise, poor execution","What started with a promise of teen psychological horror with real horror of being lost in wilderness and starving, very quickly became ridiculous. Noone even tried to make these girls look like they were starving. The weird cult thing with Lottie being very obviously mentally ill just didn't work, it was such a cliché with purple people making honey and having crying sessions. The adult Shawna was pretty fun at first, but her and ""the girls"" getting rid of Mark's body was a start of it all being just ridiculous. Juliette Lewis's character was so over the top, I just couldn't stand scenes with her. S2 got worse and worse, peeking at a little musical number with Elijah Woods and the whole survivors bunch wearing masks and trying to kill Shawna even though they agreed that Lottie was crazy?? I watched last 3 episodes on fast-forward, just got so bored with all the conversations about nothing, adult women jumping between believing and not-believing Lottie, then those two cops showing up to make things even more awkward... Didn't care about any of it.Good stuff:
Misty with an axe right after the crashShawna as a bored housewife killing and serving a rabbit to her familyMark being actually in love with ShawnaJackie's deathshrooms and the chase afterShawna's babyBad stuff:
introducing paranormal, it ruined psychological side of being survivors in a wildernessLottie and her purple people cult, such a clichéJuliette Lewis's over-the-top actingall the criminal activities and two cops involvedall the comic/non intentionally comic stuff - I thought it was supposed to be a horror or at least a thriller?.as much as I love Elijah Woods, his character here just doesn't go with anything. And his musical number... WHY?Not sure I'll be bothered to watch s3."
Ain't all what it's cut out to be,"I really wanted to like Yellowjackets. With an interesting concept and great actors, it definitely had a lot going for it. At the end of the day though, I believe this show was severely overhyped.Like I said, it has an interesting concept, but the execution is just all over the place. I feel like if took 2 episodes to introduce us to the characters and show the crash, then use the rest of the episodes to weave in the modern lives of the survivors and the girls surviving the crash, I feel like it would be a lot better.The pacing is really all over the place, and the drama isn't even there. So by the time you get to the last scene in the show, it just feels like fluff to get you invested into the second season.The one thing I really liked though was the acting. It is really strong throughout, and everyone is casted extremely well. But, the acting over shines the writing, which is not a great thing. The acting and the writing have to be great and have to complement each other.Overall, you just have say, is this show really worth me paying $10.99 a month? Is this show really a 9/10 on IGN? Is this show really worth 10 hours of my time? For me, it wasn't."
"7,9 ! Way overrated","I don't get it .cause if you rate this above 7 ,then the show must have some sort of tension in the plot!! BUT ITS FLAT AND BORRING!!! Back n forth in time it makes my head spin .This show , spite the actual great acting ,was a HUGE disappointment . All this hallucinations going on ,at some of the characters,is a pile of overdramatic fiction ! I just can't take it serious .Never compare this show with Lord of the flies , actually the first book i read and if you haven't read it ,then your missing out on a classic/Cult.Season 1 might be a build up for a better season 2 ,but i doubt it.!!"
Strings out an interesting story line but falls flat,"It starts out fairly interesting and somewhat compelling. It quickly devolves into a teen angst melodrama with some truly absurd plot points. It's much ado about nothing. Had to downgrade this review after trying to watch Season 2. It's awful, simply awful. Whatever intrigue existed in the first season is completely absent from Season 2."
This really is the Pits,"You have decent actors, really showing that they getting paid for not giving a dam, over-acting, screaming, it's total boring cack.A load of boring @@@@ built round a supposed mystery
dire, and guess what season 2 has been made,
some good series have been canned, and cack like this renewed."
The Pilot - Spoilers,"There's no mystery here, so any interest will just be watching to see what they do with the entire Lord of the Flies theme.If they actually fool us and the girls who didn't already show cruel, backstabbing, or sociopathic tendencies, that might be a twist.One has to get past that the girls would turn feral and cannalistic within a relatively short period of time.However, on the other hand girls and women can be much crueler toward other females in a heartbeat, so not so much a stretch other than getting past the, when did they have the time and energy to make elaborate costumes while they were starving to death?But then maybe you need to do that in order to hide yourself while eating your comrade and committing other astrocities."
Disgusting and dissapointing,"Something unusual I did not expect to encounter in a show that I was anticipated to watch: I couldn't finish the first episode. I turned off this joke of a TV series as soon as I saw awfully directed sex scene of a 16yo kids on a fifth minute of the first episode. Don't ever watch this piece of garbage. You won't see what sinopsis promises you, only in-your-face teen drama with weird focus of intimacy.Watch this disaster of a series only if you are really into a teenagers having sex in their 16-s. The one thing this show misses is a behind-the-scene laugh on every pause during dialogues, maybe that would make it somewhat interesting to watch."
"The First season was amazing, the second season sucks horribly","The first season was a fantastic mix of story, mystery and acting. Every episode felt like something important happened and you wanted to keep watching every week. The first season is amazing, I will say.The second season is a different story. It drags on and on and on, so far in the 6th episode, and they made it feel totally different. It's not a mystery anymore, but instead a cooky, zany show that feels more like a black comedy. You'll see Shauna and her Husband make mistake after mistake, like clumsily, in an investigation being conducted by douche cop that you just want to punch. They turned Misty into a complete dork. She was a dark, weird and odd character, now she's a geek. I just can't say enough about how bad the second season is."
"This is good, but..","Just like what everyone said about this series, the acting was very good! I love how this story was going from a plane crush to something dark with cult, idk. And Misty got really the character such as an annoying girl.But this show is too slow, I mean, it could be more quick to find out what happened right there. I really hate it just like wasting time to get end this episode. When I watched tbis, I really hope it will be end just for 1 season, but it's not. Feels like boring if there're another season."
Just watch season 1,"I couldn't stand the sexual scenes, which were too many and unnecessary for the most part.There was one very predictable death scene.I watched the series because my favorite actor was in it. Peter Gadiot has never let me down in a film, and he didn't with Yellowjackets. Despite the role he was given, I am amazed at the charisma and color he brought to every scene, his scenes were very different from others. He has many expressions and a striking personality. Anyway, very good actor.The actresses who played Misty. Love them both. She's weird, very intelligent, her actions were spontaneous and as I said ""weird"". She was out of the stereotype that the other girls put on. I love seeing a character with a stand out personality. Whether it be good, bad, a villainess, a psychopath, etc.I only watched season 1. I didn't feel like watching season 2, but everyone is free to make up their own mind. I don't judge the actors, nor the fans of it."
Meh,"Good story, with un-relatable people, seen through an extremely feminist prospective, surviving an unlikely scenario. Bottomline, Lord of the Flies meets Mean Girls."
Turn down the volume on the musical parts,"Just started watching this series and it appears to be interesting enough to continue watching at least through Episode 2.However, I am extremely annoyed with the increased volume of the musical accompaniment in comparison to the voice audio - I find myself constantly reducing the volume to avoid bombarding my ears with the music accompaniment. Hence, the 2-stars.If I continue to watch the show, I'll have to have the remote handy or I may just decide it is not worth the effort.Why do producers do this?!! If viewers wanted a musical, then viewers know how to select a musical genre for their entertainment.Hopefully, I am not the only one - we need to let producers know that our ears need a break."
"So many mistakes, it's a pain to watch","I came upon this recently and tried to work through the first episodes. To keep the review short, I barely managed to work through the first season, only because my significant other enjoyed it enough.I'd like to focus on writing. It is hilariously, atrociously bad. Mistakes and plotholes are everywhere and in many degrees of magnitude. From tiny things, like a rifle having no recoil or a double-barrelled shotgun making a ""ka-chunk"" sound when cocked, to medium-grade quirks like the girls having a party after surviving a car crash and having their friends die, viciously, in front of their eyes or the girls again, in another insurance, deciding on an impromptu viking funeral pyre on their still-alive compatriot after surviving a wolf attack, to major holes like characters having erroneous in-character insight on affairs or the surreality of a non-responsive, obviously fake world where a plane crash is not investigated in the slightest.The constant (and I mean constant) stream of mistakes destroys any suspension of disbelief and spews you right out of the clutches of the series' scenario. Acting couldnt save it. Some actresses (like older Nat, for example) even further amplify this by having performances so chaffing, a piece of sandpaper would be envious. Production is OK, nothing special, someI'd like to ask you: Who writes this? How old are they? Who hired them and who keeps them on-board? The results is a ridiculous, shallow high-school drama in the mountains."
Take you to the nowhere,I actually watched the whole first season with the expectation that soon something would come out to make sense.. but it did not. It's a 'Teenager movie' with some bad after-taste again that only takes you to the beginning of the second season. There are no answers in the first season at all.. so it was pointless to watch it for so long. Second season?.. No thank you.
So far,And for season 2! I wrote and review for 1 in an account I can't get back into but I liked it about half way thru and I think I gave it a 71/2? But I could barely get thru the first episode! I did not think we were going to be seeing the wilderness for a second season! I thought it got interesting last season with them trying to figure out who was trying to sabotage them and the kidnapping in the end but now we have to go back to the forest?!? I had already given up on that part and knowing completely what happened and now I'm foreced to watch it all over again! I don't think it necessary or needed. They should of just expounded on the now timeline and let it all unravel from there. And I know I should wait to write a review but I've read the way this season is to play out. I'll continue in hopes that guy Lynski was seeing brings some answers as well as anything in the now!
l dont understand,"L just want to know how much of these show is a bunch of people/teenagers running like idiots form a killer (or whatever its trying to kill them) and how much is stupid over exagerated drama where everybody is constalntly averreacting to the slightiest issue. Cause for what lve seen in the trailer and the current tendency for teenage targeted shows, it seems to be that way."
"Title should really be ""Travis, featuring The Yellowjackets"".","Bunch of girls crash land into the deep woods, and the show flips between scenes from them young, and scenes of them as adults. Possible cannibalism, who knows (no spoilers). That is what the show is kind of about, but in reality it's about this boring, generic, moody, unlikable guy named Travis. In the past, girls crying over this clown, in the future, still crying about this clown while investigating what happened to him. It's infuriating. Everything, other than Travis, is amazing, especially Christina Ricci, I've never seen her play over-the-top insane before, and she's great at it. Seriously, scenes in the past are pretty much crazy stuff happens, look how Travis reacts to that, and look at how the girls react to Travis reacting to that. It does my head in."
Difficult to give it the credit it deserves...,"A tough one to review- Yellowjackets has a lot going for it. The opening episode is compelling and leaves you wanting more teasing creepy ambiances, and a Lord of the flies meets Blair Witch/The ritual mash-up to come.The mellow-drama is going to be a love-it or hate it component for many. Other reviewers mention it drags on, and while I have to agree for the most part the teen angst and comparatively dull and uninspired side plots didn't grab me, and left me more frustrated and bored than anything else. Still, if that's you're cup of tea I can respect that and won't fault the writers for layering it on thick given the vibe they were going for.The 90's throwback vibe feels a little bit try-hard at times (a little too eager to be trendy and nostalgic for its own good). I'm all for suspending disbelief, and not one to actively try to find plot holes, but as other reviews have mentioned there are some pretty glaring inconsistencies in character reactions that make it a little difficult to stay absorbed.Admittedly many of my critiques are more a matter of taste, so I could forgive most of those perceived shortcomings. The real Achilles heel with Yellowjackets isn't so much that there is a wildly anticlimactic ending, it's that in an entire season it makes and breaks a very important promise to the viewer; not one single plot line, or story arc is resolved. It's not even that nothing gets resolved to satisfaction, Yellowjackets has the taint of modern skinner-box television, ""lost syndrome"", cliffhangers that never resolve themselves (and as it turns out, weren't really cliffhangers to begin with). It's a season designed to prepare the viewer for season 2, and after so many of these (and so many of these shows that often fail to deliver) it's more than anything just a frustrating viewing experience.So as a general rule, if you're going to mimic the HBO/Showtime epic formula, and make your viewer slog through an endless maze of apathetic drama you'd better at least make sure theres a scrap of cheese in the end. That's where Yellowjackets fails to deliver. Most of the glowingly positive review on here seem to be written 2-3 episodes in, which is understandable. It's much more disappointing to digest the season as a whole.On a related note- love or hate the performances of the young actors and their older counterparts, a special kudos should go to whoever did the casting. The evolution and portrayal here is fantastically consistent. As much as the 90's nostalgia fest felt forced to me, the adult actors they picked (intentionally or not) were a clever tool to invoke that nostalgia- Christina Ricci, Juliette Lewis, and Melanie Lynskey all hold their own (regardless of how I feel about their characters). Their performances hit the mark (even if the characters themselves don't seem to make the most sense). The younger cast is more of a mixed bag, but feels appropriately casted.So overall is it worth a watch? Well on that one I can't say I'm sure. I think I'm a little to old, a little to impatient to appreciate the first season, and with such an unsatisfying ending I wouldn't recommend it for anyone watching for a plot. If your goal is to absorb a ""mood"" or ""aesthetic"" I'd say it will probably hit the mark for you.____________________________________________________________Season 2 update: I actually liked it a little more than the first (contrary to general consensus.) The soundtrack is a bit less cloying, and the mellodrama seems toned down. Christina Ricci, Juliette Lewis, and Melanie Lynskey continue to kill it. However my initial criticisms feel vindicated- A string of endless cliffhangers that go nowhere. Storylines and characters abandoned and introduced as needed to keep you watching. Not much satisfaction to be had in the way of plot development. Season 1 was designed to get you to watch season 2. Episode one of season 2 was designed to get you to watch episode 2. Not for your entertainment, but for your engagement. 5/10 for me still, all things considered."
So many issues,"I love the premise of this show. I found the mystery and the friendship between the girls to be fun as well. The non linear storytelling keeps me yearning for more of each timelines story.But this also all feels gratuitous- way too much gore and way too much sex.I'm no prude and enjoy adult films but when you have an hour long episode and 15-20 minutes is just sex scenes that serve no real purpose, then I just start fast forwarding until I get back to plot. The majority of the sexualization happens to the young girls in the forest and it just feels wrong.The gore: it is duly understood that any lord of the flies adaptation, especially one involving a plane crash will call for some blood but it's as though they're stretching to think what awful thing they can subject us to next. I didn't near to hear the very exaggerated sounds of an animal being killed while wearing headphones.If they just focused on the actual plot rather than trying to ""first season GOT"" it, this would be great.The performances of the older actress are really to be applauded. I'm loving Melanie Lynsky!"
Tree timelines at once is too much,"I read good things about Yellowjackets, gave it a try: episode one starts with tree timelines ... It's just too much, and not enough interesting to follow. I'll fast forward to episode 2, to give myself a chance to enjoy what other people enjoyed."
Soft porn and cigarettes.,"What is wrong with the producers of TV series, and films for that matter. Is the tabacco industry paying them for this? I turned the movie off at the second cigarette that came into view. Utterly disgusting to still make hidden advertisement for a product that ruins peoples lives. Also that was only a couple of minutes in, I had to endure no less than three porno graphic scenes in that short period of time. I am not talking about a kiss, or a ""and then they went to bed"" suggestion that has value with regards to the plot, no - orgasms, with all the sound that goes with them. Anyway, rated 1 for not being able to watch more than a few minutes and especially putting smoking people in a 2023 movie as if it a normal thing."
Episode 2 is entirely too dark,"The plane crashes & the most of this episode takes place in a forest at night. I couldn't see what was going on. The other smaller parts were in people's homes but also at night: people in bad moods sulking in dark bedrooms, a couple fantasy role playing in a dark bedroom, a lesbian black couple with a kid -1st in front of a tv in a dark living room, & then making shadow animals with hands & flashlight in a kids dark bedroom, & a meeting in a dark bar. Every part of this episode except for maybe 10 minutes was TOO DARK to make out what was happening."
Tedious,"It's definitely got potential but gosh does it drag. I watched six episodes of this show, thinking it'll get better, it'll start to make sense, everything will fall into place, but it doesn't. It drags and drags. You care very little about any of the characters and each episode could be played out in ten minutes. Ultimately this is poorly written with badly thought out character exposition and tedious plotting."
SO SLOW,"I was really interested in the synopsis of this show, so I decided to watch it. After the first season I can say I don't like it. I truly can't understand what the actual plot is of this show because nothing is ever answered, even like slight hints towards things. It's really all up in the air, and actually really annoying. For 9, 58 minute long episodes, they could definitely had cut it down to 5 or so? I'm not a fan of some of the acting as well, Natalie is the least like able character which I'm assuming she is supposed to be ""damaged"" and ""sad"" but they give her zero redeeming qualities. Will not continuing watching unfortunately :/"
Worst characters I've seen in a while..,"I wanted to like this show, but I honestly hated every single main character. This show does nothing to get you to connect, sympathize, or understand the characters - or why they do what they do. Sure, they experienced a traumatic plane crash. However, my sympathy can only go so far. Some of the girls are just downright disgusting and horrific with their actions - and this is before the weird survivalist activities start. I don't care for them as adults either since they are still just as insufferable. The constant back and forth between past and present also grows very tedious. I don't know how to put it into words, but the pacing is just incredibly off and it takes way too long to get into the interesting plot points (there aren't many). Overall, everything falls flat, and it's impossible to get bad the horrible characters."
